He's not in here. He's not in here, either! He's not in here, either! Where the heck...are you?! We've finally...made it this far! Where are you...?! Where are you? Sasuke! Sakura, huh? Sa...su...ke. Sasuke... So it's you, Naruto...? <i>You don't even have
parents or siblings...</i> <i>What do you know about me?!</i> <i>You've been alone from the start!</i> <i>What do you know about me?! Huh?!</i> <i>It's having the bond that
makes it painful!</i> <i>You've no idea
what it's like to lose that...!</i> <i>You're right.</i> <i>I don't know about having
real parents or siblings...</i> <i>If that's the case...</i> <i>Why Naruto...?</i> <i>Why do you go so far for me...?</i> <i>To me, it's a bond...
I've finally been able to establish.</i> <i>That's why I'll stop you!</i> If that's the case,
then why didn't you...? <i>Then I'll just break that bond!</i> Why didn't you kill me
back then?! Is that how you wanted
to break the bond?! Sasuke! The reason's simple... It's not that I couldn't break
the bond with you... <i>You're one who might be able</i> <i>to use the same Mangekyo
Sharingan as mine...</i> <i>However, there is one condition...</i> <i>You must kill...</i> <i>your closest friend.</i> It was just irritating to me. Obtaining power according to
the method I heard about from him. You're only alive because
of my passing whim. When did he...?! Come to think of it, didn't you have a dream
of becoming the Hokage...? If you had the time to
chase after me, you should've spent that
time training or something... Right... Naruto? And that's why this time around... You'll lose your life... because of my passing whim. There's no way a guy
who can't even save one friend... can ever become the Hokage. Isn't that right...Sasuke? Sasuke...! Naruto... Show him...our...powers. What's the matter...? Why do you hesitate...? You need my power, don't you? Now then... Who do you want to kill...? You should know. That you can't do anything
on your own. SEAL




Break the seal completely! I'll grant you all of my powers
if you do. How...?! I can see it now... So this is your unknown power, huh...? Who would've thought... you'd have something like this
inside of you... I see...
So you're an Uchiha... My how you've grown... To think you'd be able
to see me within Naruto... That loathsome Sharingan... So that's the power of
the cursed clan, huh? It seems this isn't the first time
you've seen the Sharingan. Then...you must be
the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...? That vision, and Chakra
more ominous than mine... It's just like...
Madara Uchiha, from long ago... Heck if I know...that person. <i>Homecoming


Did you find it?</i> <i>All clear here.</i> <i>Target acquired!</i> Uh-oh! It'll get into the village! No way will we let it get away! What the--?! Where'd it go? That way! Hey, you squirts! Hey! W-We're sorry! What're you doing?! Sorry! Sorry about that. Ichiraku Ramen I'm going out for a small delivery. Whoa! Outta the way! Sorry, pops! Hey, Naruto! No, I mean... Konohamaru! Konohamaru!
We've cornered the target. Hurry up. It'll get away! No problem! Why you--! - Give it up already!
- Konohamaru! I got him! A ribbon on the right ear...
No doubt about it. Ebisu Sensei, we captured
the lost pet target "Dora." Heh-heh... Mission complete! Oh, my adorable Dora! I was worried to death about you.
Where were you? I'd want to run away too, if an old lady like that
were my owner... Konohamaru! All right, here is the reward. Now then, let's go home, Dora. How many hours did it take
you guys to catch a simple lost cat?! But that cat was incredibly quick... And he seemed accustomed
to running away... I don't want to hear
any excuses! A mission like this must be carried out
more quickly and properly! You guys are not good enough! I can't display my true strength
on a lame mission like this! Say, Iruka Sensei. Don't you have more of
an awesome mission for me? Listen... Konohamaru... Konohamaru, you guys just
became Genin. There's no way I can give missions
like that to you right off the bat, right?! It'll be D-rank missions
until further notice. I can't be satisfied with that! After all, in the future I'm going to become
the Seventh Hokage. Seventh? Not the Sixth? Brother Naruto's going to be the Sixth. Brother Naruto, huh...? I wonder where he is right now... I bet he'll return having become
an awesome Shinobi. I have faith in him! He's more of a Second Naruto
than a Seventh Hokage... <i>Naruto... Are you holding up okay?</i> <i>No matter what, I'll get strong
and bring Sasuke back!</i> Quite a bit of time has passed
since he said that and went off for real training
with Master Jiraiya... Yes. Isn't it just about the time
he should be returning? We need him to return. After all, there will probably be
significant developments sometime soon. Hey... Could that be...? Yeah... No doubt about it. Miss Sakura! Oh, Konohamaru! Where are you off to? The main village gate. I have to pick up the morning pedestrian
traffic ledger for Lady Tsunade. You want to come? It's been about two and a half years. Yeah, it has... And then that Dora cat suddenly
starts scratching me like crazy! We had missions like that, too.
It kind of takes me back. Come to think of it, have you heard anything
from Brother Naruto?! Nothing...yet. I see... He should be coming back soon, though... Hello, Izumo, Kotetsu. Oh, look who's here... Why don't you head on into town? You'll see something interesting. Something interesting...? Don't tell me! He's having a ball... This takes me back!
The village hasn't changed a bit! Everyone! Naruto Uzumaki's back! It's all so nostalgic...! Yup! Yup! They added GrandmaTsunade's
Mountainside Image! For real...? For real! Naruto? Is that you, Naruto? When did you get back, Naruto?! Just now! Long time no see, Sakura! You've gotten taller than me,
haven't you? Huh...? Oh! You're right. <i>He kind of...got
a build since I saw him last...</i> So? You think I've become
a bit womanly? You're fine!
You haven't changed a bit. <i>You just don't understand
the heart of a woman...</i> Brother Naruto! Sexy Jutsu! Ohh! Wha--?! How about that?!
Pretty nice waist, hips and bust, huh?! Konohamaru...
I'm not a kid anymore. And you too, shouldn't be using Jutsu...
like that... <i>That's right. It isn't just
your appearance that's matured...</i> <i>I kind of feel a bit lonesome,</i> <i>but you've turned out quite admirable,
haven't you, Naruto?</i> <i>Knowing you, I bet you came back
having acquired some incredible Jutsu.</i> That's such a boring Jutsu! Check out my freshly
developed New Pervy Ninjutsu! <i>Right... Like the New Pervy Ninjutsu...</i> Here we go! Hey, you idiot! You haven't changed at all,
have you, you jerk?! After seeing each other for
the first time in like two years! You make me do this
in barely two minutes! What am I supposed to do with the feelings of admiration
I had for you earlier, huh?! <i>- That short temper and incredible strength.
- I'm not the least bit lonesome!</i> <i>- She's a second-generation Tsunade.
- Huh? God, I'm mad at myself!</i> <i>Just like I thought,
Sakura hasn't changed at all...</i> <i>In fact, I get the feeling she's
even more vicious than before...</i> Huh? Did you say something? It's been a long time, you two. I'm sure your training produced
good results, right? Do you think we came back
without making progress? It went perfectly! Then show me those
results immediately. Show you...? You will take on a particular man. I didn't send him on any missions
for the past several days and had him standby
for this very purpose. Your opponent will be... Come in! Oh! Today at around five
in the afternoon, Security Ninja were found collapsed at the fortress of
the Village Hidden in the Sand. No signs of dispute were found
within the scene of the crime; leading officials to believe
the crime might have been committed by someone in the village,
or a skilled intruder. Around the same time,
there have been reported sightings of two men dressed in black clothing
with red cloud patterns. They are likely connected
to the incident. Next time:
"The Akatsuki Makes Its Move"

It's been a long time, you two. I'm sure your training produced
good results, right? Do you think we came back
without making progress? It went perfectly! Then show me
those results immediately. Show you...? You will take on a particular man. I didn't send him on any missions
for the past several days and had him stand by
for this very purpose. Your opponent will be... Come in! Hello. Shikamaru! Temari!
Look who's here! Naruto. Hey! That is you isn't it, Naruto! Shikamaru! <i>This is...that little shrimp...?</i> So you're back? Yeah, I got back this morning. You don't look
as stupid as before... I mean, hey, have you changed? No, he hasn't. Oh...I thought so. Sakura. Then, does this mean
you're my opponent, Shikamaru? Opponent? What do you mean? I just came to deliver
some documents. Huh? You're not
my opponent, Shikamaru? Then...? Who're you again? You don't remember me? Naruto, that's not your opponent. He's out there. You sure got tall...Naruto. Yo! Kakashi Sensei! <i>The Akatsuki Makes Its Move


</i> Sensei, you haven't changed one bit! Oh yeah. Listen, listen...
I've got a present for you, Sensei. This is sure a nostalgic sight. Yes, it is... What?! You got me... Th-This is... This is the first new title in
the Make-Out series in three years! I think it's totally boring, but you like this stuff,
don't you, Sensei?! <i>That idiot...No way could
a kid understand the appeal.</i> <i>And on top of that,</i> <i>it's a very rare item that hasn't
even been released yet...</i> All right! That's enough fun
for now, Kakashi. <i>Don't tell me...
Are you  my opponent...?</i> Hmm, not quite... Gee, it's been a while
since I saw you too, Sakura. Yes, it has, Kakashi Sensei. My opponent will be... Naruto...and Sakura,
the both of you! Kakashi Sensei's our opponent... I want to see what you
can do against Kakashi... I will determine your status
in the future based on the results. Status, eh? Sakura, show me that you weren't just wasting
your time training under me. Yes, ma'am! Then, shall we get right to it? <i>That's what I'd like  to say.</i> But since you just got back Naruto,
you must be tired. I'll give you a short rest. I'm not particularly tired
or anything! Let's meet up at
the Third Training Grounds later. See ya. Why's he in such a hurry? I have a pretty good idea... He's going to read his book. Oh! With that look he had,
there's no doubt about it. <i>That's the obvious reaction</i> <i>after getting an unreleased copy
of one of my books.</i> That Kakashi Sensei. Is that stupid book
more important to him than the results of our training? Well, now we can discuss our strategy
against Kakashi Sensei. So, are you guys on a date? It's not like that. Heh! Cut out the jokes. Why would I be on
a date with this guy? It's almost time for
the Chunin Exams. I've just been going back and forth
between the Sand and the Leaf for meetings concerning the Exams. And although it's a pain, I've been put in charge
of the Exams... I've just been told to act as
a guide for the Sand messenger. Chunin Exams, huh...? That sure takes me back... Oh... So what're you going to do, Naruto? About what? About the Chunin Exams. You're the only one from our class
who hasn't become a Chunin. What?! Th-Then, you're also a Chunin, Sakura? Heh-heh...That's right. And just for the record,
Kankuro, this person here, and Neji who's one grade above us
are already Jonin. Huh?! Then what about Gaara?! Lord Kazekage... The meeting is about to begin. Okay. I see... So Gaara became the Kazekage, huh...? That's awesome... I won't be outdone! I'll become the Hokage,
no matter what! Just you wait, Gaara! <i>I guess...
he has matured a little, after all.</i> What do you think?!
Pretty good, huh...? It is my finest work. I leave Naruto in your care
as promised... It'd be nice if he's grown
at least a little. Heh... You'd think I've slipped up? You'll get beaten out
if you get careless. Well, that's encouraging to hear. And their actions are
gaining momentum. Over the past several years, the strength of our village
has stabilized, and relations with the Hidden Villages
in each allied land have prospered. In particular,
we have achieved good results in our development of recruits
with the curriculum incorporating... the training program
from the Leaf Village. The Chunin Exams are almost here.
I look forward to the results. However... at this time,
with the Chunin Exams upon us, there is a nasty rumor
going around... What is it, Yura? Have you heard of the organization
called the "Akatsuki"? I see... So they're finally
making their move. It's something we were expecting
to a degree, though. The Akatsuki, huh...? The Akatsuki is a mysterious organization
composed of a dozen or so Shinobi. The members of the organization
are vicious S-Rank criminals all listed in the Bingo Book. Of those identified... there is Itachi Uchiha from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves who drove his own clan
to annihilation in one night. There is Kisame Hoshigaki who was once a member of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist. He was known as
the phantom of the Mist. And there is Orochimaru who once plotted the destruction
of the Leaf... and assassinated
the previous Kazekage. It is said he used to be
a member of this organization. Why have they started taking
such dramatic action? What's their goal? <i>That's beyond me at this point...
What I do  know...</i> is that they're after
what's inside Naruto. And...that they've got something evil
in mind. I passed on this information to those in charge of security
for each land. I sure hope they tighten up
their security immediately. I see... I'd heard the rumors... So the organization in question
is finally taking action... The source of the information
is Lord Jiraiya, one of the legendary Sannin. So prior to the meeting, I took the liberty of issuing an order
to increase Village security. Anbu Black Ops masters
have already been stationed at key points around the village. No matter how powerful
the Shinobi may be, they will not be able
to infiltrate by force. I hear the members of the Akatsuki
wear black clothing in addition to capes with
a red cloud pattern on them. I ordered security to attack
with full force should they see someone
fitting that description. Now then...
the meeting is adjourned. Well done, Yura. I never thought you'd take action
so quickly. I have also served as
a superior for four years. It is my intention... to always make decisions
while considering... what's in the best interest...
of the...village. SEAL What's the matter? Nothing... It's nothing at all... I just haven't slept much... I see...You need to take care
of yourself. Thank you for your concern. <i>I see... That's right...</i> I see. So we have to deal
with this one, then go after the guy
we sent to Orochimaru, huh? It seems he turned traitor
and leaked information about us. It can't be helped. Even I don't know what happens
after the Jutsu is cast. More importantly,
will just that bag be enough? Our opponent will be
using the Jinchuriki. All of my Jutsu are works of art. And I made sure to
bring my specialty. After all, our opponent
is the One-Tailed. Third Training Grounds Is Kakashi Sensei
going to make us wait forever?! Well, he's always been like this. Geez, it'd be nice if he'd show
a little improvement. Oh, sorry about that. As it happens, I ran into an old woman
in trouble on my way here and... - Okay! That's a lie!
- Okay! That's a lie! This place...
kind of takes me back. <i>Your task for today is</i> <i>to take these bells away from me
by this afternoon.</i> <i>Those unable to get a bell
will get no lunch.</i> <i>What?!</i> <i>You'll be tied to those posts and</i> <i>then I'll eat your lunch right
in front of you.</i> Oh, come to think of it, this was your first Training Ground,
wasn't it? Squad Seven... The Three-Man Squad, huh...? We had Sasuke with us...
back then, didn't we? <i>Don't go!</i> <i>If you do, I'll scream...!</i> <i>Sakura.</i> <i>Thanks.</i> <i>Sasuke.</i> <i>Sasuke!</i> <i>Yo, goofball.</i> <i>Sasuke's name is
off limits for these guys...</i> Well... Let's see how much
you've grown. You haven't given up
on Sasuke, have you? Absolutely not! That's why I continued my training! The rules are the same
as when we first met. I don't care how you do it.
Just take a bell away from me. - If you don't...
- "come at me with the intent to kill," "we won't be able to get the bells", right? <i>You can use Shuriken
if you want.</i> <i>If you don't come at me
with the intent to kill,</i> <i>you won't be able to get the bells.</i> Exactly. If you don't come at me
with the intent to kill, you won't be able to get the bells. You have until sunrise tomorrow. Now then, shall we begin? You're not going to do it while reading your book
this time around, Kakashi Sensei? Or have you already
finished reading? Nope... I thought I'd save
the fun for later... Besides... Well, I kind of get the feeling... I may have to... get a bit serious this time around. What's that...? Black clothing and
a red cloud pattern. Don't tell me... Is that...? Contact Captain Yura immediately! Captain Yura! Some guys from the organization
in question have shown up. I know. You don't need to worry...
It'll be over soon. Good work, Yura. Do you remember me? Yes, Lord Sasori! Let's go! The time to unveil
my newest work has come. It's been three years
since my previous masterpiece, "Make-Out Violence." You'll forget about time, forget to breathe,
and forget yourself with this, a masterpiece filled with soul. Pre-orders for "Make-Out Tactics" are now being accepted
at the Leaf Shuueidou. Buy it now, everyone! Okay? Stop advertising your book here! Next time:

00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,730
Third Training Grounds Let's go! Shadow Clone Jutsu. Not bad. <i>Nice... Since he's trapped in midair...</i> <i>he used the Shadow Clone Jutsu
as a means for movement.</i> Transform! Okay, that's as far as you go. <i>He's gotten pretty tall.</i> <i>And not only that...</i> <i>His timing for using
the Shadow Clone Jutsu has gotten better.</i> Oho... Not bad. That's incredible. <i>You've grown, haven't you, Naruto?</i> <i>However...</i> Well, it seems you're just
as impatient as ever. I haven't even said start yet,
have I? <i>Don't be so hasty.
I haven't even said start yet, have I?</i> Now then, let's begin. Ready...start! Now then, let's begin! Ready...start! Damn it! I've been had! Come on, Naruto, you goof! <i>The Results of Training


</i> Good work...
Do you remember me? Of course, I do, Lord Sasori. Of course, he does. It wouldn't be much of
a Jutsu if he didn't. They become loyal subordinates
after regaining their memory. I say it's about ready? All right, it's done... Sasori, my good man.
You watch from here... Okay. I'll attack the village... from above. What do you think of
this artistic form...? Don't make me wait too long, Deidara! One-Tail, the Jinchuriki of Shukaku,
Gaara of the desert, eh? Now then, I wonder what he's like. <i>Now...
What're you going to do, Sakura?</i> <i>Right? Above? Left?</i> <i>Behind?</i> <i>If he's in none of those places...</i> He must be below. Huh? <i>Wh-What ridiculous strength.</i> All right, well done. <i>Fifth Hokage...</i> <i>You didn't just teach Sakura
Medical Ninjutsu, huh?</i> That short temper and
incredible strength. She raised a splendid second Tsunade. Kakashi Sensei. Huh? I found you. <i>I'd...I'd better stop acting like
an idiot in front of Sakura.</i> <i>I'll get killed...!</i> <i>She built up her maximum
Chakra inside her body at once</i> <i>and instantly concentrated
all of it into her fist.</i> <i>That's a feat that can't be done
without considerable Chakra control.</i> <i>Medical Ninjutsu along
with superhuman strength...</i> <i>No. It's more than that.</i> <i>Sakura's originally a Genjutsu-type,
after all.</i> <i>She might just become
a better Kunoichi than the Fifth Hokage.</i> <i>All right, now I guess
it's my turn, huh?</i> One. Two. Three. So there are three people
guarding the skies... Still, this village sure has
quite the artistic design to it. It's certainly worth destroying, though... It's time for covert action from here on. <i>There he is.</i> <i>The basics for a Shinobi are</i> <i>to eliminate their presence
and remain hidden.</i> <i>This is totally different from
back then.</i> <i>The basics for a Shinobi</i> <i>are to eliminate their presence
and remain hidden.</i> <i>All right, everyone seems
to be well hidden...</i> Now, fight me fair and square! Say, aren't you just a little bit off there? Let me teach the two of you something. Shinobi Battle Skills, part one...Taijutsu. You're wide open! <i>If I can hit him once...</i> <i>It won't mean a thing
if you don't hit me.</i> Phew, that was a close one. Shadow Clone Jutsu. Here I come! All right, bring it on. The bell's mine. You won't get away! Dancing Leaf Shadow...?! This is Bushy Brow's...! It's Kakashi Sensei's Copy Ninjutsu! Now...where's the real one? Right here. Secret Finger Jutsu. A Thousand Years of Death! Now...where's the real one? Right here! Secret Finger Jutsu! A Thousand Years of Death! Damn it. I missed! That was a close one...
In a different sense. <i>It used to be so easy.</i> <i>I'll tear you apart!</i> <i>Damn it! You can't dodge this!</i> <i>Geez, man!</i> <i>Huh?</i> <i>Ninja don't let their opponent
get behind them over and over, you idiot!</i> <i>Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu!</i> <i>A Thousand Years of Death!</i> She's over there, huh? <i>Sasuke, where are you?</i> <i>Don't tell me Sensei
already got to you!</i> <i>No, that'd never happen to him!</i> <i>I'm safe! He hasn't noticed me!</i> Sakura, behind you. <i>They've been apart for two years,</i> <i>and yet his teamwork with Sakura
isn't that bad.</i> <i>Though I want to...</i> <i>find out what happens next
in the new volume...</i> Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! <i>As always, the sheer number
of his clones amazes me...</i> Let's go! - Yeah!
- Yeah! <i>Good grief... It looks like
I won't have time for reading.</i> Things are getting interesting. Naruto and Sakura
are pretty good, aren't they? Things are just getting started. Now then, what should I do...? Wh-What's this strange thing?! <i>It's not  strange, you know.</i> Sure enough, fools don't understand
what art is all about... I'll show you with your own bodies. True art...is an explosion! I'm sure I heard the sound
of the bells from this way. There's a possibility that
he rang them on purpose. Be careful. Yeah, it's Kakashi Sensei, after all. Sasuke! Sasuke. Naruto, Sakura... Help me. I got away from Orochimaru. Help me. Naruto, Sakura... Please. It's too bad... I want to talk with Sasuke
a little while longer, but... Release! I'm not interested in illusions,
you see. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto, Kakashi Sensei's behind
that tree there. Oh, no! Yeah, I know. Rasengan! Kakashi Sensei. Huh? You have something to say, don't you?
I missed it before. Shinobi Battle Skills, part two...Genjutsu. <i>Huh?</i> <i>What was that just now?</i> <i> Hey! Where'd Sensei go?
Huh? Huh? What's going on?</i> <i>What's what?</i> <i>Sakura.</i> <i>Oh, Sasuke!</i> <i>S-Sakura. H-Help me.</i> <i>She fell for it so easily back then...</i> Kakashi Sensei,
talk about a lack of pizzazz. No way will we fall for the same trick
over and over again. That's right, that's right. No, that's not necessarily the case. All right! He dropped the bells. Naruto, don't. They're mine...! See? Naruto would still fall
for the same trick. Huh? No way will I fall for a trap...
like this. Wha--?! Substitution Jutsu. Damn it. You idiot. Didn't I tell you? <i>Sure enough,
the same tricks won't work, huh?</i> Infiltration successful. That's as far as you go. Can you see the intense smoke
from an explosion? There's great turbulence in the skies
above the Hidden Sand. Can you give us any details? Yes. It appears Lord Kazekage
is engaged in a fierce battle in the sky with an intruder. All the residents can do is watch... Oh! Are you all right? It seems we have lost audio. We will continue to report the moment
we receive more information. Next time:
"The Jinchuriki of the Sand"

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,200
Wh-What's that? Just a little more. You're pretty good. <i>Now that's a handy Jinchuriki.</i> But...how'd you know
I was the intruder? There are no birds like that
in this desert. I see. <i>The Jinchuriki of the Sand


</i> You're pretty good... <i>Now that's a handy Jinchuriki.</i> But...how'd you know
I was the intruder? There are no birds like that
in this desert. I see. Hey! What was that noise earlier?! You're supposed to report immediately
if something happens... Wh-What...happened? Lord Kazekage... What do you mean something strange
got into the village?! Captain Yura was supposed to have
tightened village security. Actually... we have been unable to
contact Captain Yura. Come again?! Oh, man...That Deidara had to go
and turn this into a circus. Yura. You head on back. Things will get complicated if the guys
from the village find you here. Yes, Lord Sasori. Get a move on, Deidara. I don't like to be kept waiting. Gaara! I'm coming in! Where'd he go...? Kankuro, the Kazekage is fighting
up in the sky. Wh-What did you say? Gaara...! The covert action is a failure. But now... I don't have to bother...
looking for you anymore...! He's got the advantage,
as expected... This is a real mess. Over there?! <i>This one is?!</i> <i>A transformation of one
of Naruto's Shadow Clones, huh?!</i> <i>I'm finished if it even grazes me...</i> Shinobi Battle Skills, part three... Ninjutsu! <i>The speed of his seal forming...</i> <i>It's way too fast!</i> Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Where's Kakashi Sensei? Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu! A Shadow Clone, huh?! Water Style! Water Dragon Missile! What?! Using Fire Style, Earth Style
and Water Style consecutively. Ordinarily that's totally impossible. He isn't called the "Copy Ninja"
for nothing... Now I understand how amazing he is. Yeah... <i>This is going to be
a long-drawn-out affair.</i> But there's still plenty of time
until dawn. Yes, there is. Things might just be settled... more quickly than you'd expect... Gaara... It's almost time... The real show's about to begin. There! <i>He uses strange explosives...
And he's able to guide them, huh?</i> I've pretty much got it now. I always knew, but... The Sharingan is really
something else, isn't it? Yeah... But even more than that,
the speed of his seal formation... It's so fast it's tough for us
to even get near him... <i>Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!</i> <i>Water Style! Water Dragon Jutsu!</i> For the time being, we won't have a prayer of getting
the bells unless we can do something
about both his hands. Yeah. That Kakashi Sensei's
incredibly strong for sure. He's smarter than Shikamaru. He has a better sense of smell
than Kiba. His Sharingan is better
than Sasuke's. His Taijutsu is better than
Bushy Brow's. And he's got way more...
experience than us... But even Kakashi Sensei must
have a weakness! If we think hard about it... Hmm. A weakness, huh...? Oh! He does...
have a weakness?! What?! <i>I never thought they'd make me
use my Sharingan this much...</i> <i>But, oh well...</i> <i>I should be able to hang on
until sunrise...</i> <i>I've still got...Shuriken...
and Kunai Knives.</i> <i>Whoops! Mustn't do that.</i> <i>This isn't like the old days.</i> <i>They're too good for me to be
able to fight them while reading.</i> <i>But I want to know what happens.</i> <i>It seems the main character
in "Make-Out Tactics"</i> <i>has some sort of incredible secret...</i> <i>I can't wait to read what's next...</i> R-Really? Did you really figure out
Kakashi Sensei's weakness? You should be able to figure it out if you look back on
his actions up until now. Quit stalling already...
What's his weakness, Naruto? Well, you see... I get it! I never thought he'd have
a weakness like that. See?! It's clear if you think back
on his actions up until now, right? Right, right. In addition to occupying
both his hands, we might be able to seal off
his Sharingan if things go well. And then if we seize the opportunity... Naruto... Sure enough, you're the number one
most unpredictable Ninja! <i>Still, I was so pleased with
how much they've grown</i> <i>that I ended up getting
kind of carried away...</i> <i>I guess this time I'll wait and see
what kind of move they'll make.</i> Now that that's settled,
the first strike will decide this! We'll make the first move! Right! Let's go! All right. They're fast, this time. Gaara! They're here. You're underestimating me. To think you'd attack me
head-on like that. Now, Naruto! Here we go, Kakashi Sensei! At the end of "Make-Out Tactics...!" Wh-What?! As it happens, the main character...! He's giving away the ending!
N-No! Oh, no! I still understand
what he's saying. I can read his lips with my Sharingan. Oh! A Ninja is supposed to read
below what's underneath. Right, Sensei?! You got me... It's just like an eggshell
protecting what's inside. <i>But it's incredible that he was able
to block the explosion completely.</i> Sand Prison! Who'd have thought you'd
ensnare Kakashi by pretending to give away
the ending. That's a pretty good strategy. - You could say that.
- But if I remember correctly, Master Jiraiya's book is
targeted for adults, right? So when did you become an adult? That doesn't count as reading. It was so boring
I quit after just ten pages... It seems he read ten pages. - Okay, you're guilty!
- Huh?! Naruto, for violating the regulations, you are sentenced to clean
the Academy bathrooms for three days! No way! Next episode:
"The Kazekage Stands Tall"

﻿1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,330
This is not good. It's over... Just what you'd expect
from Lord Kazekage! Yeah. This village will be safe as long as we have
Lord Kazekage! Hold on! This sand's such
a pain in the neck. You fool...! Do you really think you can get away
from Gaara's sand?! <i>The Kazekage Stands Tall!


</i> I never thought this would be
my reason for losing...


 I should've just gone ahead
and finished the book... But how can you even
read such a boring book?! Huh? The Pervy Sage loaned it to me, but it was so boring
I didn't even make it ten pages. So of course, I don't know
how the book ends. Even without Naruto knowing
the ending of the book... we figured you'd respond
if we mentioned the name, "Make-Out Tactics." Pretty good strategy, huh? You two certainly showed me
some growth. Master! Kakashi, do you have
something to say? Well, they did a great job
taking the bells away from me, so... Yes. What're you talking about? We're talking about
your status for the future. Our status...? - Naruto Uzumaki!
- Huh? Answer me. Y-Yeah! Sakura Haruno! Yes! The two of you and... Kakashi Hatake... The three of you shall
form Team Kakashi! Team Kakashi... S-Say, what does that mean? The two of you will form
a team with me and we'll carry out
missions together. That's what this means. It's not like the old days. We're no longer teacher
and students. We will work together as
equal Leaf Shinobi. Got it? Sure! I got it! Kankuro! Is Lord Gaara fighting right now?!
Where is he? Yeah. He's up there... Gaara... Sand Coffin... He did it... - He did it!
- Yeah! Lord Kazekage is amazing! Did he get away...?! That guy sure is lucky...! Not bad. <i>I get it.</i> <i>The sand he used to crush
my hand</i> <i>is much faster and more powerful</i> <i> than ordinary sand taken
from the desert...</i> <i>According to our information...</i> <i>He always carries with him
a fixed amount of sand...</i> <i>In other words,</i> <i>only that sand has been...
specially created</i> <i>with a large amount
of Chakra built up inside...</i> <i>That's the sand he uses
for quick defense...</i> <i>as well instant attacks.</i> <i>What did they call it again...?</i> I remember now! It's the "Ultimate Defense" That's the "Ultimate Defense" sand... <i>In other words,</i> <i>the sand from that hole is
what crushed my arm...</i> <i>I've only got a little bit
of clay left...</i> I underestimated him... What you'd call
"not prepared enough." This is just as
the good man Sasori said... <i>Will just that bag be enough?</i> <i>Our opponent will be
using the Jinchuriki...</i> <i>I've only enough left for
one more homing-type...</i> <i>and my specialty as well.</i> I think... I'll destroy this village, after all. For crying out loud... How long is that Deidara going to
make me wait? I told him I don't like waiting... Lord Kazekage... Black clothing and
a red cloud pattern...! Judging from that appearance, the enemy Lord Kazekage
is fighting against is likely a member of the organization
called the "Akatsuki." I knew it. Kankuro. What is it? Gaara's even using
his "Ultimate Defense" sand in this fight. I think it's safe to assume
the enemy is a formidable one. For the time being, we need to consider that
Gaara could lose control. We need to be ready
in case Shukaku appears. The villagers will be in danger. That won't happen anymore. Gaara will not harm
the people of this village. Never! Gaara, give it up. I don't want to say this, but you're nothing but
a frightening weapon to the village... It'll just be a struggle
for you to join a regular unit
at this point. The superiors don't think
well of you. And a majority of the village
is scared of you. I know that... I know that... but I will be overcome
with an even greater suffering if I just wait around... I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself. And I must not run away
from my path of solitude. If I do that, someday... Someday...I can be like him... So as a Sand Shinobi, I will strive to become
the Kazekage. To live...bonded with this village. Gaara... I want to work hard...
and be acknowledged by others. Naruto Uzumaki made
me believe that... Having bonds with others... I only knew hate
and malice up until now. But now, there's something
I understand about those bonds. He went so far to tell me about. I understand that pain,
sadness...and happiness... can be shared with others. Naruto Uzumaki... I learned that through fighting
and getting to know him. He knew of the same pain
as me. And he taught me that I could
change the path of my life. Someday, I want to feel needed
by someone. Not as a frightening weapon... but as the Kazekage
of the Hidden Sand Village. <i>There are people who need you.</i> <i>You're the Kazekage
of the Hidden Sand!</i> Lord Gaara! Lord Kazekage!
Hang in there! Gee, you guys sure got strong. I never thought you'd really
be able to get the bells... I just might've surpassed you,
Kakashi Sensei. Why're you talking all big?! Well, but I'm still pretty young,
you see... The other day, I developed
an incredible new Jutsu... And it's pretty incredible, you see... Oh, that's right. I haven't had any Ichiraku ramen
since I got back! Oh, I'm also pretty hungry from all that training exercise
since yesterday. All right! Let's make a beeline
for Ichiraku Ramen! Right! <i>They used to be so cute
and react to everything back in the day...</i> As promised,
I leave Naruto in your care. It's my first Ichiraku ramen in ages! It'll be Kakashi Sensei's treat! - Treat! Treat!
- Treat! Treat! The actions of the Akatsuki
are gaining momentum... I'm heading off to gather information. See you around. Kakashi Sensei! Huh? It's been settled that you're going to treat us
to some ramen! Hurry up! Sorry, guys! I have to create and turn in
the unit list for the new team! See you. I'm gone. Oh! He ran away! He said something about a unit list... but he's probably just wondering
what happens next in...his book... That means... Then how about we go
on a date, just the two of us? That's fine. But you're treating. Oh... You could at least pay
for half of the ramen... No way! Convene all members
for an emergency meeting! Yes, sir! You secure the reservoir.
Take two units with you! Yes, sir. Seal off the roads in sector A! Yes, sir! We must not assume
there's only one enemy! No matter what happens,
maintain preparations for battle. We must be ready to respond! Medical Team! Set up a barrier and lead
all villagers inside! Hurry! There must not be even one casualty!
Is that clear?! We'll provide full support for Gaara...
No...for Lord Kazekage! Gaara... Interference from below really
puts a damper on things... And besides... I'm tired of looking at
your expressionless face. <i>It's a doll</i> <i>molded from detonating clay
that's got Chakra</i> <i>and clay eaten by my palm
mixed together...</i> <i>This specialty of mine...</i> <i>has C3 Chakra,
my most powerful Chakra,</i> <i>built up inside.</i> <i>The explosive power is
an exquisite work of art</i> <i> that I'm very proud of!</i> - What's that? Hey!
- Yeah, what the heck is it? This is not good! Get back! You're too late. Next time, I will finally develop
an ultra cool Jutsu! The breathtaking arc begins as I take down
the Akatsuki organization! What sort of nonsense are
you coming up with, you idiot! Oh, Sakura... All you'll do is slurp on
some ramen noodles at the corner after being dumped by me! Keep making stuff up,
and you'll get caught by the Police Force! But I want some of
the spotlight too! Shut up, Cha! Next time: "Mission Cleared"

﻿1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,500
Ichiraku Ramen Yeah. Ichiraku hasn't changed a bit! Mm... This aroma...
It's whetting my appetite. All right! Hiya! Welcome! Old man... Do you remember me? Naruto... It's you, isn't it, Naruto?! No way could I forget you! Long time no see! Huh? Naruto? You sure got big! Long time no see, miss! What'll you have?
You're hungry, right? Yeah, I'm starved! All right then, today it's on me. Order whatever you like! All right! No... It's on me today. I knew you'd be here, Naruto! Iruka Sensei! Sakura isn't with you? If I'd known you were going to treat,
I'd have brought Sakura, too... Maybe I should've let him
treat me to half a ramen. Can I get some
more rice-flour anmitsu?! Oh! Wh-What's this? It's Lord Kazekage's sand...! Wow! Look at the size
of the shield he made! Just what I'd expect from the Kazekage. Gaara... Okay, you're within... range! Gaara! <i>Mission Cleared


</i> Okay, you're within... range! Gaara! Fifth Kazekage! I wonder if he's okay... He did it!
You're amazing, Lord Kazekage. Ooh! Gaara's Total Sand Defense
can't be broken that easily. Lord Baki! The preparations for attack
have been completed! All right! Attack all together
when I give the signal! I'd expect no less... His specially-created sand sure
got some quick defense... However... <i>That's just what I want.</i> <i>My left hand was crushed...</i> Sand Coffin. <i>However, I used that opportunity
to eat some of your sand...</i> <i>and mix it with my bomb clay.</i> <i>You were doomed the instant you used
that sand to defend yourself.</i> <i>That being said,
I planned it that way!</i> Art... <i>- Oh, no...
- ...is explosive!</i> Here's an extra-large special serving
of our ramen! It's the real-deal Ichiraku ramen... I dreamed about this ramen
so many times during my training... Now, eat up before it gets cold! Right. Thank you! <i>By the way,
can I ask you a favor, Sensei?</i> <i>You want seconds?</i> <i>Let me wear your Leaf Headband.</i> <i>Oh, this?! No way.</i> <i>This is proof that you've graduated
from the Academy</i> <i>and have been acknowledged
as a full-fledged Ninja, you see!</i> <i>Wait for yours until tomorrow!</i> <i>You cheapskate!</i> <i>- Naruto...
- Huh?</i> <i>You've sure grown
a lot compared to the time</i> <i>when you wanted this...</i> <i>Have I?! Have I?!
Do you think so?</i> <i>This Headband you gave me,</i> <i>it looks perfect on me now, doesn't it?</i> <i>Don't be getting carried away!
You've still got a long way to go.</i> <i>You've still got to do better and better!</i> <i>You've gotten so big...</i> Man, this is good! Sure enough, Ichiraku Ramen
is the greatest! Isn't it, though? But... Hm?! There's one thing
I'm not quite happy with. Naruto... We meet for
the first time in ages and the first thing you do is find fault
with my ramen?! Huh?! It's... It's not like that. I don't have a problem
with the ramen. Then what is it?! I...thought the next time Iruka Sensei
would treat me to ramen would be after I'd become a Chunin... Naruto... All of my classmates have
become Chunin, and I'm the only one
who's still just a Genin. You don't need to worry about
whether you're a Genin or a Chunin. After all, Master Jiraiya
trained you personally... I know, but... But listen, that Pervy Sage
is really merciless! The cloth on the precious Headband
you gave me got all tattered. The same with my clothes, too. So I got this cloth newly made along
with my new threads! But thanks to that intense training,
you've gotten quite strong, haven't you? You should be happy about it. Yeah. I feel like I've gotten
another step closer to becoming the Hokage! Ooh, sounds like you've got
quite the confidence! Yeah! Speaking of which, I heard Gaara of the Hidden Sand
has already become the Kazekage! Oh... That kid's kind of special, so. What do you mean by special? Huh?! You don't become the Kazekage
just by being special. I can tell... I bet...he worked incredibly hard... He worked really hard,
everyone acknowledged him... and then he became the Kazekage! What the hell happened...? G-Gaara... Gaara! Lady Tsunade. Have you decided on
the first mission for Team Kakashi? Naruto and Sakura did
nothing but training for two and a half years, after all. I'm going to have them work off
those two and a half years! Oh, how about something like this...? A VIP escort in the Land of Rice Paddies... This is a B-rank mission, huh...? But Naruto hasn't been on
a mission in quite awhile. Wouldn't an easier mission
be better to start...? Look, how about something like this...? Dog-walking...? This is a D-rank mission! Sakura's a Chunin, and I'm sure Naruto is
much stronger now. <i>I can't send them on
a mission like this !</i> However... there's the issue with
the Nine-Tails to consider. I don't think it's wise to imprudently
send him out of the village too much... That's why I teamed them up
with Kakashi. I...understand that, but... We can at least give them
this mission. I'll concede no further. A gold bullion transport convoy...
A C-rank mission...? Naruto will probably still get miffed.
He'll say it's too easy. Ichiraku Ramen Oh! Sorry about that, old man! Don't worry about it. Man, what a waste. Lord Kazekage! It-It can't be! Gaara's Ultimate Defense
has been... What the hell did he do...? <i>I cause an explosion
at point-blank range...</i> <i>and you're forced to use</i> <i>your speedy gourd sand you crushed
my hand with to defend yourself...</i> <i>However...
then I'm down to my last attack...</i> <i>I had to create an opening</i> <i>in order to cause a sure explosion
at close range...</i> <i>I dropped my "specialty..."
on the village for that very purpose.</i> I guess I'll go retrieve him. I get it. Wh-What's happening...? He's draining his last remaining strength in an attempt to move the sand
outside the village... He wants to make sure the village
isn't damaged! I'd expect no less from the Kazekage... Even when it'd be easier just to
drop it on the village. G-Gaara... Hey, what're you guys doing?!
We must protect Lord Kazekage! Commence attack! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! Fire! Your attacks are futile. Fire! Your attacks are futile, I'm telling you! They got a bit creative, huh...? My man Sasori will be ticked off if
I keep him waiting too long. Is he going to keep me waiting forever? Hang in there, Lord Kazekage! Gaara! Hang in there just a little longer! He did it! <i>Now it's your  turn
to work hard, Naruto.</i> But my opposition's the Kazekage... I'm still just a Genin... But your training with Master Jiraiya
wasn't for nothing, right? I heard you and Sakura were able
to take the bells away from Kakashi. It was more of a cinch than I thought! I might even be stronger
than you, Iruka Sensei! What're you talking about?! I'm a long way from being outdone! We won't know unless we try! Oh, come on! In any event, starting tomorrow, you'll be working as a member
of Team Kakashi, right? Good luck! Right! I'm going to become Hokage
in the future, after all... No way will I be outdone by
the likes of Gaara! Gaara! Rescue Lord Kazekage! <i>It was harder than
I thought not  to kill him...</i> Mission cleared. Gaara! Here is the latest forecast from
today's weather report. Mostly clear skies in
the Hidden Sand Village. However, certain areas may expect
showers of various colored sands. There are also chances of sudden falls
of detonation clay similar to last night. Please be careful
when going outdoors. It is recommended for well-used Puppets
to be placed within Scrolls. That was the forecast report form
the Hidden Sand Weather Station. Next time: "Run, Kankuro"

﻿1
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,430
<i>Run, Kankuro


</i> Damn you! Cease fire immediately!
We might hit Lord Kazekage. Y-Yes sir! Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Stop the attack! G-Gaara... What in the world is he after...? Is he going to leave the village?! <i>My man Sasori must really
be tired of waiting for me by now.</i> <i>Is he going to take him
away alive?!</i> I won't let him get away! Kankuro! Don't be running off carelessly! Wait until we can get
a unit together! We'll lose him if
we just sit around! I'll catch up soon! Don't go after him too far
on your own! Yeah...! I know! <i>That jerk was after Gaara
 from the start?!</i> Lord Kankuro! Don't let him get away,
no matter what! Yes, sir! <i>He landed...?!</i> <i>There should be a unit
securing that area there...</i> My mission is accomplished. You're late... I told you not to keep me waiting! Cut me some slack...
This guy was pretty strong. That's why I told you to make sure
you were prepared. How about the preparations here? Things are all ready here. I had plenty of time, you see... I was fully prepared unlike you. Then, let's get out of here. <i>I'll never be back here again...</i> Hold it! What is it...? It's too quiet... There was a unit securing
the village entrance. There should be quite a commotion
if the enemy landed there... And yet, I don't hear
a single thing! And...I've been sending
several messages, yet there hasn't been
a single response. What the hell's going on here?! L-Lord Kankuro! What is it?! Wh-What's this...?! What a mess... They weren't attacked just now... It might've been before Gaara
started to fight... There were even elite Anbu Black Ops
members here... They must have been attacked at once
by a rather large group? Or perhaps... Perhaps...? No. It's nothing... <i>I made a thorough investigation</i> <i>when Gaara took
 the Kazekage position...</i> <i>No way could there be a traitor
among the Hidden Sand Shinobi!</i> From the looks of this, the guys who took Gaara just
passed straight through here. Hurry! We're going after them! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! There's someone still alive! Stop! Don't move him carelessly... A paper bomb?! It looks like they fell for your trap,
Sasori my man. Of course. Traps are made
to be fallen into. I get it. I'm home! I've come back, now! Whoa! Just as I'd expect, things get pretty dusty when
you leave it for years! Sasuke... I'm back... <i>And I'm here to get you back...</i> It... It can't be...! This means the group that went to get Lord Kazekage
back has been... Don't tell me...
they got Kankuro, too... Get back! It's going to collapse! What's that?! K-Kankuro... I was only able to save
two of them... These guys are hurt! Get them some medical attention! What're you going to do?! Isn't it obvious?! I'm going to get Gaara back! Kankuro...! He was strong enough
to beat Gaara! You don't stand a chance against him! So are you saying we should
just forsake Gaara?! That's not what I'm saying! If we can just find out
where their hideout is, we can form a unit later
and attack! <i>I guess I can't stop him, huh...?</i> Listen up! Just follow them... Don't even think about
making a move! Yeah... If I can! <i>That Kankuro...!</i> <i>They're mocking me...</i> Is it Gaara's sand...?! <i>Hang on... Gaara!</i> I leave this to you! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! Deploy a pursuit unit and
have them go after Kankuro immediately! Yes, sir! And contact the Hidden Leaf immediately
regarding this situation! Tell them it's an emergency! Got it?! Yes, sir! <i>I have a bad feeling about this...</i> <i>Something...
Something's about to happen...!</i> I'm counting on you, Takamaru! Go! Lord Kazekage... It'll be fine. I'm sure he'll come back
right away... This way, huh?! <i>Wonderful...</i> <i>I couldn't help reading it
over twice...</i> <i>I guess I should get to bed...</i> <i>Huh...? It's already morning...?</i> Uh-oh... Not good. I still haven't made the unit list
for the new team. Not good, not good at all... Where did I put...
those documents again? All right...! What're you doing up so early...? Everyone's still sleeping,
you know. You...?! I can't leave the village unattended
for too long... My business here is finished, so I just thought I'd head back
as soon as possible... Without even eating breakfast? I'll just find a teahouse or something
along the way and eat there. <i>What're you  doing here?</i> It's a pain, but I'm supposed
to be your guide. I have no choice seeing
as how it's a mission. Must be quite a hassle... Here is fine... The next time we meet, we will be at
the Chunin Exams, huh? Yeah... See you around... It's about time you become
a Jonin. It'll happen before you know it if you stop saying stuff's a pain
and just carry out your missions... What a pain... All right! At last! <i>I don't like this wind...</i> What is it, Sasori my man? I never thought...
someone would be following us. Hold it! I found you...! You will return Gaara to me! Deidara... You go on ahead... <i>As I recall...</i> <i>he was the one who took Gaara
using that strange bird...</i> <i>Then this must be the guy
who set the trap in the village...</i> I'll show you...my puppet show! Crow! Black Ant! Salamander! I'll say it again...
You will give Gaara back to me! You're late! Finally, you're here... Gee, sorry about that... This time it took longer
than I thought to write up the documents
for the new team. Today's our new team's first mission!
Aren't you fired up?! You've always been like that,
Kakashi Sensei! Oh, come on.
You're already annoying! It can't be helped. Kakashi Sensei's always had
that look of disinterest! <i>I'm starting to lose
my dignity here.</i> <i>If I'm not mistaken,
that's one of the Hidden Sand's...</i> Puppet Master Jutsu, huh...? Then I'm going on ahead! You're not going anywhere! Wha--?! I don't like waiting for people, and I don't like
making people wait... I'll finish this right away. With his brother's life at stake,
it looks as though this is a match that the Challenger Kankuro
cannot afford to lose?! <i>Well, he is  one of the finest
Puppet Masters in the Hidden Sand.</i> Meanwhile, the Champion Sasori
has yet to show his skills, making his presence even creepier! Wow, Kankuro made the first move
by bringing out his Crow! And it just went down... However, the challenger still has
an ace known as the Salamander.... Wow, and just as we speak,
there's the Salamander! What sort of trick will it display for us?! Next time:
"Team Kakashi, Deployed"

﻿1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,070
There you go. Where'd this one come from
so early in the morning? Th-This is Takamaru, the fastest
messenger in all the Hidden Sand! Break! What's this...?! It's a level-one emergency message! Contact the Cipher Corps
immediately! It's sure been a long time
since I've been on a mission... I'm so excited! Naruto, accept the mission
without complaint, no matter what we're ordered to do. I know! I hope so... Move it, move it! What was that? Watch it, you! Be more careful! <i>So the Cipher Corps
was summoned, huh...?</i> <i>Then what the bird from earlier
brought must've been...</i> You said there's
a level-one emergency message? Are you sure? Yes. It's right here... It's from the Sand, huh...? Break! That message coming here means... No doubt something's happened
in the Sand! Okay! I'll get right to deciphering it! <i>Team Kakashi, Deployed


</i> Who'd have thought you could keep up
with Crow's speed... It looked like the fly was
about to land, you see. I remember now. This Jinchuriki guy had some siblings. And I heard that one of them
uses Puppets... This is probably that guy... I think his name was Kantaro...
I mean, Kanpachi, or something...? It's Kankuro! <i>I'm telling you I'm  your opponent.</i> And you quit gawking
and get out of here. You're in the way. You're right... I'll be going, then. Hey, hold it! Don't make me repeat myself... <i>I'm  your opponent...</i> It looks like I'll have to take care
of this guy and then go after the other one... <i>You're sure unlucky...</i> <i>My man Sasori just might be
the worst possible opponent for you.</i> There might still be
some traps remaining... Be careful... Preparations for mobilization of
the tracking unit have been completed. All right, go after Kankuro immediately. Even if you find the enemy,
avoid battle as best you can. Our only goal is to find
the enemy hideout. - Yes, sir!
- Yes,sir! We'll send out the Kazekage rescue team
as soon as we find their hideout. You'd better come back
with some information! Get going! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! <i>Kankuro... Make sure you don't do
anything reckless...</i> I'll show you my Puppet Show! There! There! You're pretty good...
However... You didn't notice that
the Black Ant was gone, did you? Here goes! Puppet Show! Puppet Show
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden! The show's over. Whaaat?! A guard for gold bullion
transport convoy?! Huh? You got a problem?! That's totally a C-rank mission! I'll just have to say no thanks
to a mission like that... <i>And here I just told him
not to complain.</i> <i>Please don't act so selfish...</i> <i>I'm the one she's going to get mad at...</i> <i>I knew he'd react like this...
Good grief...</i> <i>Ohh, just as you thought...</i> Naruto, you haven't matured
mentally at all, have you...? Naruto... I gave you an easier mission since
this is more or less a comeback for you... I didn't ask for this! I-I'm sorry, Master! I'll give him
a good scolding later... Y-You moron!
You can talk like that because you don't know
how frightening she can be... Cha! The details of the mission
are written here. Right! Geez, man... The old man Third Hokage
was much more understanding ... Huh? Did you say something?! Hey! Knock it off! Th-There's trouble...Fifth Hokage! What's all the commotion...? We just received an emergency message
from the Sand... The Sand...?! Did you say an emergency message?! This is what we have deciphered... What?! Sand?! A sand clone...? Oh...my god... It can't be... Hey... What happened...? The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand
has been taken by members of the organization
called the Akatsuki. Gaara... Those guys again, huh...? We have more information
concerning the Akatsuki. And so the Hidden Sand has
officially requested our help... Lady Tsunade, don't tell me
you're going to have Team Kakashi...?! This is a time of emergency. I can't be wasting time
on personnel selection. And besides, we've got someone here who's actually fought against
the Akatsuki... I understand that, but... I will now issue Team Kakashi
a new mission. Go to the Village Hidden
in the Sand immediately, find out what's going on and
report back to the Leaf... After that, you will follow the orders
of the Hidden Sand and provide them with back-up! <i>How...?</i> <i>How...?!</i> <i>How can he read
my movements like this...?</i> <i>And on top of that,
he's hardly moved at all the whole time...</i> What's the matter?
Are you already finished...? Like hell I am! Poisoned Mist Inferno... Consecutive Needle Combo! Are you finished? No way... How is he not affected by
being in the Poisoned Mist?! Making people wait any longer than this
goes against my policy... I think it's just about my turn now! Salamander has an iron wall defense... <i>It can withstand a direct hit from
a few thousand tons of rocks...</i> You won't be able to inflict even
a scratch on me. It's safe to say the defensive strength
of that puppet is indeed of the highest level. However... There's always a weakness. It's futile! N-No way... He figured out Salamander's weakness
in one glance...? No matter how strong the puppet may be, the movable parts of the joints
are weaker than the other parts. Now then, shall we go for the finale? <i>I usually don't believe
in stuff like this, but...</i> <i>I've kind of got
a bad feeling about this...</i> <i>How...?</i> <i>How can he read
my hidden weapon attack schemes...?</i> You've got solid talent... However, you picked
the wrong opponent. Your puppets
with the hidden poison weapons... I can see through them all... Crow! Black Ant! Salamander! <i>This is the first time</i> <i>my hidden weapon attacks
have been read like this...</i> You look puzzled... You're wondering how
I figured out your attacks, huh? Of course I did. Crow... Black Ant... Salamander... The one who created these
three puppets is none other...than me! That scroll...?! You idiot! Hurry up and show it to me! What...? The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand
has been... Looks like this isn't the time
to be sleeping like this! I ended up making
someone wait a bit... But I never thought my opponent
would be one of my adorable juniors
using hand-me-downs. I haven't had such a fun fight
in quite some time. Then, you're...the celebrated master
craftsman of the puppet unit, Sasori of the Red Sand?! I'm honored that a kid like you
knows my name. You left the Sand over twenty years ago. What're you doing here?! What's the point of asking such
a thing before you die? <i>My body's getting numb...
Don't tell me he also uses poison...</i> <i>But when?</i> <i>I know! At that moment!</i> The poison's circulating, huh...?
You're finished! You're just going to suffer.
But if you want to live that badly... I won't finish you off! However, that poison will kill you
in less than three days. <i>Gaara...</i> <i>Damn it...!</i> There he is! He's over there! He's collapsed!
And his puppets are smashed... Okay, we're off now! We'll be back, Master. Right... Naruto, good luck! Thanks. Hey! Are you off on a mission now, Naruto? That's right! Oh, more importantly. Tsunade, I've got some information
for you. - The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand...
- I know. I'm just about to send them off
to the Sand now. Right, right. You know about the Akatsuki
and Naruto, don't you...? It's an emergency situation you see... I just made the best choice I could. Oh, come on... Naruto, come here for a second. Hm? Listen up, Naruto.
Don't get reckless against the Akatsuki. They've got business with me. So this time I'll go to them! You have indeed gotten stronger... But if you don't keep cool,
you'll just be asking for trouble. Losing your cool right away
is a bad habit of yours. Naruto... I think you know... But don't use that power. I know... Kakashi... Keep an eye on Naruto and make sure
he doesn't do anything too reckless. I'm counting on you. Okay? Okay. Kakashi Sensei, Sakura,
let's get a move on! H-Hey, wait up! We're off. Oh boy... Are you worried? No, I'm not... He's no longer a weak Shinobi
I need to worry about... And the same goes for Sakura. Growth is sure a mysterious thing. <i>Hang on, Gaara!</i> What's the matter, Kankuro? Actually, my makeup remover
doesn't really agree with my skin. At a time like that, you need
this makeup remover gauze. It's gentle on the skin as
the microfibers help remove the dirt from inside your pores. Ooh, the Kumadori is coming right off. And not only that, if you buy now, you'll get one more for free along
with a handy storage case. Whoa, this is serious.
I'd better hurry right to the Sand shop. Next time:
"The Jinchuriki's Tears"

﻿1
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,230
<i>The Jinchuriki's Tears

  
</i> There's a Paper Bomb left here, too! It's a type that explodes
the instant it's peeled off... We'll just have to detonate it. I see. We're detonating a Paper Bomb! Stop working and take cover! Let's do this. Now isn't the time to be discussing
candidates for a new Kazekage! But if you think about
the worst-case scenario, isn't it important to seize
the initiative? More importantly, the plan to rescue Lord Kazekage
should be the priority! Securing village safety
is what's important! We must not break up
our limited forces in conditions like this. What did you say?! Oh, excuse me... Reporting! An enemy trap has been discovered
in the rubble blocking the entrance. We are currently proceeding
with its detonation... There have been no casualties. However, a portion
of the entrance collapsed due to the effects of the explosion. It seems it will take
an extra half day for repairs! Got it. Arrange it so that those
who are available are dispatched to the repair site immediately. Yes, sir! Hey wait! Thanks to Gaara, the Village Hidden in the Sand was
left almost completely undamaged... But...we paid too great
a price for that... Reporting! All of the bodies of those guarding
the skies have been verified. There is probably little doubt
that the enemy infiltrated the center of the village from the sky... Excuse me! What?! We have been contacted
by the tracking unit. Kankuro was discovered about
half a day out of the village. He is unconscious and
in serious condition. <i>Kankuro...</i> Some members of the tracking unit
have recovered Kankuro and his puppets. They are on their way
back to the village. What about the location
of Lord Kazekage? The remaining members of
the tracking unit are in pursuit. There should be a report soon... You're late, Sasori my man... I thought you didn't like to
keep people waiting. But...I had enough fun
to make up for that. What's up with that? Don't get so touchy. You secured your mission target,
the One-Tail, after all. My mission comes next...
after taking care of this guy. But the one you're after... Yeah, I still don't know where he is... It'd be easier if
he'd just come to me... Yeah...That's right... What kind of Jinchuriki
was he again? Well, worst case scenario,
even if I can't find him... nobody can complain
since we caught one of the Jinchuriki. Gaara, we're coming...! Naruto! I know you're in a hurry,
but don't disrupt the unit! But, but...! Don't lose your cool... Master Jiraiya told you not to,
remember? For crying out loud... Temari! Hurry up and get him
to the operating room! Operating Room Is this...poison?! Prepare an antidote! Gaara... Gaara... What?! Gaara was...?! <i>I was having a bad feeling...</i> It'll take about two and a half days
to get to the Sand from here... Let's hurry. Right. Treatment Room 3 The wounds weren't that serious... The problem is... The poison, huh...? Yes, it's a completely new poison. We have absolutely no idea
how to neutralize it. Gaara...and now Kankuro, too... <i>Taking Naruto is the top-priority duty</i> <i>given to us by our organization,
the Akatsuki.</i> <i>It's not so much you
that they're after...</i> <i>it's what's inside you they want.</i> <i>But as long as you have
the Nine-Tails sealed within you...</i> <i>they might want to have that power
under their own control...</i> Naruto! I told you earlier
not to disrupt the unit... I don't like it! Even I know why they're after
people like Gaara and me... You know it already,
don't you, Sakura...? That I've got... ...the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside me... <i>Hey, it's that kid.</i> <i>Eww, let's get out of here.</i> Gaara and I both...
have monsters inside us... That's what they're after! That's what I don't like! They only see us as monsters! I don't like their selfish way
of viewing us! <i>A monster, huh...?</i> <i>If that's the case,
then we're the same...</i> <i>That's right. I was born a monster.</i> Everything about us...
was the same... And he...fought all by himself
a lot more than me... <i>Naruto...</i> <i>To them, I'm now an artifact
of a past they want to erase.</i> <i>Then why should I exist
and what should I live for?</i> <i>I thought about it,
but couldn't find an answer...</i> <i>But I need that reason while I'm alive...</i> <i>If not, it's the same as dying...</i> The Akatsuki was after him! It's just like me this time, too... And yet, why does he always
have to be the one to get the short end
of the stick?! It's always him! That's why I can't be wasting
any time getting to him! This time, I want to save him
right away! <i>Naruto...</i> <i>Uzumaki...</i> <i>Thank you...</i> You say Kankuro's regained
consciousness? He has, but he's just barely
able to respond to us... His condition has worsened
since yesterday. Baki... Is that you...? Kankuro! It's...it's him... Don't raise your voice! It's not good for you
in your condition! Th-Th Red Sand... I see... So that explains it... Lord Baki...? Oh, Lord Baki. Contact the tracking unit!
Tell them to turn back immediately! Actually, we haven't heard
anything from them since recovering Kankuro yesterday... We were too late... <i>We have no choice
but to consult with them...</i> Huh? What is it? Nothing...
I'm...going out for a bit. Oh, but...! Our superiors told us to give them
a progress report this morning... Do you think I have the time
to be leisurely giving reports?! Action takes precedence
over meetings right now! Y-Yes, sir! This is what happens
as soon as Gaara disappears... Give me a break... <i>I have no choice but to consult
with the honorable siblings...</i> <i>But I wonder...
will they come to our aid willingly?</i> Now, now, the food pills are
only for emergencies... Girls of your age especially need
to be careful not to eat too... She got mad... <i>That's totally sexual harassment...
old man.</i> Naruto. You've met him before, haven't you? Itachi Uchiha... And he's after you. I didn't just train over these past
two and a half years. I got into Master Tsunade's library and did outside investigations
the best I could. And now... what was bothering me
finally makes sense now! <i>I wouldn't call it a dream,
but I've got an ambition!</i> <i>To restore the clan and
to kill a certain man...no matter what!</i> <i>I'm the only one who can kill him.</i> <i>I'm an avenger.</i> <i>I have to become stronger
than him...</i> <i>I don't have time to be getting
tripped up in a place like this.</i> The person Sasuke wants to kill... is his own older brother
Itachi Uchiha, right...? A member of the Akatsuki! <i>Itachi...Uchiha!</i> <i>Itachi...Uchiha?</i> <i>I'm going to kill you!</i> <i>Just as you told me to do,</i> <i>I've resented you, hated you, and...</i> <i>I've lived...</i> <i>I've lived...</i> <i>only to kill you!</i> <i>Sure enough, you're brothers...</i> <i>I see power greater than Itachi's hidden
in those eyes of yours...</i> <i>Sasuke will definitely seek me out...</i> <i>in search of power...</i> That's why Sasuke is with Orochimaru
in an attempt to obtain power... But Orochimaru is
after Sasuke's body, right? And we only have six months left! <i>Sakura knows about that too...</i> And Orochimaru used to be
a member of the Akatsuki. Basically this is what I want...to say. The closer we get to the Akatsuki, the closer we get to information
about Orochimaru... If that happens... we'll eventually get closer to Sasuke! <i>And after that, Itachi Uchiha...</i> <i>Our worst enemy who
plagued Sasuke for so long...</i> <i>and the one who's after Naruto...</i> <i>This time I'll  save the two of them!</i> It appears someone's come... Say, Big Sister... Hey, Big Sister...! Are you dead? Gotcha! I was playing dead. Cut it out. That senility act's
too real, Big Sister... Honored siblings... I have come to request
your assistance. Old books are supposed
to be tied in a bundle and left up on a high shelf... What can we possibly do now...? An organization called the Akatsuki
has taken the Shukaku. If we leave things as they stand now,
there will be great trouble. It's your generation now.
You guys deal with it yourselves. You two have powerful connections
with each land, including villages in lands
we are not allied with... There's only so much information
we can gather on our own... We've long since been retired. We no longer have
any attachments to the world. Although I guess it'd be nice
to see my grandchild's face one more time... That's very convenient. Your grandson is a member
of the Akatsuki. Granny Chiyo... In this season of
cherry blossoms blooming... It's the biggest opportunity
of the year! - We're doing it again this year...

"Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons"

﻿1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,270
Who're they? Oh, that's... Granny Chiyo...and Ebizo. No way. I thought they were supposed
to have long since been retired. Treatment Room 3 Oh, we have been expecting you. Please enter. I think you all know who
these people are. This is Lady Chiyo and Lord Ebizo. - Hello.
- Welcome. Hm? If I'm not mistaken, this is... It's Kankuro. The current Kazekage's older brother. Oh, that's right. You checked his blood, right? Y-Yes. Please look at this. I've never seen...
composition like this before. Yes. We believe it might be
a new type of poison. Have you tried an antidote? For the time being,
we tried using what we had. But none had any identifiable effects. I see... Ordinarily, he would just finish the job... It appears he's very confident
about his poison. Leaving his prey as is
on purpose is just like Sasori. Finally we're out of the Sand. I hate making people wait...
Let's hurry. Good grief. Whose fault was it
that it took this long? That goes for both of us. Oh yeah. <i>Sealing Jutsu:
Nine Phantom Dragons


</i> All right. This one didn't work, either. You haven't tried anything else? For the time being, we have requested the Leaf for
a specialist team to be dispatched. It would be best to wait for their arrival. Talk about depending on others. This happened because you depend
on alliances with other lands and conduct nothing
but slipshod education. It is not...our intention to
depend on others. I guess it can't be helped... It's his fault for losing his cool
and pursuing too far. A Shinobi is the last person
who should do that ... What's the point of trusting
and being totally dependent on the likes of the Leaf? Improving the strength of your own village
should be your top priority. They are them, we are us. Listen. An amicable alliance is nothing
but a pipe dream. At times like this,
the most we can expect is for them to send us some
useless underlings for form's sake. That would never happen... That's how it goes. Everyone looks out for themselves. Okay, break's over. Huh? Kakashi Sensei, where's Naruto? Up there. <i>One more day until
we get to the Sand.</i> We have to hurry. Okay, let's get going. This is not good. Poisons are my specialty,
but even I can't figure this out. Even you, Lady Chiyo...? At best, he has one day... He may not even make it
to dawn tomorrow, I'd say. That Sasori has sure grown considerably. What in the world should we do? Well, the only one who might
know more about antidotes than me would be
the Leaf's slug princess, Tsunade. I had a lot of trouble with her
during the great war. She would decipher all the poisons
I created and concoct antidotes. And now we're allies with the Leaf. All we can do is send for her and
have her look at Kankuro. But she is now the Hokage and would not be able to
leave her village so easily. And even if she were to come, it takes three days to get here
from the Leaf. I know. Nobody's seriously thinking
of summoning her. I don't like that slug girl, anyway. Are you okay, Lady Tsunade? Yeah. There's a cold going around,
so please take care. Thanks. <i>It's been two days
since Team Kakashi left.</i> <i>They should be arriving
tomorrow morning.</i> This is a bad sign. Don't tell me...! <i>Group 3, 117037... I knew it.</i> <i>I won. And first prize at that.</i> <i>This is really a bad omen.</i> Shizune. Are you there, Shizune? All right! It's the desert! The Village Hidden in the Sand
is up ahead. I'll take the lead from here. We're counting on you. We're here. Let's go. <i>You're late. Prepare immediately.</i> The Jinchuriki was unexpectedly strong. <i>All right, gather.</i> <i>Now, let us begin.</i> We will soon be done removing the traps
and rocks from the road. Good work. We are currently working on
gathering the bodies. But there is one thing that is
a matter of concern. What is it? We have not yet found Captain Yura. What? It is clear that the Captain was
heading for the road before the incident. We have not even found
a scrap of his clothing, let alone his body. That's strange. He's either slipped past the enemy
and is in pursuit, or perhaps nobody noticed
that he was killed. I'd like to send backup for him
if he's still alive. But if we don't know where he is... Did you call me, Lady Tsunade? Yes... I want to send reinforcements to
the Village Hidden in the Sand. Reinforcements? They should be about done
with their previous mission and on their way back by now. Them? Oh. Yes, ma'am. I'll make
the preparations immediately. Can the worst-case scenario
be considered? <i>From now, it will take three days
and three nights.</i> <i>Keep your attention to
your real body as well.</i> <i>And Zetsu, you keep watch on the outside
with the body for the time being.</i> <i>Use the longest range.</i> <i>I know.</i> <i>Three days?</i> <i>Shouldn't we consider that it might
take a bit longer</i> <i>since we don't have Orochimaru?</i> <i>If that's what you think,
then get right to it.</i> <i>That's true.</i> <i>Indeed.</i> That sounds good. Spirit Blue White Red Boar South North Three Sphere <i>Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons.</i> Lady Tsunade. They have returned from their mission! All right. Oh, just a minute, Lady Tsunade. I'm giving you guys
an S-rank mission! - Huh?
- No way. S-rank? - Mission?
- Don't tell me... All right! We got an S-rank mission! I can't believe it... Our ability has finally
been acknowledged! I-It can't be! Are you okay, Ebisu Sensei? Well, I spent a bit too long soaking
in the hot spring, you see. More like you were peeping. Here this is the first S-rank mission
for us since we became Ninja. Don't be catching a cold,
you closet pervert! What's with these guys? This is the wrong room, Lady Tsunade.
They're over here. Geez, how confusing. What about our S-rank mission? It was a misunderstanding...
Thank goodness. I'm giving you guys the same mission
as Team Kakashi. Head for the Sand and
complete the mission by providing backup for Kakashi
and the others. Got it?! Yes, ma'am! Please leave it to us. Roger. Understood. All right! Team Guy heading into action. You catch a cold? No, my hay fever started
acting up before... All right, we'll make it to
the Sand in one day. Sensei, let's make it in half a day. It'll take three days, no matter
how you consider it. Please stop your conversations
with that carried-away mood... All right, we're leaving! Together with me, everyone.
The dash of youth! Yes, Guy Sensei! How embarrassing. Give it up, Tenten. They're as energetic as ever. It's sure been awhile
since we've seen Naruto. I'm looking forward to seeing
how much he's grown. Yeah. Here we're so close to
the Village Hidden in the Sand... I can't just sit around waiting! Naruto, I told you not to
lose your patience. But...! Be patient. Right now, Temari is
the one who's the most anxious. The ironclad rule is to
stay put right there if you encounter a sandstorm. You lose your sense of direction
in a sandstorm. We often hear of people dying of dehydration after
getting lost in the desert. It'll be okay. A sandstorm around this time
of year shouldn't last too long. Please let up soon. Kankuro... Give him a sedative. Okay. All we can do now is ease his pain... Our only ray of hope is the Leaf Shinobi
who are scheduled to arrive tomorrow. If they have a poison specialist
with them... If Kankuro can hold on
that long, of course. The road from the Leaf is currently
impassable due to a sandstorm. In the worst case,
they could arrive several days late. If that happens,
then it's hopeless. This is pathetic... I can't believe the day has come when
we have to rely on the aid of the Leaf. Aren't you tired, Big Sister?
Let's have a seat outside. You haven't had a wink of
sleep since yesterday, right? It's so sad,
having to depend on the Leaf... Big Sister. She fell asleep, huh? If they're early, the help from the Leaf
should be arriving pretty soon. But even a local wouldn't be
able to get here quickly with yesterday's sandstorm. Hey, what's that? Oh! We've been expecting you. So you were with them, Temari? Please, come this way. What?! They got Kankuro, too? Yes, Lord Kazekage was taken and
Kankuro followed in pursuit. Kankuro was poisoned by the enemy
and we don't know how to neutralize it. At this rate... he won't... Damn it! Let's hurry, Temari. I'll take a look at him. Treatment Room 3 Kankuro! Kankuro! <i>He's...the White Fang of the Leaf!</i> <i>You jerk!</i> Huh? Prepare yourself! Medical Emergency 24 hours. Today we're reporting live from
the Hidden Sand Medical Facility. It appears that a new patient
has been brought in just now. The patient is a 17-year-old Jonin,
poisoned, and in critical condition. Oh, his Kumadori make up
is being washed off! The surgeon seems to be a girl. Can such a young doctor handle this? It looks like the toxin is
being sucked out...however! Despite their medical efforts, it appears they have just
lost the patient. Hey, don't kill me off just like that! Next time: "The Medical Ninja's Student" What an impressive Tailed Beast. The ordinary method
doesn't work, after all. Well, it doesn't matter...
I'll just move on to the next step. Inside the Mist

 Hey, are you all right? Yeah...more or less. It doesn't seem like
the Leaf Ninja are nearby. But I can't figure out the situation. Say, what was that huge wave just now? And I heard a cry of some sort... Just what are Guren
and the others doing...? It's probably better for us
if we don't know. Oh, Gozu... You're alive. Yeah... Where's Guren? I dunno. You should be able to find her! We'd like nothing better,
but suddenly the bats stopped responding. Frankly, I'm stumped. Where do you think you're going? She may be injured... Hey, finding her is...
Hey Gozu! Oh, man. He's got a crush on her. Owww... Damn it! I was put through hell. How far down did I wash away? I know! Him...? What was he doing with
Orochimaru's ally? Now listen, follow that person! Don't let that person go! Uh-huh...! That kid...
Could it have been my fault...?! Damn it! This fog...! Where am I? Sasuke?! Don't interfere. Why you--! What're you gonna do with Sasuke?! I'm going to begin
the Reanimation Jutsu. What...?! That is his wish. He will attain power...
And I will attain him. As if I'd let you! We're gonna take Sasuke
back to our village! How silly.
He doesn't desire such a thing. Still, home is where people
think of you. I believe that... I wonder if that's true... Shut up...! You...will regret it. Shut up! Stop! Naruto! Phew... That was close. Kakashi Sensei...?! Look, we finally found you.
What do you think you're doing?! Huh?! But Orochimaru was right here... Huh? I don't pick up any scents. It seems...that was an illusion. Huh...? But... Are you all right, Naruto? We've assembled everyone. But it doesn't mean
our problems are over. Hmm? Look... This is...?! They have started to act weird. Their sense of direction is shot.
We can't use them for reconnaissance. Hey, hey, are you serious...? It started after the fog became thicker. On our side, Naruto saw an illusion. It seems this is no ordinary fog. Naruto... What happened at that lake? Huh? There was...this giant rampaging turtle. Those guys we fought earlier
were fighting it. Hmm? What...? A turtle...?! Hey... are you saying that
giant Chakra was actually a turtle? Shut up! I'm telling the truth! Anyway, the turtle caused
that giant wave! Gamakichi saw that thing and
said it was a Three-Tails... Three-Tails...?!
A Tailed Beast appeared here? Probably... Although it's not like
he saw how many tails he had... Senpai... Just when I thought we figured out
their target... We've come across
another puzzling thing... In any case, we must retreat to
somewhere this fog can't reach us. We'll go through all our data
and plan our next strategy. Why didn't you kill him? What was that just now...? Guren... Yuukimaru...? I see... I fought with a Three-Tails
and lost consciousness. I never imagined that the Three-Tails
would have such power... That raging current probably
swallowed up the rest. If the Hidden Leaf are on the move, I want to join up with Rinji
and the others, but in this fog... What happened to the Three-Tails? I don't know...
It suddenly got quiet... I see... But I'm glad. That you woke up... You were moaning the whole time... You wouldn't wake up, no matter how many times
I called out your name... I get it... He stayed by me
the whole time I was unconscious... Now then. Shall we go find the others? Uh-huh. But I wonder... What? It's sorta strange.
I don't have any strength in my body... You have a fever again!
Since when...? Byakugan! Oh! Amazing...! Did you see something? Yes. Let's go back. All right... How did it go? Yes... That is surely no ordinary fog. There's quite a bit of Chakra
inside it. Furthermore, it has totally
enveloped the lake. It's a considerable amount of Chakra. I guess we're right to conclude that
the fog was produced by the Three-Tails. Yes... According to what Naruto said, that fog has the power to
make you hallucinate. It's like a kind of barrier. It's dangerous to approach the lake. That's bad!
He's still inside there...! He...? Remember Sakura, I told you before.
I met him on the way here. Oh, that's right... Oh, when you were delirious... Quit being so rude!
Anyway, he's still on the lake! Inside the fog...! The lake? Please, Kakashi Sensei!
He's not a Ninja! I have to find out if he's okay... Sorry, Naruto. I can't allow it... Kakashi Sensei! Earlier, you were ensnared
by the Three-Tails' illusion and almost ended up killing
your comrade. Acting on your own
is out of the question. I...I know that, but... But Kakashi Sensei...
The problem is... what'll we do now? Whatever has developed, we've fallen far off track from
searching for Orochimaru's hideout. Well, the situation has gotten too big
for me to make arbitrary decisions. And so, I've already sent Pakkun
back to Hidden Leaf Village. We'll wait here until we get orders
from Lady Tsunade. In the meantime, stay outside
the perimeter of the fog and keep an eye on
the Three-Tails and those others. Understood? - Yes!
- Yes! That's the gist of it. I had heard that the Three-Tails
disappeared after the last Great War. But to have it reappear in this form... Orochimaru has gotten involved
in something troubling. But the Akatsuki are desperately
searching for Tailed Beasts. Perhaps the fact that we discovered it
first is a blessing in disguise. Yes... But if the Akatsuki get wind of this, it's certain to turn into tug-of-war
for the Three-Tails. We cannot hand it over to anyone. You'll capture it then? I don't think it will be easy... However, there must be
some kind of precedent... I'm going to look it up in
our existing documents. I want you to summon
the members I've written there. Understood! All done... Thank you for your help today. Really...?! Yes... Please keep up the good work. Yes! I can't go on... We're just beginning, Tenten.
The real challenge begins now! Well said, Lee! Words of weakness in the midst
of your youth are forbidden, Tenten! Right! To be mutually aware of one's partner
and to watch each other's back! To hone one's skills in Taijutsu
to form an unbeatable combination. Let us do that! And trying to keep up with
all your showboating is wearing me out! Hmm?! Lee, what is the purpose
of this training? Huh? Coordination with one's partners.
It's training to build up synergy! Correct! However, do you think you are
in harmony with Tenten right now? She's breathing hard... Oh no! I understand, Sensei. It seems my feelings have
gotten ahead of hers. That's my student!
You catch on quickly! Cripes, we've been at this nonstop
for five hours. No matter how many bodies I have,
I can't hold up. I still have a lot left in me! Well said, Lee! As soon as Tenten has caught her breath,
we'll resume training! I'm going to perform a Taijutsu attack
without holding back, so counter me with all your might! Right, Guy Sensei! We're going to continue anyway...? Wait, look...! We're being called up? All right.
We'll continue after you get back! Go, you two! Show them the results
of your long, arduous training! - Right!
- Yes! And that's the gist of the situation. You will go to support Kakashi
and the others who have gone ahead of you. You are probably aware by now that the most critical thing is
to seal the Three-Tails. Sealing the Three-Tails will require
extremely delicate Chakra control. Medical Ninja consisting
of myself and Ino; plus Sakura and Hinata,
who are already there, will form the Sealing unit. Right! I'll do my best! Lee and Tenten, I need you to fill the gap
that Hinata and Sakura will be leaving. As long as the enemy is after
the Three-Tails, confrontation will be inevitable. You can count on us! We'll fight with the full power
of our youth! I will lead you to the site.
Don't lag behind! Geez, it won't do if you collapse
from nursing the sick. This is my second time
taking care of him... If you give him that much medicine... Could those pills be the cause...? In any case, I must avoid a battle
with the enemy while I have him. Hey, Yuukimaru. Wake up. You know...
The place I can return to...is by you. Huh? I finally...found it. We're supposed to be on watch
until the next shift. That Naruto! Don't slack off. Huh? Sakura... I've been thinking... Huh? But I can't find an answer by myself. Back then, when I was training...
the Pervy Sage said something to me. Jiraiya? "Wherever someone thinks of you,
that's where home is." That's a nice saying. But...is that really true? If that's true, then if we keep
thinking about someone, that person would return, right? Yes... I'd like to think that. But no matter how much
we think of someone, there are some who won't return. It's a very difficult thing...
to have your thoughts reach someone. Yet, if you give up...and there's no one
to think about that person... That's sad. Yes. If we give up, then there really
won't be a place to return to. Yes! No matter what anyone says,
we just have to keep thinking of him... and create a place where
he can return freely at any time. Sakura! Okay? You're right.
We just can't give up. Right! I feel much better,
thanks to you, Sakura! I'm going back to my position. In thirty minutes,
the next two-man team will relieve us. So stay alert. Thank you! Sakura... She's right... So if someone is thinking about me,
then that's the place I go back to? Yup... No matter what anyone says,
just keep thinking about him. But...if he really has no place to go... I'll be the one he can come home to. Sakura, I'm here to relieve you.

 Right. So far,
there's been nothing unusual.

 Um... Excuse me ...

 What's wrong, Sai?
Your position is over there.

 Well, I don't see Naruto.

 What?! Did that guy go back without
having anybody take over his position?!

 If so, we would've crossed paths...

 We're talking Naruto here.
He may just be sleeping somewhere.

 No way... That Naruto...

 Next time:
"Everyone's Feelings"

 Tune in again

 Are we getting close
to our destination? At this rate, we'll get there
around noon tomorrow. Stop asking me the same question
every five minutes! Lee, don't be so antsy! What are you saying?! Our comrades
are anxiously waiting for us! Our mission is to move at full speed
and get there as soon as possible! You waste so much energy... Shizune Senpai... Hmm? If the enemy has made contact
with the Three-Tails... That means they have a Jutsu to take the Three-Tails
into their possession, right? Yes. Probably a Sealing Jutsu,
or some Jutsu we don't know about. Once we get there, we'll have to use
our Sealing Jutsu immediately. We can't have them beat us to it. Then it's decided! Let's pick up our pace to twice,
no, three times the speed! Not that nonsense again... But I fully agree.
Pakkun, lead the way! Seems I have no choice.
Everyone, don't fall behind! Well, that's about it. What do you think, Senpai? Yeah, looks good. You haven't turned a page in a while.
Is something on your mind? Hmm? Oh, this and that... Yamato, how do you think those guys
intended to capture the Three-Tails? Well, it's a Tailed Beast, after all... Our opponent's Crystal Style
is powerful, but I doubt that it's enough
to suppress the Tailed Beast... Which means they must use
another measure concurrently. But back then, we weren't restrained
for very long. I can't believe that they were able to prepare for such
an elaborate formula in that time. That's true... But didn't Naruto say he saw
a child by the lake? That bothers me... On top of that, we'll be facing
that Crystal Style user very soon... Where are you going? Let's analyze the situation and
do whatever we can now. Kakashi Sensei... Let me interrupt for a little.
Hey, I want to discuss something. Okay... Everyone's Feelings

 Umm...you're the one I come back to. Come back to...huh...? I wonder where he went. He's from the Hidden Leaf... It'll be a bother if he gets any closer. Don't move from this spot. I'm here to relieve you. Right. So far, there's been
nothing unusual. - Um... Sakura...
- Huh? - Sai?
- Hey! This isn't your position. Oh, I know that, but... Do you know where Naruto is? Huh? Isn't he in his assigned spot? Well, I don't see him. That guy, did he go back early? If so, we would've crossed paths... That's right. Even Naruto would
wait to be relieved of duty...! No way... If that wave took him,
there wouldn't be any trace left... Who are you?! You should be grateful!
I came just for you. You're... Lurking around all by yourself... If your purpose was to spy,
you came across the worst opponent. It seems this is no illusion... Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Blade! Die! I'm not spying! I'm searching! For that kid who was with you! Answer me! Where is he?! Guren...? I...have to go. What?! Naruto has disappeared? What is the possibility that
he came under attack? I didn't pick up
any suspicious scents at the site. I think he just took off on his own. He seemed to have something
on his mind... But to go off like this... Naruto... Geez... In any case, we have
to find Naruto at once. Then we all... No, like I said before... It's dangerous to go
into the fog recklessly. Yamato and I will search for him. Summoning Jutsu! It's very rare for you to summon me. Pakkun is out on a mission, so Biscuit,
I need you to find Naruto right away. Gotcha. Shino, Kiba and Hinata
search outside the mist. Sakura and Sai will do
aerial reconnaissance. - Yes!
- Yes! Do not act alone. Where is the little kid?
Is he okay?! This guy...
Why's he asking about Yuukimaru...? I see... He was watching that... Well, it's none of your business! It is my business! So petty! Tell me! I need to take him back! Are you crazy? Take him back?
He was on our side from the beginning. No! It's my fault that
he went over to your side! All because of the unnecessary stuff
I said to him... Unnecessary? Thank you.
You taught me, didn't you? Y-You... Yuukimaru... Wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you go home to... Hey, don't move! I'm really grateful. I finally found the place
where I can go back to. Right, Guren? Sorry. Yuukimaru! Don't move! So you were hiding one
of your Shadow Clones. Guren! So your name is Yuukimaru? I'm Naruto. Naruto... Yuukimaru, you're going home
with me to Hidden Leaf Village. Why? She's not the one you're going home to! She serves Orochimaru. And this guy Orochimaru will
do anything to achieve his ambition. He's a bastard who thinks
nothing of taking peoples' lives. Anyone who serves a guy like
that can't be a decent human being! Guren will protect me... She's kind to me and she thinks of me... It's obvious she's just using you! Shut up! This kid won't return to your place! Guren... Something's coming... The Hidden Leaf... I'm taking him by force, if necessary! Hexagonal Crystal Shuriken:
Wild Dance! What?! Take this! I won't let you get away! Naruto, stop! Stabilized and secured. Let me go! I'm taking him...! It's no use. They've disappeared. Damn it... She serves Orochimaru. He's a bastard who thinks
nothing of taking peoples' lives. Guren, are you hurt? Don't bother me! She's not the one you're going home to. That kid... When I see him again... I'm sorry... But... I'm glad you're all right. Yuukimaru! I'm going back. Right. Thanks. What's with you? Surely, you knew that if
you went off on your own, you were bound to encounter
that Crystal Style user? I know. But I... I just had to find him... Don't make excuses. You're lucky; you could've
been dead by now. You put your comrades in danger
because you gave in to your emotions. How can you face Lady Tsunade, who put her trust in you and
sent you on this mission? Okay, I was wrong. This mission involves a dangerous,
unpredictable foe. Recklessly acting on your own
could spell death for everyone. Don't let yourself forget that. Yeah. Shall we return? Yes. By the way, Naruto,
you said you saw a child at the lake. Huh? What about it? Something's been bothering me.
Tell me the details of that incident. Guren! I'm glad you're okay. Sorry. But I couldn't use my search net
near the lake. Forget it... It seems we haven't
lost any fighting strength... Although, there's at least one
I would've preferred to lose. So I'm blessed with the luck of evil.
It's mutual. He's weakened, but it's tolerable. He's exhausted. Let him rest. Unfortunately... I don't think we can afford to
hang around here. I just can't imagine why those guys
would take an ordinary kid along, when they face a huge challenge
in snaring the Three-Tails. He's no ordinary kid, I tell you... What if he possesses some
special power against the Three-Tails? Now that you mention it... He did something and... it seemed as though
the Three-Tails stopped moving. It figures... You mean a human was
controlling a Tailed Beast? I don't know what trick they used,
but we're dealing with Orochimaru... It's probably no mistake that they intend to use a child
to capture the Three-Tails. Which means, this child...
We can't just ignore him. What do you mean by that? We wait for an opportunity,
and then we take him. Take him? As long as they don't have the boy, they have no method to
capture the Three-Tails. And I can't believe that Orochimaru will be satisfied with
just capturing Three-Tails... Sooner or later, he'll think of ways to create
a Jinchuriki that is easy to control. For him, a boy with the ability
to synergize with a Tailed Beast is merely a useful tool. I won't let him do that! You're absolutely right. Besides, I'm sure they would want
to examine his powers back at the village. Well, it all depends
on Lady Tsunade's reply. Naruto! Sakura! This is...the loving smack? This is far more effective
than us trying to lecture him. Kakashi Sensei,
I gave Naruto an earful. Was he sorry? I'm so...sorry... Never mind that.
There's good news! Reinforcements from the Hidden Leaf? Our foes respond very quickly. No doubt, they will try to seal
the Three-Tails. No way! The Three-Tails belongs
to Lord Orochimaru. Of course!
And that is why, this time, Guren... You must use Yuukimaru
to suppress the Three-Tails. But Yuukimaru is still... Don't worry. If we build up his stamina
and allow him to rest a bit, we'll be able to use him. He's going to give him that drug again... But Yuukimaru still looks awfully weak. If you force him...
Are you sure he'll be all right? Well, I wonder... Don't look at me like that. You should know that Yuukimaru
is simply a tool to capture the Three-Tails. Unless we make use of him now, there's no meaning in
his very existence. But if he collapses and the plan fails... My credibility will be totally ruined! Guren, I'm hoping that
the plan is a success. That's why I... Well, it's irritating. You tend to stick your nose into
other people's business too often. Guren... You... The main thing is to prevent the Hidden Leaf from sealing
the Three-Tails, right? Well then, I'll destroy the Leaf! Had an argument? I've never liked that four-eyed jerk! Does he want to kill Yuukimaru? Oh... What? It's unlike you to worry
so much about Yuukimaru. Don't be ridiculous.
I'm just concerned about our mission. Concerned about the mission, eh...? Reinforcements are here? Who? Just wait and see. I've had it... I can't run any further. Sakura, who's come to help...? You're so reckless, Naruto! It's okay! Recklessness and youth
go hand in hand! Stop affirming his actions! Hey! You guys...! Let me go over Lady Tsunade's orders. Our new mission is to seal
the Tailed Beast, the Three-Tails. And, to protect the child
from the enemy. He seems to be connected
in some way to this Tailed Beast! With the mission change,
you'll be divided into the following teams. Sealing team, Guarding team
and the Crystal User Counter team. Got it. And, how will we team up for this? Yeah, about that... I have an idea. Next time: "Regroup!"

 Kakashi, I'm back now. Oh, thanks. "Oh thanks"? Can't you put
more appreciation into your reply? In addition to my appreciation,
could you deliver another message? Hey! Can't you be more kind to me?! Kakashi...Sensei. If you don't mind, you can also use my
"Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll." Huh?! Information drawn by my ink
will change into small animals, protect themselves,
and deliver messages outside. Oh, that's handy.
Then let's get to it. - Wait a minute!
- Huh? You can't trust scribble like that! I'll show you what
Ninja Hounds are made of! I won't let an ink bird
take my chance to show off! Oh no. He's off... Did I do something wrong? No. It's for the best. Huh? Oh no! MAKE-OUT PARADISE
BEST QUOTE COLLECTION
   
I gave him the wrong scroll! Tune in again!

 Oh! I'm glad you're here,
Bushy Brow! Everyone! Now that I'm here,
you have nothing to fear! Hey! It's "we're here." You are too eager. Well, you can relax. You're as confident as always, but have you mastered
the ABCs of Medical Ninjutsu? What?! For someone who started
Medical Ninjutsu just a tad before me, you sound pretty confident yourself. Well sure. It's not as though
I started yesterday. Well, you need that handicap. After all, we're not equals,
Billboard Brow. I haven't been called that
in a while... Ino Pig! What?! So their nicknames are
Billboard Brow and Ino Pig...? Huh? What...did...I...? Lady Tsunade briefed us on the basics. But can you give us the specifics
of the situation? Well, there's a new development... - What's with him?
- Let's do our best! What did I do? What were you writing?
Let's see it. Yes... We'll explain over there. There are four Shinobi who can
move freely inside a smoke screen. Also, the big guy I fought,
and then there's a Crystal Style user... They were in the lake dealing
with a Tailed Beast which we believe is a Three-Tails. Hmm... That was included
in our information. Well, we'd better get started quickly
so we can seal it. If the enemy takes possession of
the Three-Tails' fighting power, we're in trouble. There's one more thing...
a new development. Huh?! Naruto witnessed a child
at the lake. And he says that child
controls the Tailed Beast. No way... Someone who can
control a Tailed Beast...? Furthermore, Naruto later encountered
the child with the Crystal Style user. What's their relationship? It seems they're quite close... Naruto says, "the Crystal Style user is
the place where the child can return to." Just who is this child? The Three-Tails doesn't have
a Jinchuriki... Not yet...
After all, we're dealing with Orochimaru. Maybe he's aiming to make
that child a Jinchuriki. It seems we have yet another
troubling thing to deal with. Regroup!

 We knew we had to deal
with human foes, but no one said a thing about
a Tailed Beast! No kidding. That thing caused
a huge flood just by appearing. What the hell are they starting? But it's too late for us to run away. Say, think of a way we can get out of this. We were lucky to make it
out of that camp alive. I'm not about to give my life
to some damned beast! We're counting on you, Rinji. Just how simple are
these guys anyway? Look, I'll work things out.
Leave the rest to me. Just as I expected, Rinji! Where are you going? If you're going to report to Guren,
I'll go. I can't trust you... Well, how you feel is up to you. Do you intend to betray Guren? Whether I forgive you or not
depends on your answer... Contrary to what you believe,
my loyalties are with Guren. I wonder...about that... This is just between you and me... Why do you think I'm here? I left a sickly kid sister back
in the village... In order to protect her, I need money. That's why...
I can't afford to lose my life here. What you make of my story
is totally up to you. Oh? You're up? Where's Guren? Oh... How about it?
Want to go back to Lord Orochimaru? Will Guren come with us? Guren...? She's just a sacrifice
to Lord Orochimaru... Huh?! Don't forget...
You belong to Lord Orochmaru. No! The place I return to...
is the place where Guren is--! Move away from Yuukimaru! Guren! What do you intend to do to him?! I'm...just disciplining him a bit. I'm the one who's gonna be
in trouble with Lord Orochimaru if anything should happen
to Yuukimaru. I mustn't disappoint him. He wasn't able to even talk properly. I'm amazed at how much
you've taught him. If you ever lay a hand on Yuukimaru again,
I'll show you no mercy. Humph! Well then...
Keep a good eye on our test subject. Are you all right? Uh-huh! I'm going to stay
with you, right? Guren... I don't want to go back
to the hideout. Rinji...? Can you believe that? She was so hung up on
Lord Orochimaru and now it's the kid... I hope it doesn't interfere
with her mission... I'm worried that she's getting
a bit too attached to him. Well, we'll just leave her
to Lord Orochimaru. I want you to continue
to watch her closely... and make sure she's not up to anything. Continue... eh? I'd be happy to be the one reporting
to Lord Orochimaru... You? I've done many things for you
as your spy. I posed as a convict at that prison and
got accepted by those reconstructed men and sent you reports.
That was dangerous work. Even this job... It's because I'm putting my life
at risk like this... that you're able to get
the data you want. What are you trying to say? It's simple. I want you to value me
a little bit more. You want to cut a deal? No such thing... I've never considered myself
to be your subordinate. I serve Lord Orochimaru. Oh... I just want Lord Orochimaru himself
to recognize my efforts. At least here, in this location, I'm the one who can get Kigiri, Kihou
and Nurari to act. I have more fighting power than you. I mean, if you're the one who's killed
by the Hidden Leaf first, I can rush to Lord Orochimaru
and report it to him. All right, I'll let you see him. But if you don't keep
your expectations realistic, you'll end up being destroyed... Now listen. It's going to get noisy
outside for a bit. Just be a good boy and wait here. What about you, Guren? As soon as I take care of some business,
I will come back. I promise. All you need to think about
is resting your body. I'm okay. I feel a little better. No, not yet.
You need to heal completely. Umm... I want to ask you for a favor... Can you...fix this? I see... Rather than fixing this,
I'll make you a better one. But... What's the matter? I want to keep this one.
This is the first flower you gave me... Oh right... Here, it's fixed. Thank you. Umm, you won't go anywhere, right? Huh...? The place I return to is with you... This is stupid... Just what...am I doing? Naruto... Kakashi Sensei... What's the matter?
What's on your mind? That guy!
The strategy meeting has begun. What's keeping him?! She's always upset when
it comes to Naruto... Huh...? What's the matter?
Did you find Naruto? What do you plan on doing
with that kid? Why're you so worried about him? He's being used! He believes there's someone
he can return to... But he's sure to be betrayed. When that happens... He won't have anywhere to go. If wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you return to... Then...I'll keep thinking of him. Then he wasn't talking about Sasuke... It may be important to think
about people. But I wonder if things always
go that smoothly? After all, everyone has
different thoughts and feelings. That's not true.
Feelings always get through to others! Naruto... Let me go over Lady Tsunade's orders regarding strategy and a change
in team formation. The search-and-aid mission
to Orochimaru's hideout is now over. Sakura, Hinata and Ino...
you will be under my command. - Yes.
- Yes. Yes. Kakashi will lead the rest. Right. Our new mission is to seal
the Tailed Beast, the Three-Tails. And, to protect the child from the enemy. He seems to be connected in
some way to this Tailed Beast. Huh?! It is not just the Akatsuki who
covet the Tailed Beast. If it becomes known that there is
a Tailed Beast that has no Jinchuriki, other nations are bound to join the hunt. So that boy was brought here to turn him
into a Jinchuriki? Right, Naruto? - Huh?
- Sai! Huh? Oh right...
You're a Jinchuriki too, Naruto. Humph! You always say things without thinking. Still, you're right about what you said. Sealing the Three-Tails
and protecting that kid... That's so he doesn't end up
like Gaara and me, right, Shizune? Yes... that's right. Our goal is not to capture
the Tailed Beast. Even if we seal the Beast, we will make it disappear into
a space where no one else can touch it. That is Lady Tsunade's...
the Hokage's will. All right! Let's do it! But...the Tailed Beast has
a huge mass of Chakra, right? I don't see how we can put a seal on it. Yes. It will take an extremely
delicate amount of Chakra control and concentration. Sakura and Ino... Both of you are training
in Medical Ninjutsu. Your experience will be very useful. And Hinata... Umm, I have no experience
in Medical Ninjutsu. What's important is your ability
to control Chakra. You may not know Medical Ninjutsu,
but your mastery of the Gentle Fist and your Byakugan, which can
see the flow of Chakra, will be useful. You will be fine. Hinata, you're amazing! N-No such thing... I understand. I guess girls are better at
delicate Chakra control. Yup, yup... Huh? But Tenten... How come she hasn't been chosen? All the girls are on the Sealing team. I guess my Chakra control is clumsy! I-I didn't mean it like that! The rest of you will work under Yamato
and I to provide protection. I'm sure you've already thought
about it... But those guys who are after
the Three-Tails won't sit by and watch while we finish sealing the beast. They are bound to attack. Those guys with the Crystal Style user! Bring them on! How will we team up for this? Yeah, about that... I have an idea. C'mon, don't hold back. Tell us! The most critical part of this battle
is to stop the Crystal Style user. However, if we all confront her,
the Sealing team won't have protection... So I'm thinking of splitting up
this team into two, with one team focusing on her. Naruto, Sai, Shino! - Right!
- Gotcha! You three will work under me
to fight the Crystal Style user! As for the rest... Yamato, you guys take care of them. Understood... Okay, those of you who
weren't called, gather 'round! He makes it sound like
we're the rejects... Now, now... Let's go for it with
the eagerness of youth! Yeah... What were you doing? Isn't it obvious? I was reporting to Kabuto...
about the movements of the Leaf. And...Kabuto said he was going back
to see Lord Orochimaru immediately. At a time like this...? Well, I guess he has lots of things
on his mind. I see... Rinji... Huh? About earlier, I believe you... Huh? Preventing the sealing
of the Three-Tails, and the destruction of the Hidden Leaf. Things are gonna get busy about now. The Hidden Leaf are here... First, we have to destroy them.
Capturing Three-Tails comes after that. Hah! Who cares? Lord Orochimaru has
high hopes for me. My wish... my wish is to be
with Lord Orochimaru. And this guy Orochimaru will do
anything to achieve his ambitions. He's a bastard who thinks nothing
of taking peoples' lives! Anyone who serves a guy like
that can't be a decent human being! Damn! What's wrong with me...? What're you doing in a place like this?
Thinking up strategy? This guy...
When did he show up? Sort of... How long has he been here? Oh... the mist is clearing. Yes, it's time to move! All of you, have you memorized
the plan of action? If that child is discovered during
our operation, protect him. All right, let's begin.
Tenten, please show it to us. Yes. This is the giant scroll that was
specially prepared by Lady Tsunade for the sealing of the Three-Tails! Here! Naruto! Huh?! We're gonna use
this humongous scroll? Yes. We have to suppress
a huge amount of Chakra. Kakashi, we're counting on you. You got it! Guard Team Two,
in your positions! - Right!
- Right! Naruto! We go our separate ways now.
Good luck. Yeah! Leave it to me! Okay, then we'll maintain
this Chakra balance, and slowly enlarge the opening. If the Three-Tails is below the barrier,
we'll get a reaction. Just a minute! If we continue with such
delicate Chakra Control and the enemy appears,
we won't be able to oppose them. I'm already aware of that! We won't have to fight back. Believe in your comrades
to take care of the enemy. You just concentrate on
your Chakra Control. Next time:
"The Four-Corner Sealing Barrier"

 Tune in again!

 All right, let's begin. Everyone, in your positions! Let's go! Well, we'll get started too! Why do you look so depressed? Huh? I'm not depressed... Just disappointed that
I'm not on the team that's going to battle
this amazing Crystal Style user. Hey hey... We're Chunin now. I understand you wanting
to fight someone strong, but this isn't the time to be selfish. And besides,
her henchmen are ridiculously strong too. Really? Please tell me all the details! Y-Yeah sure. They were a ton of trouble... Can I listen in? Sure... Anyway, they lay a smoke screen,
which is a real pain. A smoke screen? Is it toxic? Or... Just listen until the end. Then will you just get on with it? Oh, right.
You two have never met before. Sharp of you to notice, Naruto. This here is Sai. He came from the Anbu Black Ops
and he's sorta gloomy and depressing... like he's missing something... Just a weird guy who's
constantly reading books. Naruto... But he draws great! And he's pretty strong! And this guy is Shino. Umm... Shino is... well, Shino. You're Shino Aburame. You're the son of Shibi Aburame. You have participated in
numerous missions relying on your skill in combat,
as a bodyguard, and in search and seizure. You're a specialist in the Secret Jutsu
of manipulating Parasitic Insects. Right? Hey, Sai. How come you know so much? You've done your research.
But I guess that goes without saying. After all, you're a former
Anbu Black Ops member. Well, now that you know each other,
we can be a team. Naruto. My favorite foods are wild grass salad
and winter melon. Huh? I don't like...
foods that have a strong odor. I see. So what of it? Since we're on the same team,
we should know about each other. It affects our teamwork. Shino... It really doesn't matter
what kind of foods you like. Wh-What? Naruto... You really need to
know more about me. Because it would be strange if a newcomer knows more
about me than an old friend. I guess I'm just not on
the same wavelength as you guys. Four-Corner Sealing Barrier

 Gozu... Yes? What do you think about Kabuto? I just don't like the guy... Well, forget it. After I get rid of the Leaf,
I can grab his ponytail and... Yuukimaru is simply a tool
to control the Three-Tails. Why the hell am I feeling
so irritated! Damn it! Let's go! I will accompany you,
no matter where you go... It's all clear. Damn! I'm soaking wet! You're lucky you don't get wet, Nurari! What is that? Your pet? Good work. All right... Shall we go
with the usual strategy? Bro...? Huh? Yeah... Let's do it the usual way. We will proceed with
the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. First, we'll locate the Three-Tails
and then move on to the Sealing Jutsu. I've already shown you
the hand signs. Ready? Four-Corner Sealing Barrier... Search! All right, let's go right
into the Jutsu. This should do for now. We'll maintain this Chakra balance,
and slowly enlarge the opening. If the Three-Tails is
below the barrier, we'll get a reaction. Ready? Please wait a minute! If we continue with
such delicate Chakra Control... and the enemy appears... We won't be able to oppose them. We won't have to fight back. Huh?! You just concentrate on
your Chakra Control. And believe that your comrades
will take care of the enemy. I understand. - Ino!
- Oh! Are you all right?! How can I stay alert for the enemy? I don't even know if I can maintain
this level of Chakra Control... You'll be fine, Ino. I know you can do this... Sakura... Chakra Control is basic to us, right? You'll be fine, Ino! You can do it,
I'm telling you! Chakra Control is the foundation
of Medical Ninjutsu. Now, let's try again. Get a fix on the opening! Gently... Keep it very fine... You've persevered too... Hah, don't belittle me! Of course, I... can do this! You got it? What do you-? The strategy to capture
the enemy, of course! Like I told you earlier... In that smoke screen,
visibility is almost zero... And as much as I hate to admit it,
even Akamaru's nose is useless... Yet the enemy knows our position
and keeps attacking... Basically, we should avoid fighting
inside the smoke screen, but... No! That's just running away
from the enemy, and will only make it harder
to defeat them. That's why I said they're a nuisance-- And I'm saying I figured out a way! Lee, now that you're a Chunin,
you're using your brain as well. You're not just a workout addict. Good job...
Well then, why don't you tell us your plan? All right, the strategy is... - The strategy is...?
- The strategy is...? The strategy is... Is...? It's... Guts! If we have the guts,
there's no enemy we can't beat! Huh?
What's the matter, everyone? Why you--!
Keeping us in suspense! And that's all you have? - Quit fooling around!
- Wh-What? What did I do?! I take it back.
He's just a workout addict, after all. All right! Let's go! Right... Shino, how's it going over there? I need a little more time... All right... Sai. Basically, we'll keep
the same formation... that Yamato used when he was captain. Yes...Senpai. Huh? Oh right. You also came from there. Huh? There? Anbu Black Ops. The way they fight, they have no protocol to protect
their comrades. But this time, we're fighting to protect
our comrades at all cost. I want you to keep that in mind... Don't worry. Having faith in my comrades... I'm here because
that's something I believe in now. Hey, you're beginning to understand... The place where someone
thinks of you, that's the place you go back to... That's right.
There are friends thinking of you. That's why you can return to them... Friends who have faith in you... I finally found the place...
where I can go back to. Right, Guren? He still doesn't understand the true
meaning of thinking about someone. She is tricking him... They're coming! Anyway, I need to keep
my distance from Shino... You won't get away this time. Why you--! I finally found the place
where I can go back to. You've tricked Yuukimaru into
believing you're a friend! Shut up! Too easy! Naruto! It's begun... Here they come! Captain Yamato!
It's the smoke-screen guy! So he's the vanguard... Well then...! Nice, Captain Yamato! Wait, Lee! Leaf...Whirlwind! What? Eat this! Vanishing Smoke Prison! - This is bad...
- I told you! I'm going to backup Lee! No! You may end up
attacking each other... This is the smoke screen
Kiba talked about... He was right.
I can't see in front of me. Then... Rinji, we're ready anytime.
How's his position? Rinji? There's something I must do... Huh? Hey, Rinji? I can't sense anyone's presence... How far does the smoke spread?
Is everyone else caught up in it? What should I do? Lee... A Ninja never gives up,
even if all his senses are shut down. Yes, Guy Sensei... If you recall your days of harsh training,
this is nothing. We have something stronger
than the five senses, the vision of the heart. The vision of the heart... Right! Seize the enemy with
your Spirit sensor which you developed through
unceasing diligence and determination! Spirit sensor! Wise words, Guy Sensei! All right! Spirit sensor... On! Rinji! How can you change
the strategy now?! I've got something through
my Spirit sensor! Without Rinji's power,
this strategy won't... What? What is that? What happened, Kihou?! Hey! Damn... Where the hell is he...? Shadow Dance! Severe Leaf Hurricane! He did it! It's over! That guy! Making us worry. That means... Only the enemy is in
that smoke screen now. Rising Dragon Control! What's going on?! Damn it!
Our positions are totally reversed! Just get rid of
this damned smoke screen! It's not over yet... Right now,
it's worse if we can't see. Wh-What's happening?
Were these guys this weak? They're not much, these guys. I expected more of a fight. If this keeps up,
I'll be treated like a useless Ninja. And besides, her henchmen
are ridiculously strong too. We can't stay like this, Akamaru... - Th-This is bad!
- Let's run! Akamaru! Dynamic Marking! Wh-What is this?! It stinks! I can erase the smell!
Vanishing Smoke Prison! Everyone, retreat! How did you know our position?! Akamaru's Dynamic Marking is special. Even your gas cannot eliminate the smell. You guys made a fool out of me... Eat this! Fang Over Fang! You did it! - We did it!
- Oh well... It seems there was role for me to play. I was a diversion so that
he couldn't accumulate fighting power... Kakashi Senpai read
the situation perfectly. But this Crystal Style Counter team... They're coming! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! The small fry can stay out of this! Kakashi Sensei! Come at me with all your might!
Sharingan Kakashi! Unfortunately,
I'm not the hot-blooded type. Where'd you hide Yuukimaru?! That's none of your business! It's my fault that he went over
to you guys! I won't let you use him
like some kind of tool! I'm gonna beat you
and rescue Yuukimaru! Shut up! As if...you understand! Damn! Damn it! Not yet? These guys require more Chakra
than the usual Parasitic Insects. And that's... in order to bring down
the Crystal Style user! That was really close.
So, are they ready?
 If they weren't, I wouldn't have come.

 Humph... If it isn't the Insect user.

 Your Jutsu is useless against me.

 Your Jutsu won't work against me.

 And that's because my insects are
now resistant to your Crystal Style.
 What?!

 Now the tables have turned.

 Get ready.
I won't let you get away now!
 Next time:
"Breaking the Crystal Style"

 Sorry to keep you waiting. Hinata, have you been eating
cinnamon rolls again? H-How do you know? My sense of smell has become
outrageously keen lately. I-Is that so?
You're amazing, Kiba. But that's not always a good thing. If something's troubling you,
you can talk to me. - That's what a team is for...
- In fact, it's caused me some problems. When walking around town,
the smell of perfume makes me nauseous... A barbecue place could be
several kilometers away, but the smell makes me hungry... Anyway, possessing a superior power
is like a double-edged sword. Other geniuses can
understand this problem... Kiba... Huh? That's...! It's a kusaya. My payback for
the way you ignored me earlier. Wh-Why you...! K-Kiba, are you all right? I found a weakness
in the most unexpected place. Tune in again!

 The small fry can stay out of this! All right! Come at me, Kakashi! Breaking the Crystal Style

 Hide my face, but not my butt! Oh? I'm a schoolgirl in love
with her Senpai! O-Oh? Hey Senpai!
Are you still angry? Let's be friends and
look for Three-Tail's together. Get lost! But if we don't get to work,
the others will chew us out. Please give me a break. I know! I'll let you take
a special peek inside the mask. I said get lost! Oh Senpai! I just might go somewhere
for real if you say it like that! I have no choice... I'll go search by myself for a while. So this is the power
she kept hidden... So persistent... And when your ink drawing
doesn't work, you run away... Is that your Ninja Art? There are other uses for my ink. What...? Ninja Art: Ink Flush. What's the matter? Come at me! I'm fed up... When we last fought,
she didn't release all her power? The next one's for real! Crystal Style:
Burst Crystal Falling Dragon! Wha--?! Die! She can turn anything
she touches into crystal. In other words, Water, Earth
nor Wood Styles have any effect. However...this will...! Did I do it...? So naïve... Too bad, Kakashi. The three-tailed dragon was
just a diversion to keep me here... For all the talk I've heard,
your Sharingan isn't much. Well now, playtime is over. It's useless. Now then, where is it, where is it? Actually, where should I go... Huh? I've discovered an awfully suspicious lake! Hmm? What're they doing anyway? They're from the Hidden Leaf... H-Hey! Ino... focus on the Chakra
for the barrier! R-Right! Barrier? Hey no way...
That's impossible. Huh? Oh my... There's another one... But I've never seen him before. The Hidden Leaf...
are looking for Three-Tails? Oh well... I guess I'll just sit back and watch. Okay, let's settle this! Kakashi Sensei...! Prepare to die...! What?! Oh! Shino! Just in the nick of time.
Are they ready? If they weren't, I wouldn't have come. Humph... If it isn't the Insect user. Your Jutsu is useless against me. It's useless! Didn't I tell you? It's useless. I wonder about that... What?! It can't be! Your Jutsu won't work against me. And that's because
my insects can evolve limitlessly. They are now resistant to your Jutsu. Yes, you did it! That's amazing! That's impossible...
My Crystal Style can't be defeated... Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! I won't let you get away now! Stay still! Where is Yuukimaru?! Why do you...?! You want that boy's power too? I don't need anything like that! I wonder about that... Now...! Her Crystal Style
has been sealed! Tell us! Where is Yuukimaru?! Why you--! This is...! Guren... This is...mud? It seems that Crystal
mends itself right away. Damn it! There's no end to this! Focus the Insects' attack on one spot. Guren... I can't keep up...! Lightning Blade! A mud wall?! Gozu?! Gozu, you... What're you doing?! Let go! I'm going to kill them...! Gozu...? I won't let you through! Guren! Are you all right, Kakashi Sensei?! Yeah... But... Guren got away. She was the key to finding Yuukimaru...! It's regrettable... My insects performed flawlessly,
yet she got away... All right, we'll split up and search! Naruto, you go with Shino.
Sai, come with me! You said that they were formidable, so I was burning with the desire to fight... What was that?
They were so easy to beat. Yup... They were so different
from the last time. Are you real sure about these
next guys? Don't let your guard down. Y-Yes! Kakashi Senpai had
his hands full with her. The Crystal Style user is no joke! I'd love to face her in battle... to see if my Taijutsu is effective
against her! Let's split up into two groups here. Lee and Tenten will guard
the Sealing team by the lake! And we will join up with Senpai's team
who are battling the Crystal Style user! Right! Huh? I won't be able to fight
the Crystal Style user? We don't know where
the enemy may appear. I just told you not to
let your guard down...! - Y-Yes!
- Yes! SEARCH Huh?! Just now...! I know... It's close... Directly below us... It's finally come... We are switching from the "search" mode
of the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. Keep your breathing soft and steady. Here we go! - Four-Corner Sealing Barrier: Bind!
- Four-Corner Sealing Barrier: Bind! BIND We'll quietly sink the net.
Do not let the Three-Tails detect us! Oh no, Senpai!
It is the Three Tails, after all...! Right, he's not here... Huh?! Does he intend to stop them? The enemy...! Concentrate! But! Leaf Hurricane! What?! Lee! Tenten! We've taken care of
the enemy on that side, so we rushed over. I'm glad we made it in time! Now that I'm here, I won't allow you to lay
a finger on these four! There should've been others to stop you... Oh, them...
They were no match for us. Damn... So Kigiri and
the others were beaten... Now then, I am your opponent! What? Running away?! Uh-oh... This is bad. Real bad! At this rate,
the Three-Tails will be sealed! But if I go out now, I might lose.
I'm outnumbered. Right, Senpai? And he's not here... Humph...
Useless, the whole lot of them. The Hidden Leaf ritual aims
to seal the Three-Tails. They've chosen a path
which will prevent anyone from using the Three-Tails. But I won't allow that. Yuukimaru...? Guren... No... The white camellia
cannot become a red one. You promised...that you'll come back! Gozu... You... Yuukimaru...? No! This grass whistle... No way... No way... It's impossible... Did I kill that boy's mother...?! That's... That's...! Guren... We must go. You?! I thought you returned
to Lord Orochimaru. There's something more pressing. The Hidden Leaf has started
to seal the Three-Tails. What? We'll use Yuukimaru to
control the Three-Tails. And we'll destroy their barrier. Kabuto, I need to talk to you. What, at a time like this? I know that. But you of all people should know
what would happen if we make Yuukimaru use
his powers any further... Huh? Is that all? Tell me the truth! Why're you so upset? It's none of your business
whether Yuukimaru lives or dies. It is...my business. Oh? So even the devil sheds tears? To think that you,
who have killed countless people, would have a soft spot for Yuukimaru. Now that is a surprise. He's special... Because you killed his mother? How did you...? There's nothing unusual about that. It's as Lord Orochimaru predicted. He knew that you would
have feelings for the boy. That's exactly why he chose you. If you like,
I can tell Yuukimaru for you... That the kind, gentle Guren
whom he believes is the one he should return to... is the evil villain who killed his mother... Stop! Then, carry out my orders. Tenten... We don't know when
the enemy will appear again. Please stay alert. You endeared him to you very skillfully... Lord Orochimaru... I hate to admit it,
but you were right to select that woman... Guren will grow to love Yuukimaru?
Is that even possible? Kabuto, you have much to learn. The more time you spend with someone, the stronger the bond becomes. That is human nature. Is that so...? Those two...
Their ties go deep indeed. It's likely that Guren will disobey
my order and betray me. Then... I guess that time has come...
Lord Orochimaru... Sai, how is it?

 Still no reaction to
the Crystal Style user.

 She used up considerable Chakra
during that last battle.

 Now is the time to strike.
I don't want to give her too much time.

 I agree. I'm going to widen
the scope of my search.

 Damn it! Where'd she disappear to?!

 Naruto, patience is the key.

 I know!

 But the boy...
I'll find him for sure.

 Next time:
"The Battle Over the Barrier"

 Tune in again!

 We're almost there. Are you ready, Yuukimaru? Do I really have to do this? That is your duty. But I know it's going to make me
feel awful again... If you like, I can tell Yuukimaru for you... That the kind, gentle Guren whom
he believes is the one he should return to, is the evil villain who killed his mother... Stop! Then, carry out my orders. We're running out of time. Let's hurry. How is it? There's been no reaction. I see... She used up considerable Chakra
during that last encounter. This is the time to strike. I don't want to give her too much time. I agree. I'm going to widen
the scope of my search. Damn! Where'd that
Crystal Style user disappear to?! Don't panic. I know... But if we let her slip away,
Yuukimaru will... I'll find him no matter what...! The Battle Over the Barrier

 Cripes, what's going on...? This is the pits.
You guys are on the verge of death. Hah! Speak for yourself. Oh... I feel like I'm gonna faint... As if I'm gonna die in a place like this! Not after we survived
that hellhole of a camp. That's the seal to capture the Three-Tails. This is bad. They're well into the ritual. Now then, Yuukimaru... We don't have time...! Hey Guren, do something. Guren... Never mind! You... Are going to betray us? I have no intention of defying you. But that Jutsu will
cause too much damage. So please... Let me try one more time. Not that again?
At a time like this? In your reluctance to use Yuukimaru,
you've lost almost all your men. On top of that,
you yourself have been beaten... And you still think you can fight? That's... The least you can do in that state is... Well... There is a way without
using Yuukimaru. But time is of the essence. This is on the condition that
you follow my orders completely. I understand. The minute you show signs of defiance, or if you fail, I won't hesitate to use him. Yeah... Humph, all right then. Come, Yuukimaru. Don't worry.
I'm taking him where he'll be safe. And what's the plan? I'll tell Rinji the plan.
You just follow his instructions. The Three-Tail's power
won't reach you here. Will Guren be okay...? She's the one who insisted on this. She'll have to do it even if it kills her. Do not move from this spot. Tell me the plan. Guren... Hurry it up. You're wasting time. Yes. According to Kabuto,
there are two guarding the seal; one is a Weapons user
and the other a Taijutsu user. They've already gone through
a surprise attack, so they've increased their guard. I see. In other words, the way to catch
their attention is a flashy diversion. A decoy is necessary. All right. Let's do it. I'll take care of those two in front. But are you sure about this, Guren...? I have enough Chakra to be a decoy. You focus on finding
the right moment to break the seal. The Three-Tails is completely
ensnared within the seal. Good. Now let's narrow the sphere
of the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier until the Three-Tails' freedom
is totally restricted! - Yes!
- Yes! - Huh?! Tenten!
- I know! Who's there?! Two kids protecting the precious seal?
What a laugh. That Jutsu...! Are you the Crystal Style user?! Isn't the Crystal Style Counter team
supposed to deal with her?! So what'll you do? Run away with your tails
between your legs? No such thing!
I'd like nothing better than to battle the Crystal Style user
everyone's been talking about! That's some confidence...
for a kid from the Hidden Leaf! Concentrate, everyone! The net is tight enough! Now we'll lock it from all four sides
and completely seal the Three-Tails! - Right!
- Right! Four-Corner Sealing Barrier... Lock! I'm your opponent! This resistance is strange...
It's as though... Too bad. She covered her body with crystal...? Damn... Normally, I'd have beaten enemies
like them long ago. Not yet! Judging from the Chakra I have left, there's just one or two more Jutsu
I can use. If that's the case! I'll end it with this next one! Ino! My control... Did we fail? I'm sorry! The net isn't broken yet! Synchronize! We'll lock the seal once more! Die! Now! - This is bad!
- Shoot! Eat this! Collaboration Ninjutsu!
Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol! What?! Naruto...! Yay, we did it! That's the way it should be! I finally found you, Crystal Style user! Why you--! Whatever it takes...
that seal must be broken! Shino! Wh-What?! The seal! Senpai. Hmm? It's you, Yamato. As you predicted, we encountered
the enemy's diversionary team. But they weren't very strong and ran off. Then we split up into two... I sent Lee and Tenten
to protect the Sealing team. How about you? It's bad. We found a way to counter
the Crystal Style, but she gave us the slip. What?! Quickly, go help protect
the Sealing team. Damn it! We won't be able to sustain the barrier! I-It's so huge...! Wha--?! What is this?! Oh no! What Chakra! This is the Three-Tails...! The barrier is broken! Senpai! Our assignment...is here! Brother... I'm scared! That shock wave...! What kind of dangerous place did
you summon us to this time?! This isn't the time to talk like that! Our goal has been achieved. You've lost the Jutsu
to seal the Three-Tails. Why you... I can't forgive you! Rinji, pull back! You won't get away! No! Guren... G-Guren! Get away! Where'd they go...? There... No! No...! Stop...! Don't! No...! Kabuto... You seem to be
having a hard time drawing out Yuukimaru's power. If you try to force it out,
it won't be real power. When there is true desire in the heart
and that desire is strong... that is when he finds real strength
that even he did not know he had! Is this...? What is that...? I've seen it before... It's just like back then... Yuukimaru! Huh?! Guren, did you finish
your moving reunion?

 Rinji, it's you.

 I blocked the Hidden Leaf's Sealing Jutsu.

 Now let's go back with Yuukimaru.

 It was you, all along.

 Huh? What are you talking about--?!

 Well, let's get along for
Lord Orochimaru's sake.

 You... Why?!

 Since you're the trigger to
move Yuukimaru,

 who's the tool to control the monster...

 Next time: "Red Camellia"

 Let's see, today's mini-corner is... Huh? It's terrible, Naruto! - It's terrible! Naruto!
- It's terrible! Naruto! About today's mini-corner... Oh, I have the script right here. - You won't believe this!
- The script is blank! Huh?! Our staff is slacking off. They left the studio! Date! Come on out! A cue card... What?
Ad lib this part? I'm tired from the main episode! Well then! I shall perform a one-man act
to show off my beautiful body... That won't bring in high viewer ratings! I'll use my feminine wiles
to snare the boys... Instead! How about my weapon collection... This calls for the main character,
that's me! And I'll... There's something weird
about the movement! Hey! I thought I made it in time... What... I can't...move... Oh no... It stopped! Even the color... Hey Datecchi! Cut it out! Huh?! Do you want me to draw this in?
Director? Tune in again!
 
 Yuukimaru! Guren...! That Tailed Beast was going crazy...
so what happened to it? This is... Yuukimaru! He's here?! Red Camellia

 Is everyone all right?! Thank you, Lee. We've used up considerable Chakra,
but we're all right. The Three-Tails' Chakra was enormous
and yet... Captain Yamato! Yeah, I know!
But recouping takes priority. We will join up with
the Sealing team as ordered. Right! Just what happened anyway...? I'm concerned about Naruto
and the others. Let's hurry! Yes. Hmm... What's going on here? Guren's crisis triggered
the power surge? Well now... This is worth testing. I'm glad...that you're all right, Guren. But... My mother never returned. Everyone has left. Is he talking about his hometown? He lost the place
where he could return to... Yuukimaru...? What have I done...? Forgive me... Yuukimaru... Guren, hurry... Run... That's...! You... This is...! I have this, so... You know... This one is for you, Guren. You want to exchange it, right?
All right. This time, I'll hold your hand... Hurry...hurry... And yet... Someone like me... is in your thoughts?! Yuukimaru! Guren! I told you to wait... But...I was worried about you... And I thought if I keep thinking about you,
you'll come back. The place where Yuukimaru
can return to... I stole that from him... What I can do for him is... If I'll do...
If that's what you want... I'll...I'll be the place you can return to. Is the touching reunion over? Rinji?! Yuukimaru! Get down! We successfully thwarted
the sealing of the Three-Tails. I'm taking Yuukimaru and leaving. So you were the one. What the hell are you talking about? Look, for Lord Orochimaru's sake,
let's be friends. After all, you're the tool that
controls the beast. You're the one who can trigger
Yuukimaru's actions. You... Why?! Guren! Are you all right?! Guren! I'm okay... I'm glad... Because...I have this. Uh-huh... Me too. Huh?! Guren! That was Mom's grass whistle just now. I can see the red camellia at last! Mother...! No... This can't be... Yuukimaru! Yuukimaru. Guren is in no condition to move. You have to stop the Three-Tails... Yuukimaru! Guren will die if you don't do anything! No... Guren is the place I return to. Yes, Yuukimaru. When your beloved Guren
is in danger, that is when your powers awaken. If you don't stop the Three-Tails,
Guren will be killed! No... Not that... I don't want that to happen! Wow, that's amazing...
It worked even better than I expected! I have no doubt...Yuukimaru is here! Naruto! You're late, Kakashi Sensei! What's that light? What's going on? It's him! Yuukimaru is here! You mean, the boy who controls
the Three-Tails? We have to go and save him! Wait, Naruto! There's been a change of plans. We're going to protect the boy
who controls the Three-Tails. Let's follow Naruto! - Right!
- Right! Wait for me, Yuukimaru! Could that boy be manipulating
the Three-Tails? That's bad! I have to let Senpai know! Like, D-Deidara Senpai! That's his limit? He's a kid, after all...
He's running out of Chakra. Damn it! I have to save her! I have to save Guren...! Don't come! Go away! Guren is... Guren is the place I can return to! Guren! I won't let you kill Yuukimaru! You stay back, got it? Okay. Fructify! Crystal Style: Crimson Fruit! Guren! If you stay there,
you'll be safe from any kind of attack. Okay. Stay there and wait for me. Be careful, Guren! There's no need to worry about me! I'm coming for you, Yuukimaru! I have to keep it away from Yuukimaru. Damn it...
We can't carelessly close in... Naruto! Yuukimaru! Where are you, Yuukimaru?! Crystal Style: Wild Dance of Shuriken! He's... going for Yuukimaru! Like I'd let you! I have to stop him somehow... Guren... Not...yet! Crystal Style: Crystal Wall, 8th Formation! I guess...
my Chakra is reaching its limit... The Three-Tails? She's...! Is that...Yuukimaru? He's...the Ninja from the Leaf! What?! Shoot! Come on! I-It's too big! I won't let you touch Yuukimaru! I'm here to take him from you! But before that... It seems there's something
I've gotta do! Go! Damn, he's so tough!
I can't find a single weakness. You're pretty dumb, aren't you? Are you picking a fight with me?! The fact that a guy like him defends it means there's a spot that
he doesn't want you to attack, right? You're all talk! Damn! A short time... Just a short while... Change my life into Chakra... Chakra Points! Life and Death! Guren! Crystal Style! Arrow of Light! There's no way to harden an eyeball,
that's for sure! Eat this! Giant Rasengan! That did it! You're pretty good. Next, I'm gonna settle things with you! What?! This is the boy Naruto was talking about. Damn... This is an utter failure... I must get Yuukimaru back,
no matter what... Where's Yuukimaru?!

 I think we're the only two
who were swallowed

 by the Three-Tails back there.

 Then he is still by the lake...

 Either your guys got him...

 or one of my comrades saved him...

 Then, I'm going to defeat you
and get out of here.

 I have no intention of fighting
someone in your condition...

 Shut up!

 Wait! Something's coming this way!

 Next time:
"Strange Bedfellows"

 Tune in again!

 I was totally useless... In fact, I was just in the way... Lee, you're always so positive and
once you work up a sweat, you're able to forget
every negative thing, aren't you? I'm just not like that... This is not sweat. These are tears of frustration! This time, at least, I wanted to be useful
and I had prepared thoroughly! I-I know how you feel.
This time, I also wanted... Kakashi Sensei! - Na-!
- Where's Naruto?! That's... Who's that boy? Probably...the one who can control
the Three-Tails... This boy is the one with
that special power. The Three-Tails has disappeared
into the lake, but this isn't over by any means. We'll wait for the Sealing team
to recover, and then we'll attempt the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier again. However... we can't move this child right now. When he regains consciousness, we'll move to a safer spot
and make preparations. Meanwhile, we need to find Naruto. Naruto... Don't worry. Knowing Naruto, he's probably in
the lake doing the breaststroke. Yamato, Sai, Kiba, Hinata... And myself.
The five of us will search for Naruto. Shizune, you come with us
just in case Naruto is injured. Right. Sakura and Ino will treat the boy. The rest of you will keep guard. The enemy is sure to return
to take the boy. I won't let them!
I will protect the boy, no matter what! Everyone, stay alert and
carry out your mission! Byakugan! Naruto... What if we can't find Naruto,
even with Hinata and Kiba with us? Listen. I know we just tried to seal
the Three-Tails and it's totally exhausting, but we have to be extremely careful
with our Chakra Control. I know. I will redeem myself. I'm absolutely going...
to save this boy. Well then, the least I can do is make sure
your Chakra Control goes well, and do votive squats...! I can't concentrate! Okay. We're supposed to be guarding them. Th-That's right! It's not smart to stay clustered together. Shino is here.
Let's go around the back. What about...me?! You keep watch on top of the roof. Got it! The insects are drastically weakened... Is this also due to
the Three-Tail's Chakra? Where is this...? I know! I was swallowed by
that Three-Tails! Which means I'm inside his belly...! It's so hard! Cripes, his stomach is awful!
What does he eat anyway? Oh...me... You're...! Why you--! I won't let you have Yuukimaru! - Yuukimaru is...!
- Die! Strange Bedfellows

 Rinji! Why you-! What's going on?! Leaving us in the trenches during a fight! We went through hell thanks to you! Now, now. I got an urgent summons
from Guren, so I had no choice. Huh? Wh-What?! Why you--! Wh-What?! It's rude to stare like that! Humph...Things change every second
in the battlefield. H-Hey! Quit complaining. Where are you going? Rinji...! Isn't he...acting strange? That Rinji. He's lost it. Running away
in the face of the enemy. Who ran away from the enemy? Uh...no... Well... Cripes... Quit staring! You and Rinji... What's with you? Have you ever looked at
your eyes in the mirror? They're not eyes that look at humans. At this rate, you guys will die. A-Are we that bad?! Liar! No! You're just kidding... I'm not kidding. You're not? The flow of Chakra is all over the place... In this case, I'd say you're heading
straight towards destruction. Destruction? My, my.
You fought against a terrifying foe... You, Kihou... In your case, I'd say...you have less
than two hours left and bon! Are you serious?!
What about me? Am I...? Stop! I don't want to know
how I'm going to die! I-I don't want to die!
Please save me, Kabuto! M-Me too! Please save me! I don't wanna go "bon"! No "bon"! No matter how much you beg, there are things I can and
can't do with my Medical Ninjutsu... Ah... - Huh?!
- Huh?! No... No, I can't. I can't do such a thing
to my precious comrades! "Such a thing"?! Please do "such a thing" to us! We'll do anything.
We'll endure anything! I don't wanna go "bon"! Well, since you insist... - Huh?
- Huh? He's being used. He believes
there's someone he can return to... But he's sure to be betrayed. When that happens... He won't have anywhere to go... If wherever someone thinks of you
is the place you return to... Then... I'll keep thinking of him. So Naruto was talking about this boy... Huh? Oh...! Naruto is okay. I'm sure he's somewhere
thinking about this boy... Where am I? It's okay. We're going to protect you
from now on. Protect...? It's gone! It's gone! What's wrong? Is something missing? It's gone...! Gone...! Gone... Gone...! This is... That's... Yuukimaru...? Then... Then...you're... I... I'm forgiven? Have you... You have the gall to ask such a thing
after killing someone... Forgive you...? No...! Absolutely not! Stop... Please stop...! I... My wound... Did you treat it? What's the big idea?
What are you scheming?! Nothing...! Don't lie! Your enemy lies unconscious! Why would you, a Ninja,
pass up the chance to...! I wouldn't do a shameful thing like hurting
someone who's unable to fight! Where's Yuukimaru?! He's not close by. Back then, I think we were the only two
that Three-Tails swallowed. Then Yuukimaru is still by the lake... Either your guys got him... or one of my comrades saved him. Then I have to get out of here
immediately and find out. So it's imperative that we fight. I'm going to defeat you
and get out of here. You won't leave here...
unless you can defeat me. That's true...
I was just thinking the same thing... But... Huh? Wh-What...? Huge bugs...?! These are...mini-Three-Tails! Aw, jeez! What're you doing?! I'll use my Crystal Style...! You can't! Remember?
Not with that injury! Let go! I can run by myself! It's gone...! Gone! What's the matter?
What are you looking for? Found it! I found it! See! It's a pretty crystal... It's not even scratched... I'm so glad. Guren is all right. Guren...? Could it be the person Naruto spoke of,
the one this boy thinks of? Oh...! Are you all right?! Guren is all right. This boy... What's with... He's being used. He believes there's someone
he can return to... But he's sure to be betrayed. Are you all right? Why? Why are you trying to help me? I don't fight an injured enemy... You could've left me for
those Three-Tails back there... That would be disgusting to watch! You're...naïve... Humph! Had it been me, you'd be dead by now. And I'd leave this place...
and look for Yuukimaru. You want Yuukimaru that badly? For Orochimaru's sake?! Well, what about you guys? You discovered Yuukimaru's powers
and now you want him! After all, taking the Three-Tails
means that the Hidden Leaf Village will be in possession of
enormous military power. We don't need such a thing! Liar! The Hidden Leaf Village already
has the Nine-Tails as well as the Jinchuriki! People like you with that kind of power
have no right... to criticize Lord Orochimaru...
or us! And I'm that Jinchuriki! Wha--?! But I... don't use this power. The Nine-Tails has this incredible power
that I can't control with my own strength. I've hurt my comrades before
I even realized it happened... That's why...I don't use its power. If I hadn't told him such a thing... The place where someone thinks of you,
that's where home is. So if someone is thinking about me,
then that's the place I go back to? You told him? But no matter how much someone
thinks of him... If you're gonna use Yuukimaru
for Orochimaru's sake... to make him control the Three-Tails... That's not right. I don't want Yuukimaru to get near
a Tailed Beast. If he becomes like me... No! I won't let Yuukimaru do
such a thing. I don't believe you. He needs a place to return to. When his mother died,
Yuukimaru lost the place to return to... So I'm taking her place...! You should talk!
You're a follower of Orochimaru. I have to tell Yuukimaru that
you're not  the place to return to! Then that's fine! But...for me... that boy... Yuukimaru is...
the place for me to return to! You... Anyway... this isn't the place
to argue about that. While you were unconscious,
I took a look around. It's really complex in there and
I couldn't find anything like an exit. But if we split up and search... Split up? You and me... The two of us...? More than that. We need a thousand guys. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! You three are ordered to take
Yuukimaru away from the Hidden Leaf. Resort to any means necessary
in order to succeed. That power... go and enjoy it
until you're satisfied. Naruto...! Naruto... Here's to the First Naruto Cup Challenge! The Let's-Get-Out-of-This-Crazy-Place;
Find-an-Exit Contest! Let's do it! - Yeah!
- Yeah! In your positions! Ready, set...! Go! With this many guys searching,
finding the exit is a cinch! All right! I'll find it! No, I will! Whatever I do, I have to get out...
and find Yuukimaru... Yahoo! I know! I know where Guren is! Huh? I'm sure Naruto is with her! They're in the Three-Tail's tummy! According to Yuukimaru,
Guren the Crystal Style user is alive...

 And he says that Naruto and this Guren
were swallowed by the Three-Tails?

 That story may have some truth to it.

 But how do you know that Guren is okay?

 If something happens to Guren,
this crystal will break, as well...

 But it doesn't mean that Naruto is okay.

 We need to believe he's still alive
and find the Three-Tails first.

 Next time:
"Guidepost of the Camellia"

 Tune in again!

 Is it true...? Naruto...is inside the Three-Tails? Huh! They're so excited...
just like a kid... I feel so happy. Yeah, almost like it's not me. My fatigue's completely gone.
Not only that... It's as though I'm filled with strength... Listen, we've got to get
Yuukimaru away from the Leaf, no matter what it takes. You worry too much, Four-Eyes. Right now,
I feel like I can't lose to anyone! Not even Guren! Do what you can.
Not that I'm expecting much... Is that story true? According to this child, Yuukimaru, Guren the Crystal Style User is alive... He says that she and Naruto
were swallowed by the Three-Tails. The fact that we've searched this much
and still haven't found him means that story may have
some truth to it... But how do you know
that Guren is okay? Guren made this for me. If something happens to Guren
this will break, as well... I see. That's proof that Guren is okay, but it doesn't mean that Naruto is okay. That's true. No one knows what the inside
of the Three-Tails' stomach is like. Even if he is okay, Naruto is
with that Crystal user, right? It's possible that the two
have already fought each other and settled things. Then Naruto is... Right now, those assumptions
are meaningless. We need to believe he's still alive
and find the Three-Tails first. I'll...look for it... Can you find it? The Three-Tails... Yes...I don't know for sure...
but I sense it... But what'll we do after
we find the Three-Tails? I'll seal it once more. All right. We'll try to rescue Naruto
while you're doing that. In the event the Three-Tails
becomes violent, Yamato, let's have Shino go with you
just in case we find Guren with Naruto. Sai, you stand by up above
in the sky. The rest of you will guard
the surrounding area. Guidepost of the Camellia

 We're up against Kabuto...
no telling what he might do. Look after Naruto. Right... You guys be careful, too. Shino! Let's get going. Understood. Okay, everyone! We're the Sealing Team. Let's move quietly from the very back, so we don't excite the Three-Tails, okay? -Right!
-Right! Naruto... What's the matter? They've been attacked...
every one of my clones. What...? That sound... It's them. This is bad. We're outnumbered... What...? There was one that huge, too?! No choice but to fight. Can you fight in your condition?! Then where's a way to escape?! You're right, there isn't one. Crystal Style: Hexagonal Shuriken! You see! No effect at all. I'll be the decoy, so run when
you get the chance, okay?! Here I go! Take this! Guren! Heh! How do you like that?! -Are you all right?
-Uh...yeah. Damn... Shadow Clone Jutsu! Get on my back right now! I can't do that! Why not?! Because...my...pride... Fool! This is no time for
troublesome talk like that! Put me down, you nimrod! Stay still! Hurry up! Right! Yes! I wonder if things are going all right
for Sakura and the others. That's if Naruto is okay. Of course he's okay. Because he's the person I want to have an all-out match
with one day. What is it, Akamaru? Seems our enemy is
making its appearance. Good timing.
I was just getting fired up! I'll show how I feel for Naruto
with my fists! You people again?! You knew it was us? You can hide your shape and smell,
but you can't hide your bloodthirstiness. I won't lose to an opponent
I've beaten once before! Don't underestimate us. We're not the same as we were before! Dark Smoke Sphere! We can't get near them...like this. We won't lose
in the barrage of grenades! You are so naïve... My Kunai... Appear! Smoke Dragon! What's the matter? They're here...under us... Okay. Sealing Team, get ready! Wait... There's no way out. Guren and Naruto are
looking for a way out. A way out? If we open up a hole from the outside,
that'll be their way out. What's going on? First, we'll have to see what's
at the bottom of the lake. Camellias... Bring me a lot of camellia blossoms... Camellias? Why did you save me? That was my line!
Why did you save me? Because if you died now,
there was no way I could survive. What? You're relying on me? Hey, how is your wound? Don't touch me! Once we're out of here,
you and I are enemies! Suit yourself.
But I'm not handing over Yuukimaru. Why're you so protective of Yuukimaru? I told you before. Regardless of your reasons for
your loyalty to Orochimaru, he is evil. He's probably using you. Like him. Him? At any rate, where you
and Orochimaru are; that's absolutely not the place
for Yuukimaru to return to. I'll go and take a quick look up ahead. Since my clones can't do surveillance. Damn...this looks really deep... Guess we have no choice. Fog...? This is bad! Is it them again?! What?! Hey, who's there?!
What're you doing...? It can't be... Sasuke! What're you doing here? Stop it, Sasuke! I have something to tell you! Stop it! Sasuke! This is the Three-Tails' fog...
I see... This fog shows illusions of
the weakness in the souls of the people who stand
within in it... If I stand inside it,
I will have to face them, as well... Sasuke, stop it! You're...! I've... I've done something to you
that I can never make amends for... I want you to forgive me... Even if it's meaningless now, I will protect your child to the end,
even if it costs me my life! Sasuke... You have a place to return to! Did you forget about that?! Listen, Sasuke! Let go! Let go of me! Pull yourself together, Naruto! What you're seeing is an illusion! What? You saved me. You saw Sasuke Uchiha? Yeah... You know Sasuke? I met him at Lord Orochimaru's place.
He's a scary guy. Is he okay? Is he doing well? Uh, yeah... Why do you ask? Isn't it obvious?! He's one of us! I have to bring him back and tell Sasuke that he has
a place to return to! You... Are you seriously intending
to bring Sasuke back? Of course! That... Sasuke...? This guy must be a real fool. Of all the crazy things,
he wants to save Sasuke...? What's so funny? I've never met such a fool! What brought that out of the blue? You're splitting my sides! Really... Hey, are you all right?! So that's the entrance to
the dimension Yuukimaru mentioned. If we tear that membrane,
we'd create a way out... Now! Lightning Blade! What? The fog lifted...
Could it be flowing outside? Wha--?! When did they...?! Now there's no way to escape. Damn! Not again...! They sure are persistent! One more strike! Come back, Naruto! We're ready! Let's do it now! Naruto, there's something I have to tell you. What is it?
This isn't a good time. Remember I told you that
Yuukimaru's mother is dead? Yeah. I'm the one...who killed her. What did you just say? At the time, Lord Orochimaru was
trying to build the Sound Village. I attacked Yuukimaru's village
on his orders. But I collapsed there after
exhausting my powers. That woman... saved my life,
even though I was her enemy. Get away... I'll close my eyes to this if you go now. Are you planning to betray me, Guren? But... I...I... Out of my desire to be accepted
by Lord Orochimaru... I killed her... I had sealed away the memories
and emotions of that moment. But when I met Yuukimaru,
they all came back to me. Is that why you protect Yuukimaru...? As you said... I hurt Yuukimaru's soul in a way
that I could never make amends. I have no right to protect him... Guren... It's over for me! But I will protect you
even if it costs me my life! You must survive!
Please look after Yuukimaru. It's weird hearing that from you! Whatever happened in the past,
you're different now! You... Camellia? Yuukimaru...? He's trying to show us the way out! Look out! Okay, now! I won't let you die in place like this!
We're going back together! Oh no...

 if anything went wrong and the Leaf
was able to seal the Three tails...

 Lord Orochimaru's future strategy
would be forced to change dramatically.

 I must prevent that.

 Now that it's come to this,

 I don't care if we lose Yuukimaru.

 I'll use all of its power
to drive the Leaf out!

 Next time:
"Counterattack of the Curse Mark"

 Uh, the next scene we're going
to shoot is a thrilling scene in which you infiltrate the enemy's hideout
within 24 hours. Huh? I can't reach the microphone. What's the matter, Captain Yamato? I don't have...my script... -What?!
-You forgot it again? This is the second time. No, I didn't lose it. Today's scene has to have
absolutely no mistakes, right? So I did a careful voice check... For those who don't know,
a voice check is where you rehearse your lines as you watch a video with pictures. ? Making excuses now...? The Leaf Jonin have sure fallen... Uh...that's not what happened... - That's uncool.
- I thought you were better than that. I agree, I agree! Come on, stop saying that... Guess I'll just have to show you mine. Kakashi Senpai... This is mine! Oh...it is? Sorry, sorry. What's more, there're all sorts
of odd doodles in here! Oh..! Give me a break! Tune in again

 Still nothing... Could it have failed? No, there definitely was an impact. But nothing's happening... Hinata, can you see anything? N-No... Not even with my Byakugan... Naruto...Naruto won't come back? Did it reach Naruto? Furthermore, it seems to have awakened
the Three-Tails. Shizune! Sealing team!
Standby for the Three-Tails! Right! Sai! Take Yuukimaru to a safe place. Right! - Let's go.
- No! I'm staying here until Guren returns! I'm sure she's all right. Huh? We're all thinking of Naruto,
that's why he'll return here. If you think of her, Guren will return too.
No doubt about it. Now then... Okay. Go! We will begin
the Four-Corner Sealing Jutsu. Four-Corner Sealing Barrier... Bind! The challenge starts now... Until the Sealing team has
the Three-Tails, it's up to us to suppress it. Now then, we'll see just how well
my Wood Style works against the Three-Tails. All we can do is try... Counterattack of
the Curse Mark

 We'll wait here. All right? Okay. Drink... It will ease your fatigue. You can tell what I'm thinking... Everyone tells me that
I can't read their moods. I doubt that. Really... Dark Smoke Sphere Stay hidden, okay? Okay. Water Shield Shot! Hide-and-seek, eh? I've come for you, laddie. I've been able to determine
Yuukimaru's potential and the limit of his power. However, the Hidden Leaf are trying
to seal the Three-Tails once again... If by any chance, they are successful
in sealing the Three-Tails... When Sasuke achieves
the skills he needs... The time for my reanimation will be near. When that happens, both the Akatsuki and Leaf Village
will be a hindrance. Our current operation is preparation
for when that happens. We won't have to worry about the Akatsuki using
the power of the Three Tails, but... It will force a big change
in Lord Orochimaru's future strategy. We must avoid that... If I use this, we may lose Yuukimaru... However, rather than lose
the Three-Tails... Never mind...if I lose Yuukimaru! I'll use Yuukimaru's remaining power
to make the Three-Tails go wild, and destroy the Leaf Ninja...! Where's Kabuto...? Huh, I heard everything. So Four-Eyes isn't here? So there's no one to give us orders... We're not the same as before. There's no need to hang
around you anymore... Well, it looks that way... You guys are so easygoing. What...? You guys are just cast-offs...
pawns who are no longer useful. And you don't even know that
I've got you in a vital spot. Say that again! You're not one of us anymore! Want to settle it now? Settle? What?! What's so funny?! It's about time! What...?! My body feels strange... I can't stop shaking... Hey, what's happening?! Fools! You should know that
there's a risk to attaining power! I heard your power has
some side effects! Side effects...?! Yeah... And left alone, it will eat you up
from the inside out. N-No... I don't want that to happen! N-No way... I don't want to die! Unless you get the drug from Kabuto
before the time limit, you'll destroy yourselves
with your own power! Kabuto entrusted the drug to me. If you say you won't betray
Lord Orochimaru, I just may give it to you. All right. I swear my loyalty. H-Hurry...give me the drug. Know this! No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to escape
Lord Orochimaru's grasp. Kabuto said this... We've stopped
the Three-Tails' movements. And he wants to see that
power once more. No! When I take that medicine,
my head feels like it's going to burst... Shut up! You will not refuse! Guren hasn't returned yet!
And maybe, she'll never return! Do you want that?! No... No! Then stop being fussy and do as I say! O-Okay... One more time.
Just one more time... Yeah... this is the last time. Here it comes... Is that from Sai? It seems Guren's fellow Ninja have
powered up and attacked Sai. Huh?! Any word from Kiba and the rest? No, not yet. No way... Akamaru, you saved me... If we hadn't hidden underground
due to your quick thinking... Lee... Tenten...? They couldn't have...! Thank you, Akamaru... I'm okay. You're all okay. Not at all. If I didn't summon a protection Wall
from my scroll, we'd have been goners... Lee was no help, rushing in like that... I-I'm mortified... After Guy Sensei often warned me
that pride is a Ninja's enemy... I didn't expect it...
That they'd be so strong. No... That transformation isn't normal.
We must notify everyone! Yes... This fog... We're already in their trap... Protect the Sealing team! Right! Dark Smoke Sphere! Water Shield Shot! - Yamato!
- Right! Wood Style: Giant Forest! Why you--! Getting in the way! Wood Style: Giant Forest Jutsu! Parasitic Insect! What? Hey, stop! Nooo! What's wrong, Akamaru?! Everyone, stop!
Something's strange here. The enemy?! No... This is... It doesn't look like the enemy at all... Tenten! You can tell
what Akamaru is feeling?! Sai! This is the Three-Tails' fog... The sealing isn't complete yet. It's coming...! It's coming! Gather your Chakra! - Yes!
- Right! Cha! Here it comes! Swallow it, Yuukimaru. Huh?! Swallow all of it!
You want Guren to return, don't you? Okay, I'll do it. Because the place
I'll return to is where Guren is... I made it back... Feeling pain means I'm still alive. Naruto... Wake up! Naruto! Yuukimaru... you're okay? This is no time to babble in your sleep! We made it back...? Yeah... Yuukimaru... Where's Yuukimaru?! Multi-Smoke Clone. No... Stop! It tickles... What?! Oh dear... Your cute little bugs
are shapeless now. Well, now for the main show.
Here I come! This is interesting...
I'm taking this! Arise Smoke Dragon! Like Sai reported... they're totally different from before. Sh-Shizune Senpai...! Ino has reached her limit... But... Ino! Just hang in there! Shizune... No way! Not that power again! Yuukimaru! Yuukimaru may not forgive me
when he finds out...the whole truth.

 Are you still mulling over that?

 I'm prepared to protect Yuukimaru, but...

 If I were you, I'd keep thinking of him!

 Even if I'm despised, or rejected...
or resented!

 Whether he thinks that
I'm the place to return to or not...

 has nothing to do with it!

 Yeah, you're right!
I'll become the fool too...just like you.

 Next time:
"Memory of Guilt"

 YAMATO'S ROOM


Shino Aburame,
who loves to collect insects... is our guest today. Getting right to the point... Shino, you're a member of the prominent
Aburame family in Leaf Village, and you're always calm and cool.
Is the rest of your family like you? Silence. Namely... I see. Silence signifies that
you are communicating with the insects you host
inside your bodies? Yes... I understand that in the Aburame family, you do something special from
the time you are born? That is a secret family Jutsu... From the time you are born,
you host insects inside your body, sustain them with your Chakra,
and co-exist. Is that a simple way of putting it? Yes... And you use the insects in
your secret Jutsu to do things like tracking, healing and cloning. And that is your secret family Jutsu,
is that correct? Yes... Can you demonstrate for us? Here...? It's okay if you can't. We're running out of time,
so please do it quickly. Well then... Oops! It's already time.
Our guest was Shino Aburame. It's...over already...? Tune in again!

00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,030
Prepare yourself! Why you--! What do you mean by suddenly
pouncing on Kakashi Sensei like that?! You wrinkly old hag! <i>This old hag...is good...</i> I'll never forget what
you did back then! White Fang of the Leaf, I shall avenge my son's death
by defeating you today! Er...no, you see... I'm... No questions or answers! Big Sister...
Take a good look at him! He resembles him closely,
but this one is not the White Fang! Huh? Uh...hello... Moreover, the White Fang
of the Leaf died long ago. Remember? When you got word of it,
you cried tears of regret, since you could not avenge
your son. Isn't that so, Sis? Gotcha, I was only pretending
to have gone senile. Kankuro! Let me have a look. Please do. Kakashi Sensei and the rest of you,
please stand back a bit. Got it. H-Hey! You're...? I'm a Leaf Medical Ninja. <i>The Medical Ninja's Student


</i> They seem to have used
a heavy metal-based toxin. It's the type that acts upon
the muscles to destroy the cells. Just from that brief examination... You could tell that much... His medical record please. Ah, here it is. This is the list
of toxic ingredients. There are blank spaces here
and there, but... I can predict the general outcome. The cardiac muscle
will be destroyed, and the heart could stop beating
at any time, so... It's difficult to say whether
we can concoct an antidote in time... You don't mean that!
Isn't there anything we can do? Please assemble the items
I request immediately. Roger! It's quite a crude treatment, but
it's the only option we have left. Hold him down firmly, as this will be
a very delicate operation. - Right.
- Understood. Here...goes... Hold him down firmly! - Yes!
- Yes! <i>I'll cause the Chakra
to flow into his body...</i> <i>It will cause the toxin to
surface from the cells.</i> <i>It will then be absorbed
by this liquid...</i> <i>and extracted!</i> So that's the toxin... Yes! Next! - Yes!
- Yes! Say... Kakashi Sensei... Huh? What sort of person was
that White Fang of the Leaf that this old lady here
was talking about? Well, that's hard to say... Hmm, let's see... Well, in a word... He was my father. Hey, you there... Are you the son
of the White Fang? Yes... But of course... So that's why you look
so much like him... - Next!
- Yes! I directly extracted the toxin. With this, his life should
no longer be in danger. Way to go, Sakura! But we still can't rest easy. I will now concoct an antidote
for the traces of toxin that remain in his body. Got it. If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask. Well then, first, I need a list
of the medicinal herbs that can be found in this village,
or something like that... I'll bring it. Please replace all of
his bandages. Yes. And then prepare an IV drip. Yes. Also, please set aside a small amount
of the extracted toxin. I will need it later. <i>Sakura... You're so cool.</i> You're just like
the Slug Girl. To think that a girl just
like you would come here... Yes, Lady Tsunade is my master. And besides, I was told by
my master to come here. Here is the list of medicinal herbs. Thank you. Say Sis... Time is flowing slowly,
but it's flowing. Hey! Takamaru has returned! Master Baki, a reply
has come from Leaf Village. Thank you for your troubles. It's from the Hokage. What's Granny Tsunade saying?! It says that Guy's squad has been
sent here as a reinforcement unit. Bushy Brow Sensei's squad...? I'll bet everyone has gotten stronger. They even said that Neji
has become a Jonin. All right! Now's no time for us to just
be hanging around! We should go after the Akatsuki...
right now! Going after him is
fine and well... But do you know where
those guys have gone to? Um, excuse me for inquiring, but what is the follow-up
to the Akatsuki pursuit? First, Kankuro set off by himself
and ended up like that. Next, a tracking unit was sent out,
but they've yet to contact us. Judging from the situation,
it's likely that... One of the other village chiefs
has gone missing. I don't like to think that
he could be taken out so easily, but... Then, you mean to say
you've completely lost sight of him? Yes, that is so. Lord Baki! Kankuro has awoken! Kankuro, are you all right?! What, you're back already, Temari...? I heard the village was in crisis. Sorry...for making you worry. You fool, don't talk
such nonsense! Please lead me to the place
where Kankuro did battle. I may not look it,
but I'm a pro at tracking... If just the slightest trace
of their scent remains... There's no need of that. My puppets...have all been recovered,
haven't they? I never imagined I'd find
this assortment of medicinal herbs here
in the Hidden Sand. Still, the soil is not well suited
to growing medicinal herbs... In particular, we only have
a small amount of "Scurvy Grass." No, this much is plenty. I can make at least three antidotes. The enemy force was two
in number. One of them led Gaara away... All you have to do it follow
Gaara's scent. Even if they split up into two,
one of them... His smell is on that one... In Crow's hand... I left him holding a scrap
of his clothes... Even if you fall,
you won't fall without a fight... Just what I'd expect from
a Sand Ninja. Kankuro! Are you all right? Y-Yeah... Ah, he came all the way
from Hidden Leaf Village for us. Naruto...Uzumaki...is it? Hey... I see... Summoning Jutsu! Eight Ninja Dogs,
at your service! Pakkun! Hey! Is that you, Naruto?!
Long time no see. Pakkun, you haven't changed a bit,
have you? You haven't either. Eh?! I've grown quite a bit taller. Yes, yes, but enough
of this chatter. I need you to get to work
right away! I want you to determine
which way he headed. Now, go! We'll contact you right away
when we find something. We're counting on you. All right! When Pakkun and the others
get back, we're heading out, I tell you! We've got to make preparations
right away... Naruto, wait a minute! Kankuro...! Granny Chiyo?
Grandpa Ebizo, too?! I want to hear it one more time,
directly from your mouth... There is no mistake that one
of the two enemies was Sasori. Is that correct? What about it, Kankuro? Yeah... It was Sasori
of the Red Sand. He said so himself. Sasori of the Red Sand,
you say? We might be able to find out more
about Akatsuki. Please... It's ready... Be sure to drink it all down... You should be all right now, I think. Just lie there and rest for
a while without moving until the numbness goes away. You should all get
a good night's rest as well. I've prepared a room for you to use. But we've got to find Gaara quickly... I'll take advantage of
your kindness, if I may. We're going on
a harsh march from tomorrow. I understand... <i>I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself.</i> <i>And I must not run away
from my path of solitude.</i> <i>If I do that, someday...</i> <i>Someday...I can be like him...</i> <i>Don't order me around!</i> <i>That's enough outta you!</i> <i>I have never thought
of you all as my brothers.</i> <i>If you get in my way,
I'll kill you.</i> <i>But now there's something
I understand about the bonds</i> <i>he went so far to tell me about.</i> <i>I understand that pain,
sadness...and happiness...</i> <i>can be shared with others.</i> <i>Naruto Uzumaki...</i> <i>I learned that through fighting
and getting to know him.</i> <i>He knew of the same pain
as me.</i> <i>And he taught me that I could
change the path of my life.</i> Naruto Uzumaki... Mm? Take care of my little brother... Heh, you can leave it to me. After all, I am eventually going
to become the Hokage! So I'll do the Kazekage
a favor early on! Aim to remain in active duty
your entire life! Today, the High Achievers Club is pleased to introduce Granny Chiyo
of the Hidden Sand. Well, to get right to the point,
what are your hobbies? - Fishing.
- What a simple answer. Well then,
what is your special forte? - Playing dead.
- Your individuality shines! Well next, what are your concerns
at this time? My grandchild. Hey, are you watching? Sasori? I'll be the one to punish you!
Wash your neck and wait! Next time:
"The Retired Granny's Determination" Wh-What is this?!
The enemy's Jutsu?! A-A slug...?! It's Katsuyu,
summoned by Lady Tsunade. - I'm sorry.
- Forgive me. Why are you here? You came to help us, Katsuyu? Lady Tsunade has
been concerned about the Sealing Jutsu's effectiveness
against the Tailed Beast. She sent me to bring you
the Chakra for the Sealing Jutsu. That will be a big help. Let me distribute it to you. Please proceed. Very well... That Tsunade! She sent Katsuyu... Crap... More! More power! Yuukimaru! Naruto! What is it? Will I be forgiven...? I mean! Will he forgive me? When Yuukimaru finds out that
I'm the one who killed his mother? Sheesh! Are you still
mulling over that? I'm prepared to protect Yuukimaru. If I were you, I'd keep thinking of him! Even if I'm despised,
or rejected, or hated! Whether he...thinks that I'm
the place to return to or not has nothing to do with it!
I'd keep on thinking about him. Yeah, you're right! I'll become the fool too...
just like you, Naruto. What?! Let's hurry! Yuukimaru! I feel the power of the Three-Tails
beneath the water's surface... I-It's enormous... I feel like
the Chakra will explode any minute. Th-This much? Without Katsuyu's Chakra,
my power alone couldn't... Listen! If the Three-Tails falls into the hands of Orochimaru
or the Akatsuki... It will be disastrous
for the Hidden Leaf... But the Three-Tails is
in our hands right now... The only ones who can protect
our comrades in Hidden Leaf Village from this power is us!! - Right!
- Right! Katsuyu...Can you increase
your Chakra even further? Yes... I will try. We will take it to the other dimension
all at once. R-Right. Th-They're still trying to
control the Three-Tails. Yuukimaru, arouse the spirit
of the Three-Tails! Make it go wild! Trample the Hidden Leaf! Memory of Guilt

 Sai, did they attack you too? Yeah... They got Yuukimaru! This is...? No doubt about it! It's them! Wait! Wh-What are you doing?!
It's time to get revenge! If we jump in now, there's a chance
we'll hit each other with friendly fire. Yeah, even Akamaru's sense of smell
will be useless. We must wait and see. Oh man! This is so frustrating! It seems the enemy is using
Yuukimaru to control the Three-Tails. At this rate, Shizune's Sealing team
is in danger. It's a touchy situation... Countering all these clones
is impossible! It's no good! I can't dodge them all!! It's about time... Binding Smoke Prison! To think that I would have the chance
to personally bring down the fabled Kakashi
of the Hidden Leaf. It's worth surviving... Wha--?! Although not to your extent, I use
Shadow Clones too. Lightning Blade! This is bad. They say, something and smoke
like high places. Smoke Dragon! The Wood Style is useless
against smoke, which changes form on its own. Then, I must adapt my style... Water Style! Hand of Waves! What? Smoke is a vapor and by
liquefying it with water... it can't be controlled freely.
Not against me and my Water Style. Your Jutsu is meaningless now. Take this! Don't forget that I have a third arm. Playtime is over. It's useless! Spindle Formation! Why...Why?! Your Jutsu was quite formidable
against my insects. However...the cause of your defeat
lies in the fact that you fought with Hinata of the Hyuga Clan.
To explain... Hinata, I need to speak with you. Shino, what's wrong? Any little thing will do. Can you tell me anything about
that Crystal Style user? Unfortunately, her Jutsu is flawless. Had I not covered my entire body with
Chakra just in time... By now, I'd be... Speaking of Chakra covering
the entire body...! Shino, watch out for that slimy guy! He will be a formidable opponent
against you. Why is that? His Jutsu is his entire body. That body suit is filled with Chakra and he's able to
change his form at will. I used my Gentle Fist against him
and he just twisted his body away. He countered your Gentle Fist... The problem was the body fluid that
got onto my hand when I grazed it. The enemy's entire body is covered
with mucous that looks like birdlime. I had prior data, so from the start... I concentrated on scraping that
troublesome mucous off your body. Since we started...?! Yes! I focused my attacks on making
that mucous membrane as thin as possible so that it would
break easily. That is all. It's over...? Yes... It took some time but... Kakashi Sensei! You're all okay... What about you guys? Well...we made it somehow.
But what about Naruto? We haven't found him yet. I'm sorry about Yuukimaru... Now then, we'll head out
to assist the Sealing team. - Yes!
- Right! And also, we will recover
and protect Yuukimaru! But first, we'll see how
the Sealing team is doing. They seem to be in a difficult battle... This time, for sure...
This time...the Three-Tails... Ino... you don't need to rush it. Just focus your mind on
stabilizing your Chakra. Y-Yes... No good... It's not enough. Damn it! It's not working! Is that all there is
to Yuukimaru's power?! This isn't gonna work anymore. Then I've got to use the last measure,
although I didn't want to resort to it... You're gonna die
for Lord Orochimaru's sake. Here! Yuukimaru! Are you all right? So you guys were alive after all... Snap out of it! What happened? Hey Yuukimaru! Wake up! Yuukimaru! You came back...after all...Guren;
because I was thinking of you... Wherever someone is thinking of you,
that's the place to return to... Yes...that's right. You were thinking of me,
that's why I was able to come back. Uh-huh... When I was trapped in
that other dimension inside the Three-Tails,
all I thought about was you... That's why you have to
return to me too, Yuukimaru... I'm so happy.
I'm coming back to you, Guren... You're the only one I can return to. Yeah right.
That's the only place left for you... Since you can't go running back
to your mama's bosom anymore. Stop! Just shut up. No, let me just say this... Listen!! Yuukimaru! I said to shut up! It's all right, Naruto... But... It's all right! You taught me... Guren... So you're prepared...? How noble. Listen, Yuukimaru! The one who stole the place
you should return to... The one who turned
the white camellia red with your mother's red blood... The one who killed your mother
is that woman... Guren! Guren is actually an evil demon! She hid the fact that
she killed your mother, and got close to you to win your trust;
just to use you. And she has continued to use you! Yuukimaru! Don't you hate her?!
Don't you want to kill her? No one will stop you...
As if I'd stop you! Now take your anger out
on the Three-Tail! And order the Three-Tails
to destroy everything! Why you...! Shut up! Guren... I'm sorry...Yuukimaru.
What he says is true. Please listen to me, Yuukimaru. The Guren of the past committed
many terrible sins in order to serve Orochimaru.
But Guren is different now! She regrets all the things in her past.
She's filled with regret! And no matter what happens,
she will protect you! No matter how much
you may hate her, she will keep on thinking about you.
She swore that to me. I fully realize that no matter
how much I may regret it, no matter how many times
I say I'm sorry nothing will ever erase what I did. If you wish me dead, kill me.
I won't care. But...but if you can forgive me... I will protect you forever. Guren... You're not going to hate me? You're a nice person Guren... You are the one
I should return to, after all... And I'm the one
you should return to, Guren. I promise you... I will never leave your side.
I will always think of you. Uh-huh... And I will
always think of you, Guren. For now, and forever ... And ever... I love you. Yeah, me too. The two of you... Never be parted again! What a farce... You weaklings
can lick each other's wounds... But a bond like that will break easily! What...?! Kabuto! You...! Naruto... If you get in the way, I'll kill you too. Kabuto! You're behind all of this?! You won't get away with it! Kabuto, just what are
you guys aiming to do?!

 It's not only the Hidden Leaf
and the Akatsuki...

 but all the Hidden Villages will soon
engage in long, fierce clashes.

 What?!

 Lord Orochimaru has his eyes
on that violent future...

 That was the plan, but...

 Why you--! That's all gibberish to me.

 Guren!! Go with Yuukimaru!
Protect him no matter what!!

 I won't let you do that.
You two will not be freed.

 Next time: "Shattered Promise".

 Hey you guys. No one has ever seen
Shino's real face, right? Now that you mention it... But haven't you seen his face, Kiba? Nope, I've never seen it either. Not that I care.
What about you, Hinata? I-I've never seen him. Hmm... If no one has seen his face,
I'm even more curious. Maybe he's pretty cool, like Sasuke. What's so great about Sasuke?
Maybe he's like Kakashi Sensei. Then he looks pretty stupid. That's for sure... H-How about eyes like Lee? Huh? Bushy Brow? S-So thick... Then how about something different,
a sexy type? Ahem... Huh?! Shino! - Shino...
- Shino... It can't be helped... If you all insist... - What're you doing here?!
- What're you doing here?! No, stop!!


 Tune in again!

 Everyone... The seal will
be complete very shortly. Maintain your focus until it's over! - Right!
- Right! What is that?! Tenten! There's a monster behind us! - Huh?!
- Huh?! What is that?! Kakashi Senpai! Is that...? What a persistent bunch. It's my turn to pay them back for earlier! Lee, physical attacks
won't work on that slime. Neither will my insects... Cripes, what a nuisance. Perhaps it's better to leave them
to the two Jonin... I wonder if this is what you'd call "gross". - We'll torment you...!
- We'll torment you...! Huh?! They sure are...Gross. Shattered Promise

 What happened to Rinji?! Rinji became part of
my collection, long ago. What?! He was such a nuisance... Continue...eh? I'd be happy to be the one
reporting to Lord Orochimaru... You? I've done many things
for you as your spy. Lord Orochimaru doesn't need
anyone besides me to serve him. Damn it! So it's all going
as you planned... Yes... Lord Orochimaru is
an amazing man. Everything has gone as he predicted. Guren and Yuukimaru's hearts
have become linked so strongly that they trust each other
to be the place to return to. Now, if this close bond is
shattered by their fatal relations Yuukimaru's anger will
release an explosive force. That was supposed  to be the case... However, even when he learned that
Guren killed his mother... Yuukimaru's anger did not explode. Why...? Why is that?! The human heart is
such a strange thing, isn't it? You...are unforgivable! What the hell are you doing with
Guren and Yuukimaru's feelings?! You don't play with people's feelings! Just what are you guys aiming to do?! It's not only the Hidden Leaf
and the Akatsuki... but all the Hidden Villages will soon
engage in long, fierce clashes. Lord Orochimaru has his eyes
on that violent future... That was the reason for
the Three-Tails...for Yuukimaru. That's all gibberish to me. Guren! Go with Yuukimaru!
Show me you can protect him! I will! I'll protect him with my life! I won't let you pass.
I'm gonna kick your butt! Dead Soul Jutsu! Guren... Rinji! I promise I'll protect you. I will not fail. Guren! Crystal Style: Crimson Fruit! Guren! Don't worry. I'll be right back,
so you wait here. Huh?! Wait here. I will come back for you no matter what. Don't go! Guren, you're the only one
I have to return to! Do not worry. I won't  die. What?! It's useless. Crystals are formed when identical polyhedrons
are aligned in a uniform pattern. I can stop the crystals from forming by vibrating the air
with the bats' ultrasonic waves. Yes... Your Crystal Style
was never a threat to me. Didn't I tell you it's useless? You're troublesome
even when you're dead. After Guren,
it's you...Yuukimaru. Huh?! No you don't! I will protect Yuukimaru with my life! Guren! Your Crystal Style...
won't work anymore. Nothing works against the dead. Now you can't manipulate
your bats, can you? Crystal Style! What--?! Return to the underworld quietly! Guren! No...! Don't go! The Jutsu is broken! That...can't be...! You said you'd...
You said you'd protect Yuukimaru...! Yuukimaru! The Three-Tails will be
getting tired soon... Then we'll finish it at once. What?! Where is the Three-Tails
finding this kind of strength? I'm not sure, but it seems
his Chakra suddenly increased. Yamato, use your Wood Style
to restrain it. I will deliver the finishing blow. Right. Lightning Blade! Kakashi Senpai. Yeah. Find the Sealing Team
and rescue them! - Right!
- Right! Three-Tails! The moment he lost Guren,
with whom he shared a strong bond... the latent power in Yuukimaru
was released. To think that the sadness of losing
the place he should return to would be so great... Yuukimaru! Stop...! It's no good! Huh?! Yuukimaru! Can you hear me, Yuukimaru?! It's me! Naruto! Please notice me! Yuukimaru! Damn it! Calm down! Yuukimaru... Kill them all! Destroy them! I'll have to stop it. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Let's do it! Damn it! My Rasengan doesn't work! And yet, I can't use
the Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken. But what I can do... Summoning Jutsu! Bro! That's the Three-Tails, right? It seems things have
gotten out of hand. I wouldn't call you guys otherwise. Gamatatsu, get ready for
the Toad Water Pistol! Right. Wait, Gamatatsu! Huh? What is it?! We're in a hurry here! Think hard. The opponent is
a turtle-like beast that lives in the lake. Even if you increase the power
with the Wind Style, what will be the effect of using
the Toad Water Pistol, which is a Water Style Justu? To beat a Water Style,
you need the Earth Style. If we keep stalling,
the terrain around here will change! I only have the Wind Style
so we have no choice--! Wind Style?! So I'm a good match
with Sasuke, huh? Yes, only wind can defeat lightning. No, that's not what I meant. I mean only the power of wind
can help fire by making it
an even larger power. Fire Style. What about the Fire Style? If we had Fire Style, my wind could... I can use it. Huh...?! You can use Fire Style?! Yeah, I can! Why didn't you say that sooner?! You didn't ask! And? What about the Fire Style? Oh, Fire Style! What is it? Damn it! I thought it was
a good idea... So just tell me what's going on. No... I thought we could
help the "Fire" and make it stronger with my wind. But fire is weak against water. I see! If the Water Style is
stronger than the fire, we'll create an even stronger fire,
which will make the water evaporate. Huh?! Hey, Gamatatsu! What is it, Bro? Go back to the village and drink
all the Toad oil you can! Okay? You have one minute!
I will summon you back in one minute. Gotcha! I get it! If you use oil instead of
water to fire the Toad Water Pistol, the oil will spread everywhere... Then you'll set the oil on fire
with your Fire Style. That's right. We can use the same timing
as the Toad Water Pistol and we won't need to practice first! All right! This'll work! Yuukimaru! Guren... That promise
you couldn't keep... I swear I'll keep it for you! Naruto! It's one minute! Right! Summoning Jutsu! Did you have enough time? Uh-huh. Just about. Mmm, we're ready, Naruto! Yeah! All right! We'll use
this new Collaboration Jutsu... and burn off its face! Its weak point is the eyes! All right, are we set?! It's do-or-die!
Failure is not an option. Right, Bro. Let's do it, Gamatatsu! Okay! Collaboration Jutsu!
Wind Style: Toad Flame Bombs! Now! We did it! It worked, Bro. Yeah... You did a good job. Looks like it's over for now. Well then, we'll be going. Yeah... Thanks. See you. Yuukimaru! Yuukimaru... Let's go home together. I'm sorry. It was not part of my plan
to have the Hidden Leaf interfere.

 So, is Guren dead?

 Unfortunately.
She had an interesting ability...

 You don't mean it.
You're just saying that.

 And about Yuukimaru...

 Leave it.

 It doesn't matter
once I have his  body...

 Next time: "A Place to Return to"

 Tune in again!

 A Place to Return to

 Oww! Try to bear with it. This should ease the pain a bit. Thank you, Sakura... The wound is deep.
I'll do what I can here... Sakura... How is Yuukimaru doing? Shizune Senpai and the others
are tending to him now. This is terrible. His Chakra Network is... Yes, he's suffered a lot of damage... Even with treatment, it'd be impossible to restore him
to normal completely. It seems the power to control
the Three-Tails took quite a toll on Yuukimaru's body. The Jutsu reduced his life...? Yes. I can't be certain until we conduct
a thorough examination, but it's likely that Yuukimaru no longer
has the powers he once had. We've now lost our only chance
of controlling the Three-Tails... Perhaps, for this child,
it's better that way... Shizune, how is Yuukimaru? He'll live. He's still asleep... Thank goodness he made it. Yeah... But... I wasn't able to help him
at all in the end... What? I foolishly told him "wherever someone
thinks about you is the place to return to..." But right before his eyes,
he lost that very place to return to. That wasn't your fault. But still... You are the one I should return to,
after all... And I'm the one
you should return to, Guren. I promise you...
I will never leave your side. I will always think of you. Uh-huh...
And I will always think of you, Guren. From now, and forever... Naruto... I'm sorry. Yuukimaru... And that is the situation, Lady Tsunade. I see... I understand. Katsuyu, order everyone to return. Are you sure? We have no choice. It would be impossible to
have them continue their mission. Now that the child has lost his powers, Orochimaru can no longer
do anything to the Tailed Beast. We'll pull back for now, regroup,
and come up with a new plan. But Orochimaru is not the only one
who is after the Three-Tails... I'm perfectly aware of that. But the Three-Tails is an adversary
that has given us a great deal of trouble up to this point. Even the Akatsuki won't
have an easy time. I'll send Ninja to
replace them immediately. Once they arrive,
have them tell everyone to withdraw! Right away. Those are Lady Tsunade's orders. Understood. We'll inform everyone immediately. We have new orders from Lady Hokage. We will abort our current mission. Our orders are to return to
the village immediately. - What?
- Huh?! That was sudden. Hey c'mon, is it okay to leave
the Three-Tails? We won't have to worry about that. They're sending Ninja to replace us
and maintain the watch. But still...! There's nothing we can do
even if we remain here. Everyone has suffered too many wounds. Lady Tsunade has decided that
it would be more effective if we brought back the information
we've gained this time around and apply it to our next plan instead. We'll move out tomorrow morning. I want you all to get a good night's rest
before we move out. Guren... Guren... Gozu? Why're you... Why're you saving me...? Do you remember...that day? I was placed in solitary after losing control
during Orochimaru's experiment... I was hardly given any water
or food to speak of. I was on the verge of dying from thirst. Then you came and kindly gave me
a ladleful of water. Because of that, I was able to survive. Ever since that day, I... I don't even remember.
I must've been feeling generous. Even if that were so,
I've always admired you since then... Guren... O-Ow... Huh?! Yuukimaru?! Damn! Senpai. Damn! Where could he have gone?! His body's... in no condition to...! Yuukimaru... Damn! A grass whistle? Could it be Yuukimaru?! Come back! Yuukimaru--! Yuukimaru!
Where are you, Yuukimaru?! Damn! It's my fault...! Yuukimaru... This is...! Why would he leave behind something
as important as...? There isn't even a single crack... I see. So that's it... Yuukimaru disappeared? How could he even move
in his condition? Hey, Naruto.
You were in the room with him. Didn't you notice? No, I guess not. Huh?! How can you call yourself
a Ninja?! Just what you'd expect from a Genin! Shut up!
You were asleep, too, you know! Why you...! Don't put me in the same league
as a stamina freak like you! Arguing won't do any good! But I'm worried about Yuukimaru. He has nowhere to go, and... We can't just ignore him!
Let's all look for him! I agree! That won't be necessary. The reason is... because a child who lost his power
to control the Three-Tails is no longer a threat to us. That's not the issue here! No, Shino is right. We're under no obligation to look
for a child who ran away. And besides,
we've been ordered to return. But that's...! Are you okay with that, Naruto?! Yeah, there's nothing to worry about. He can handle himself. Naruto...? We'd better be on our way. Sorry to keep you all waiting, Kakashi. I was hoping we could have
shaken up the Akatsuki... I'm sorry. I didn't count on
the Leaf Ninja interfering. And so, did that woman... Guren die? Regretfully, yes. She possessed very interesting powers... Like you mean that... Maybe you were the one who killed her? Heaven forbid. Well, never mind. We can find any number of replacements
for someone of her ability. But Yuukimaru... Leave it. At this point... Lord Orochimaru! I'll bring your medicine right away! That host body has reached its limit... At this point, it has lost all meaning... Because soon,
I will possess his  body... What's the matter, Naruto? No, it's nothing... Is that the regular report? Yeah... A fog is forming. According to the unit we're taking over for, it's apparently created by
the Three-Tails. It induces hallucinations, so be careful. That's news to me, hmm... You! That costume... Dam--! Humph... Oh wow! Deidara Senpai,
that was awesome! That's the last of the lookouts. Your info was way off. "A force separate from
the Leaf Ninja was engaged in a vigorous clash over the Three-Tails." Wasn't that what you said? Well, that's how it was supposed to be...
That's odd. But oh well, it's good that we got rid
of the ones in our way. Let's make our quota right now
while we have the chance! You're a hundred years too young
to be giving me orders, hmm... H-H-Hey, Senpai! Weren't you listening to the story
about the hallucinations? Who do you think you're speaking to? Don't underestimate my art. Sheesh, he's got a short temper... That's a huge lake to find
the Three-Tails in. It'd be faster if it appeared on its own. Oh! On closer inspection,
it looks something like a huge turtle. A powerful one... So that's the Three-Tails... I think I'll leave it for you to handle,
Deidara Senpai. Tobi, you formally became
a member of Akatsuki, right? You take care of the rest, hmm! No way... It's coming! If it's a water creature,
shouldn't we have let Kisame handle it?! I'd say they assigned
the wrong person for the job! Pitiful, I'd say. Now! Is something the matter? No... It appears everyone has entered
the Land of Fire safely. I see. Good work. You may now return, Katsuyu. Yes. I did it! Banzai! Banzaai! Deidara, did you see my Jutsu?!
Just one time, and bam! You can understand why
I was given this important assignment right after formally becoming a member
of Akatsuki, can't you?! No... It was probably my clay bomb
doing its artistic work. You have my artistry to thank, hmm. Don't get so carried away that
you forgot that I lent you a hand! If you're a member of Akatsuki,
don't talk so much and act more cool. In other words, "cool = art"! Listen, art is a passionate moment
coming from cool emotions--! Senpai, you talk a lot. I was joking...! What is it? It's just that... contact from the unit that headed for
the lake is rather late, don't you think? Let's file a report, just in case. Listen, Tobi. You shouldn't press your luck! The Three-Tails was just weak
because it didn't have a Jinchuriki host. It didn't have a mind to control its power. Hey, Tobi. You don't have to be so cool
as to stop talking altogether. At least answer me... Hmm?! Oh that's the spot... Oh my... This is the perfect wake up
for you, I'd say. You bastard! Wow, it feels like I hadn't
been back in ages. We had one mission after another... Dinner tonight is at Ichiraku! Say, Naruto. Huh? About Yuukimaru...
Are you sure it was best that way? You used to worry so much about him. That's okay. Besides, even if we went looking for him,
he wouldn't be easy to find anyway. What do you mean? The Pervy Sage's words
were true, after all. He said wherever someone cares
about you is the place you return to. If you believe, and keep thinking,
about that person... your feelings will surely get across, he said. What? Is this...what I think it is? So...we should keep thinking, too. We need to create a place
that Sasuke can return to. Right. So that's your move...
Just as I expected.

 You are weaker than me...

 There's no longer any need for me
to give you my body.

 You Uchiha fledgling...!

 If I hadn't been a fledgling,
you'd have had no chance at me, right?

 Silence!

 I don't like the way you do things.

 You continue to toy with others
for your own pathetic reasons...

 You make me sick!

 Next time: "The Serpent's Pupil"

 Tune in again!

 So close... Just a little more! Any moment now. The Chunin Exam...the Forest of Death...
three years have passed... You want our "Earth Scroll," don't you...? Okay, let's begin...
the struggle for the scroll. We'll put our lives on the line! The Genin who once feared
your menacing air has now matured, hasn't he...? The young Sharingan that child turned
at me had a fine look. If he's able to use the Sharingan
to that extent as his age, he gets a passing grade. No, with training, he can become
an outstanding gem, superior to Itachi. Yes, that is what convinced me... In addition to the trauma
he carries with him! Sasuke would seek me out for sure... looking for strength! That is why you gave him
a Curse Mark and also took steps to keep watch over the Chunin Exam
to see how he reacts. Are you talking about Anko? That was just a coincidence. Well...I was planning to threaten
the Leaf, anyway. If his Chakra was completely sucked out
by Yoroi's powers, Sasuke would be forced to use
the power of the Curse Mark... Now release it.
That sweet power of yours...! Dancing Leaf Shadow?! Take this! I'm not going...to let this thing...
swallow me up! Lions Barrage! Wonderful... What more can I say? The will to brush off the effects
of the Curse Mark and the way he made use of the Sharingan
in a desperate situation... Actual battle does indeed make
Ninja mature greatly. It was the right decision to make him
continue with the Chunin Exam. I suppose. He did well to improve that much... Chidori! Excellent... He did well! There was no reason to keep him with
the Leaf Ninja any longer... There's no one who can train him better
than I can... No one other than me, who can understand
the darkness in his heart... As well as paint him in your colors,
Lord Orochimaru...isn't that right? It's as though the destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village was an afterthought. It's time for me to prepare
the next medicine... so that you will be able to go through
the Reanimation Jutsu in perfect condition. I will give you a punishment
that is appropriate for you, who has become intoxicated by Jutsu
and allowed it to go to your head! I will take all of your Jutsu! Stop it! Seal! My arms can't move...! Damn geezer... Because of that,
my Jutsu was taken from me and the time of my reanimation
was postponed. But... All preparations are complete...
and the plan is in its final stage. The unexpected accident is
now but a trivial price to pay. Finally, your body will become mine... Sasuke! The Serpent's Pupil  

 What's the meaning of this! Why hasn't there been any reports from
the Anbu Black Ops surveillance team? Even though we got rid
of Orochimaru's men, the Three-Tails still remains
a huge threat! Anyway, send a squad to check it out
and make it the highest priority! Yes, ma'am! Everything I do is for my goal... No, I do it to clear away the darkness
that stands in the way of my goal. Lord Orochimaru! What are you doing, Kabuto...?! Are you all right, Lord Orochimaru? I'm fine...
That body will be mine shortly. I will be reanimated soon.
I feel great... You've reached your limit. In your condition, if I don't administer
a rank 10 medication, your body will... I will change medications. It will just take a minute. That menacing air... But his body
should already have passed its limit. But he hangs on by his sheer will... This is why I cannot leave
Lord Orochimaru's side. The Hokage... When you defeated
both giant heads of Kazekage... And when you were just one step away from
destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village... The legendary Sannin... When you were fighting Tsunade
and Jiraiya at the same time... You never looked so menacing...
so full of ambition, even then. But now, at this point... I am fearful of how much you've grown,
Lord Orochimaru. If all goes well, not only the Five Kage, but the entire continent will bow down
before you, Lord Orochimaru... When you obtain Sasuke's body... Chidori Stream! The report is reliable? Yes. According to the squad sent
to check that lake... The Anbu Black Ops stationed there
to do surveillance had disappeared along
with the Three-Tails. Hmm... I'm sorry. This happened because
I was unable to seal the Three-Tails... But, who could have done this? Someone who could handle the Three-Tails
in the short time since we lost contact... The Akatsuki?! The cost of reanimation is this pain.
But it's... nothing compared to the greatness
that I am gaining. The nature of this Chakra... But, I've never seen
this Change in Chakra Form before. Who is it?! You came...just as I thought you would. I have nothing more to learn from you. Even here before you... I think I can become heartless. You didn't kill all of them...
How naïve. There are others I'd rather kill. Unless you become heartless,
you will never defeat Itachi. When I stand before him, I'll be heartless,
whether I want to be or not. Orochimaru, you are weaker than me. There's no longer any need for me
to give you my body. You have some nerve...
you're still an Uchiha fledgling! If I hadn't been a fledgling,
you would've had no chance at me, right? You... were eyeing me,
trying to appraise this "fledgling" in the forest
during the Chunin Exams. Move! Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu! I want you...after all! So you put dibs on me. You thought you had me bound to you
with this... Come with us! If you come,
Lord Orochimaru will give you power! - Are you coming?
- Or not?! If this weak guy keeps dawdling,
I'm going to want to kill him. Just try to kill me! You're not the only one
Lord Orochimaru favors. We're bound to Lord Orochimaru in exchange for gaining powers
via the Curse Mark. We no longer have any freedom. To gain something,
we have to give something up. What is it you're after? Don't forget your goal. I want revenge. I was ready to give my body if it meant
I could attain my goal of revenge. You just wanted a Sharingan, right? But... Itachi didn't work out...
That's why you came after me, a fledgling. Isn't that right?
You who they called the Genius Sannin. But you turned out to be what they call
on the streets, "just an ordinary prodigy." You couldn't even live up to
the Uchiha name, much less surpass it. Even the best prodigy is only ordinary
against the Uchiha name. What you did... disgustingly trying to approach
the powers of the Uchiha by drowning yourself in drugs and
trying to overcome your body... It seems so shameless and comical to me,
who possesses that name. And what's more,
I don't like the way you do things. What is your goal? You hopped from hideout to hideout,
conducting experiments... Toying with life after life... Saying you were trying to
unravel the order of this world. You continued to toy with others for
your own stupid and selfish reasons... Why... Brother? To measure my own abilities. Measure your own abilities...? Is that all? Is that the only reason...
you killed everyone?! That's what's important. You make me sick! A snake with white scales...
so that is your true form... You conducted experiment
after experiment so that you could move
from body to body... and that's how you ended up? Now, Sasuke...
Give me your body! A snake that slithers on the ground
can only dream of flying through the air. You wanted it so badly that
you went after the fledgling in the nest... But you became targeted
as the prey instead... By the eyes of a hawk
soaring high above in the sky. Sasuke! The way Lord Orochimaru looks...
He won't last with only the medicine.

 He'll have to do the Reanimation Jutsu
tomorrow, or as soon as today...

 Of course... I wouldn't think Sasuke
would consent willingly...

 But no matter how much he resists,
there's no way he can escape.

 Even Sasuke can't resist that Jutsu...

 Next time: "Eye of the Hawk"

 Tune in again!  

 Sasuke! Eye of the Hawk

 What is this? Ah! How lucky of you to find this. It's the skin of a white snake. I've never...seen anything
like it before. Actually, neither have I. It's a rare item that
you almost never see. Why is it white? Well, I don't really know. No one really cares about
such things. But from times past, the white snake has been
a symbol of good luck and renewal. Good luck and renewal... It must be some sort of karma
for you to find it here. Perhaps your parents are
now reborn somewhere. Maybe someday...
you'll meet them when you're grown up. When would that be...? Who knows? I couldn't say. Nawaki...sure is eager. We're at war...after all. Tsunade's team has been...? Stop! Stop! Stop! I said, stop! That's enough! He's dead! Humans...are such fragile beings. Power that was not used in a lifetime
rests inside the human body. If we could release that power... Orochimaru Sensei! What is this? An amulet. An amulet...? This...? It's a very rare amulet for
good luck and renewal. Renewal? With this...? But...Orochimaru Sensei, no matter how earnest you are
about your research, you can't bring back the dead,
can you? Yes... Bringing the dead
back to life is difficult. But, I've grasped a clue
about regeneration. By activating their bodies, humans can become immensely
more powerful and heighten their regenerative powers too. I will share that power
with you some day, as well. Yes! Thank you very much,
Orochimaru Sensei! The Body Activating Jutsu
called the Curse Mark... How foolish!
There's a limit to unreasonable training! Beautiful... So this is the power of the Sharingan. No matter how many Ninja try
to enter this territory... No matter how hard they train,
they could never surpass the Uchiha. ENTRY RESTRICTED TRANSFER I understand... I understand the awesomeness
of this Jutsu... TRANSFER
But, it would take at least one month
to master this Forbidden Jutsu... How many years would it take
to master all the Jutsu that are here...? It's impossible to grasp all the Jutsu within the limited time
of a human lifespan... There would be a limit
even if I could extend my life via a Reanimation Jutsu... Once I die, everything would be lost... In order to grasp every Jutsu,
I would have to... Orochimaru! So it was you,
just as I suspected... Tell me! What were you doing here? You probably couldn't understand... You who puts the village
before your own reason. To me, the lifespan of
the human body is too short. Even if I were to be called a Hokage, once I die,
everything would end there. The Jutsu you're experimenting with...
It can't be...?! That very one...
the Immortality Jutsu! Can't you reconsider Orochimaru? Out of the question! How stupid can you be?! I'm so close... So close with my research. I will have everything. My vessel is neither this body,
nor the Leaf! To that end, I will use that organization
and anything else! A new member has arrived. Itachi Uchiha. You destroyed the Uchiha.
What brings you to the Akatsuki? One who possesses the precious Sharingan
appears before me... How lucky I am... I will have your body! Could it be...that I...
am under a Paralysis Genjutsu... What visual prowess... Marvelous... Orochimaru... Any Jutsu you use will have
no effect before these eyes. You've come. Now, let's go... My future lies in this child! It's over... That was too quick. Looks like it's beginning
to take effect... The body fluid of the giant white snake skin
vaporizes upon contact with the air and becomes an anesthetic. I am immortal. The likes of your Jutsu cannot kill me...! Now then... I shall have you now! What is this? This is...a different space inside my body. Here, the Transference Ritual will be held... We'll begin now. What visual prowess... Marvelous... This is almost like...that time... Those eyes... Those eyes will be mine at last...! He won't last with only the medicine... He'll have to do the Transference Ritual
as soon as today... But... It's hard to believe that
Sasuke would consent willingly... Well, even Sasuke can't resist that ritual... Why is Sasuke here?! That is the cast-off skin
of the giant snake... Does that mean the ritual
is already done? What's going on? Kabuto, is that you? Which one... are you now? Which one do you think? This is the Transference Ritual! He's showing me the memories
of the Transference Ritual! The ritual between the two
will be settled right now! What the--?! This...can't be... This is a place I created.
This is impossible...! Impossible! It can't be... This is my only...! Orochimaru... Any Jutsu you use will have
no effect before these eyes. You...should realize that by now. How...hideous... Sasuke's will is eroding the space! I'm not...going to let this happen! I am the immortal Orochimaru! Not here! I won't let this happen here! I am the one to unravel
the order of this world...! Everything...will be mine! The clouds are moving ominously... Almost like... A flaming sunset, like blood... What's the matter? No, it's nothing. Lord Orochimaru is dead. No... It's almost as if... I took over all that he was. Three years have passed since
he broke away all ties,

 suppressed his personal feelings
and trained himself,

 just so he can achieve his goal...

 Now is the time for him to take action
with Orochimaru's power.

 What awaits him, as he pushes his way
through the dark corridor?

 Light or darkness?

 Next time: "Zabuza's Blade"

 Tune in again

 Suigetsu... I will release you from
this place some day. I knew it was you... The fact that you're here must mean
you killed Orochimaru. Yeah. But never mind that.
Let's get you out of here. Free at last. Thank you, Sasuke. Suigetsu, you're the first. Come with me. Me, first? There are others then? Two others. I'm taking Jugo
from the northern hideout and Karin from the southern hideout. Are you sure about that? What is it? It's nothing...
Just that I don't like them. I can't get along with them...
At least, that's what I think. Sure, you picked me, but I wonder about choosing
those two, Sasuke. Enough with the rambling.
Put on your clothes. We're going. Ordering me around like a big shot, eh? Let me clarify the relationship
between you and me... All right? Sorry, but you chose  to rescue me. I never said anything about following you. Just because you defeated Orochimaru
doesn't make you better than me. Everyone was after him. You were Orochimaru's pet, so you weren't imprisoned
and you stayed by his side. You had more chances to kill him
than the rest of us. Gotcha... Just kidding. But I let you go just now,
so that makes us even. I'm free at last,
so I'm going to do as I please. I see. That's unfortunate. By the way... It was your team, wasn't it? The team that brought down
my great predecessor, Zabuza Momochi. Whatever happened to his blade...
the Executioner's Blade? Let's do this. If you tell me where the blade is,
and I take possession of it, then I'll be willing to help you. Put some clothes on. Zabuza's Blade

 GREAT NARUTO BRIDGE The Great Naruto Bridge? What a weird name... Say, was the great Zabuza Senpai strong? Everyone, duck! It's over. I'm not that naïve! Kakashi Sensei! Damn it! Guys like you aren't called "Ninja"... Just mere kids. What's the matter, Sasuke? Sasuke? Nothing. Let's go. It's not here. Say, Sasuke, are you sure it was here? Yeah. But it's not here. I wonder why? How would I know?
I'm not the keeper of that grave. If it's not there,
someone must've taken it. You're right about that.
It wouldn't have walked off on its own. Sasuke... Sorry, but without the blade here,
me joining you will have to wait. What'll you do then? What else? I'm gonna look for it. The blade of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist was passed down from generation to generation.
That was the system. I aspired to become one of them
and trained for it. Since Zabuza Senpai is gone... I'm the one who should possess
that Executioner's Blade. Watch where you're walking, you idiot! Huh? What? You have a problem, Bro? Ah...whatever... Just be careful! What's his problem, stupid...
jerk... old fart... idiot...?! You're so nice, Sasuke... So...how're you gonna settle this debt? Oh... This yogurt is the best. It's been so long since
I had anything like this. I was in a water tank all this time. Can you afford to relax like this? But...you're the one in a rush. Why're you gathering us
together anyway? I'll tell you when we've all assembled. "All right, let's go conquer this world!" You're not gonna say something
like that, are you? Do that on your own time. I'm aiming for...
something much bigger. If anyone else started saying that,
I wouldn't believe it for a second. But with you... I think maybe it's possible...
And that's the strange thing. Oh say...
The Great Naruto Bridge, was it? Ever heard of a large blade
near that bridge? Well... Oh, maybe there was... What about it? He's looking for that blade. Huh?! S-Someone might know about it...
I'll go and ask! Oh dear! SCREAMS You're quite the ladies' man, eh? I know! - Tazuna...
- Who lives by the riverside... ...would know! Tazuna...huh? Who is this Tazuna? The carpenter boss who built that bridge. The boss isn't here right now. Do you know where he went? To the Land of Lightning to build a bridge.
He took Inari with him. He won't be back for another year. The Land of Lightning, eh?
That's very far. Do you know of a large blade that
was left near the Great Naruto Bridge? Oh, that. Tenzen Daikoku took it. He originally came here to capture
the Ninja who wielded the blade. But after learning the Ninja was dead,
he took the blade with him instead. Damn it... Tenzen Daikoku, eh? He was the aide to
the lord of the Land of Water. Apparently, many of his men were killed during Zabuza Senpai's coup d'état
in the Hidden Mist. I guess he had a grudge from back then. Where the hell...
do you think you're--?! Hey, we were just looking for you. Wh-Who are you guys?! You seem like the type to know
all kinds of things... I know nothing about Tenzen! Anything will do.
Just tell us what you know. T-Tenzen Daikoku is a politician... But there's another side to him. He's the boss of a huge band of thieves. I hear he doles out huge bribes
to the feudal lords, and gets to do whatever
evil things he likes. See, you know it all. And?
Where does he live? Just to the south...
there's a castle in the forest. Rumor says several thousand mercenaries
guard the place and that it's impenetrable. Wh-Who's there? How did you get in?! The day after tomorrow, this castle will be attacked by
tens of thousands of soldiers. Make sure you gather
every man available. My name...is Suigetsu. An intruder! Men! Come out! Cripes... What's going on? It seems another powerful clan plans
to attack Tenzen's castle tomorrow with an army that numbers
in the tens of thousands. Oh... is that true? Oh well, whatever. The more confused the enemy becomes,
the better my chances. Be it several thousand
or tens of thousands, it doesn't matter to a Ninja like me. I'll sneak in tonight and
take the Executioner's Blade. How about making a wager? A wager...? On who gets
the Executioner's Blade first... Huh?! I never expected you
to have a playful side! Let's do it. It sounds like fun. Then it starts now. There's only one rule.
We don't kill anyone. Huh? Who the hell are you?! You're suspicious! You mean... Now as in...? It really starts now, huh? I can't lose this wager.
Well, all right, let's do it. Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Gotta hand it to you, Sasuke! What the--?! He's gone?! Is this for real?! Damn, may as well get started! This is tiring, after all. Finally, my goal. Impossible... You defeated
all those men by yourself?! Well yeah. Even with legitimate weapons,
attacking me is useless. If legitimate weapons are of no use...! How about...this?! Say, that's my Executioner's Blade. Ah, you did it! You let down your guard at the very end. Sorry. Blades don't work on me... You see? But I'm jealous. You're able to wield that blade
without any special training... It helps when you have a good physique. I hear you've been telling
everyone in town... That you killed the Demon Zabuza
and took that blade from him. Th-That wasn't me...
It was Lord Tenzen who... Hmm... So you killed Zabuza Senpai? N-No... The one who killed Zabuza was... Zabuza? Err...no! The one who killed Mr. Zabuza
wasn't me... You're...the one...from yesterday! He's the one!
He's the one who killed Mr. Zabuza! All I did was bring the blade
back from the grave! I'll give you some points for that. That's a pretty good lie for a villain
like you to come up with. Suigetsu! How thoughtful.
I was feeling a bit dehydrated. I think you're under
the wrong impression here. I wasn't particularly close to Mr. Zabuza. But the thought of my Senpai
from my village... ...having such pathetic rumors about
losing to weaklings like you is... You know...? D-Do you think you can
get away with this?! Well, you'll have to pay for this...right? I think I'll test it on you. Forget it. What's the sense
in killing someone like him? I've cut through the main pillars,
so you'd better get out of here. I'll spare your life. Out of respect for you, Sasuke. Sasuke? Not that...?! Sasuke who killed Orochimaru?! Say, you're famous.
They know your name even around here. As long as I have this blade,
I won't even lose to you...maybe. Say... You knew that I was going
to claim this blade, didn't you? And...You knew from the start
that the blade wasn't in that grave... I see... The one who warned that castle
to gather its men... was you? Tenzen acted like he'd met you before. Hey? Did you suggest a wager just
to lure me into enemy territory? Were you just testing me? Man, you're terrible.
What if I was hurt? Well, I understand now...
what kind of guy you are. And you're exactly the way
I imagined you to be. Anyway, I have my blade.
So I'll help you as promised. So? Which way do we go? Oh wait... The nearest route, right?
That would be your answer. I'm starting to figure you out... Right, the nearest route. Just because Orochimaru
is dead doesn't mean I'll let you have your way! The feeling of this Chakra...
I-It can't be... Say... Why are you gathering men?

 I have a goal...

 And I have a better chance of
achieving it with a small team.

 But still,
I don't know about choosing Karin...

 Unlike me,
she's a follower of Orochimaru.

 Not to mention her personality...

 But, her power is special...

 Well... That I'll have to agree with you on.

 Next time: "Guardian of the Iron Wall"

 Tune in again!

 Can I ask you something? What is it? Why are you gathering men? I have a goal... And I have a better chance of
achieving it with a small platoon. Ever since I approached Orochimaru,
this moment is all I've thought about, and I've been pre-selecting
highly skilled Ninja. Oh...? So...why would you choose Karin? Unlike me,
she's a follower of Orochimaru... The warden of the southern hideout where Orochimaru kept
his test subjects locked up. After claiming to be
under Orochimaru's orders, she tinkered with
my body countless times. Besides, her personality turns me off. Granted, there were other strong Ninja
I could have swayed. But she has a special power
no one else possesses. Well... I'll admit that. A nice smell...and a bad odor. There's hardly any security
in this hideout. They should at least build a fence. She has this place under control.
There's no need. Still, it's too quiet. You'd think that word of
Orochimaru's death had already reached this place... You have one too. That one is more suitable. Open sesame! Say, I've been thinking. That rumor must be true-- Shut up! You know what happened to
the others who brought that up... Yeah... you're right... Oh, damn it... That's Sasuke Uchiha! What's he doing in a place like this? It's been quite a while
since he came here with Orochimaru. Yeah, why didn't he come
with Orochimaru? He's with a guy
we've never seen before... Maybe that rumor is true...!
About Orochimaru being dead. That's it!
Sasuke must've killed Orochimaru! And he's come to free us all! Idiot. Like that'll ever happen! Besides, Orochimaru would
never get killed. So it's you, after all...Sasuke. Guardian of the Iron Wall

 Sasuke... The fact that you're here alone
must mean that the rumors were true. Geez, that's mean. I'm here too. And? What brings you here? Sasuke has something
to discuss with you. We can't stand out here and talk,
so take us inside, will you? It's been so long since I've walked...
I'm exhausted. What do you want to talk about? I said let's not stand out here, Karin. Although I know
you're totally ignoring me. Humph! You disgust me. What'd you say? Cut it out, Karin. Take us inside. Fine. Karin, follow me. I need you. Huh?! Why would I follow you?
I'm under orders to oversee this place! Orochimaru is already gone. What about the prisoners here? Speaking of prisoners,
they were awfully quiet. Have the rumors about
Orochimaru's death reached them? The number of prisoners has slightly
lessened since I came here last. Also, there are signs of recent digging
in the grounds in front of the entrance. Karin, with that sharp intellect,
information control must be your forte. I get it. Rumors about Orochimaru's death
began spreading among the prisoners, so in order to avoid a riot,
Karin has been wisely taking action... Is that it? Hey, do you know about
that rumor? Yeah, I know.
About Orochimaru being killed, right? Yeah. You planted a spy among the inmates and if anyone began gossiping
about Orochimaru... Karin, it's your cautious nature which
maintained order in the prison. Or rather...kept you alive. You'd better stop talking like that! You've been trained by Orochimaru,
all right. Man, you're scary. You probably sensed
our presence long ago. You could've even killed us by now. If you were alone. But not Sasuke? I didn't say that!
Sasuke is a colleague. I wanted to see if
the rumors were true... that Sasuke killed Orochimaru. I did kill him. How can you say that so casually?! Suigetsu... Release everyone
who is held prisoner here. Wha--?! Geez... You always
order people around. You can't just come here
and take over! You don't know what it took
to keep things in order here... Without prisoners,
there won't be any need for a warden. I'll say it once more.
Come with me, Karin. What'll you do? Well, anyway,
I'll go and release the prisoners. I refuse! Besides... I'm under no obligation to follow you! Too bad... Since you seem dead set against it,
I'll just ask someone else. I knew it! The rumors that Sasuke Uchiha
brought down Orochimaru were true! Yeah, it's true. What'll happen to those of us in here? Of course, you're free to go. A-Are you sure?! Yeah... I was once imprisoned too.
But as you can see, I'm free. I'm going to unlock the cells.
Before that, I have one favor to ask. What is it?! Ask us anything! Well... The one who defeated Orochimaru
and gave us our freedom is Sasuke. When you're out,
spread the word to everyone... A man has appeared who will
bring peace and tranquility to this world. I'm coming. Since you're so adamant... I'll go with you. What's this?
That was a quick change of heart. After thinking it over, I realized I'm tired of
guarding this place. It's locked from the inside... That woman! That's Suigetsu. Let's forget about that nuisance,
okay, Sasuke? You... Don't get so close. Look...what's wrong with
just you and me? We don't need a guy like...Suigetsu. Your cunning and sense of caution... and especially your power
to sense Chakra... From the moment I met you,
I knew I could use you. Yes...that time... Lord Orochimaru sent me here.
To assist you, Sasuke Uchiha. Two hours ago, 118 test subjects
escaped from the hideout. Judging from the time,
they are all still in this forest. I understand that this order
is to capture them dead or alive. Yeah. Well then, let's begin. 50, 60... 70...80...90...100! Found them! I'll start with the ones hiding
closest to us. There's one fifty meters behind us. And four more in front of us
at ten o'clock. So fast! Can you keep up? It's my duty. Karin, become my eyes. D-Don't give me orders! Three are hiding over at 1:30. And from that point, at nine o'clock, there are five more waiting
to ambush us. How many? This one makes 84. Sasuke, why don't you kill them? You're so lenient. There's only one man
I have a desire to kill. Wh-What...?! This guy's...Chakra...! This guy...is cool! Karin! Karin! You did that...for me? If I were to lose you, capturing
the escapees would become difficult. I know! At that moment... I... Sasuke... Sasuke, I... Hope my blade isn't chipped... Let's go, Sasuke.
Karin turned you down, didn't she? No. It seems she's coming. Wh-Who said I'm coming?! I just... I just happened to be
going in the same direction. That's all, nothing else...! Oh, how nice.
Then we can travel together partway. Yeah, just part of the way! All right... Next is Jugo. What? You're going to see Jugo? That shouldn't concern you since you're just coming
with us part of the way. Sure, I could care less,
but what's wrong with asking? Wanna make something of it,
you jerk?! Let's go! Y-Yeah... I'll go! Sasuke Uchiha... He always looks so calm and cool... This feeling...is exciting. Of the hundreds, the thousands
I've encountered, his Chakra is the best... It grabs you! Compared with that... What?! Your Chakra...bothers me. Huh? I could say the same about yours. No, a woman... A woman is nice... No, wait. A guy? I guess a guy is better... No... A woman...? A woman... No... Maybe a guy... We have to keep walking?
I'm exhausted.

 We're about to go to
the northern hideout.

 If you're acting like that, you'll be killed
the moment you arrive there.

 I didn't realize the place
is so dangerous.

 Yeah, the northern hideout is
no ordinary hideout.

 What do you mean by that?

 The place is
a human experiment facility.

 Intolerably bad monsters were
created there and kept under restraint.

 Next time:
"Jugo of the Northern Hideout"

 Naruto Uzumaki's Swirling Radio!
Our guest today is... Hello, I'm Kakashi Hatake. Getting right to the point, can you stop ad-libbing
during rehearsals? What? I'm just trying to
keep everyone calm. Well, you sure seem to enjoy it. Th-That's just an act! Oh yeah? Well, whatever. Here's a postcard from
"Super Beast Scroll." "I've been thinking about
a nickname for Kakashi Sensei." "How about Pervy Hedgehog?" There goes my dignity... And moving on to "Sparkling Maiden." "I'll get right to the point!
Aren't you going to get married?" "Also, your habit of always being late
when your team assembles. "That's very rude." "Finally, please don't read
your smut books in front of us. "To put it bluntly,
that's sexual harassment." - Kakashi Sensei?! What's wrong?
- Man... Kakashi Sensei!
Will you come back again? I'll never come again!! Tune in again!

 We have to walk again? I'm exhausted. Humph... We're going to
the northern hideout now. At this rate, you'll be killed
the moment we get there. I only know it through maps...
but is the place really that bad? The northern hideout
is no ordinary hideout. That place... is where human experiments
are conducted. And the unmanageable monsters that
result are kept locked up there. A male... No, a female. No, I'll kill a male next, after all. I see. It's already begun... Why... Why did you have to die? RAMEN  
That's pretty heavy food
to have in the morning. Sakura, today's our day off.
How come you're up so early? It's already noon. Well, never mind. Just wash up quickly and get dressed.
I'll be waiting. Huh? Is it a date? Idiot! Lady Tsunade has summoned us! Say, aren't you tired? How about a short break? You're already taking a break! You are so hopeless! We've still got a ways to go 'til
we get to the northern hideout! My destination is different
from yours. No need to bother with me.
Just go on ahead. I remembered that I too have business
at the northern hideout! So I'm going to take care of that first! Move...! I'll kill you too! Stop it, Jugo... That's... enough. You're not alone. You have me. Without you... I can never leave this place... Suigetsu... Why do you follow Sasuke? I have a goal. And if I stick with Sasuke,
I can fulfill that goal. Say, I should be asking you
the same question... Really. I don't know what your goals are... But you want me to join your team
despite knowing about Jugo? I know him a little.
We fought each other once. He had an unusual ability
and was quite formidable. But I couldn't figure out
what he was thinking, and I didn't really like him. I understand he  sought out
Orochimaru. He's got to be crazy. According to rumors, Jugo usually has that
unusual impulse well under control. But when he loses it,
he transforms into a ruthless killer. His personality and appearance
change completely. In other words, he's a maniac
who loves to kill people. But to Orochimaru,
Jugo's ability was enticing. He invented an enzyme,
based on Jugo's body fluids, which induced the same condition
in other Shinobi. You guys know it too, right? That's...the Curse Mark. Jugo is the one and only
original carrier. I'm getting out of here!
I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me! Who's...next? Jugo of the Northern Hideout

 You're late! What took you two so long?! Cripes! I-I'm sorry. Naruto was eating lunch,
which he calls breakfast... Now now... Tsunade... Huh? Pervy Sage?! You're back! It's been awhile, eh, Naruto? Aw man! Why didn't you tell me
you were back? We had a hard time after you left. So I hear. I got the gist of it, but I understand
you played a big part. That's for sure. I finally got my Collaboration Jutsu
to work in sync with the two toads. Oh, is that so?! You finally did it! How about it?
Wanna see my new Jutsu? Well, since I'm here...
I don't mind if I do. I knew it! And naturally, after that,
we'll go eat ramen at Ichiraku! Sure, it'll be my treat. - All right! Let's get going!
- Let's go! Your new Jutsu, eh...? - I'm looking forward to this...
- Hey!! - Ow!
- Oh! Say, can we rest a bit? Suigetsu! You keep stopping to rest! We're almost at the hideout! Is it the sword?
Is it too heavy for you? Then leave it, damn it! Tell him, Sasuke! What's wrong? Where's the guy who's on watch? Huh? You're right... That's strange. Hey... He's from the northern hideout.
He's still breathing. What happened? Y-You're...Sasuke Uchiha... Help me... What happened? I-It all started... with the rumors that
Orochimaru was dead. The prisoners went wild... At this rate... Oh dear... He died. You're... What is that? He's already in the
"Curse Mark Second State." The northern hideout is over there. Let's go and see Jugo. Huh? Hey! Wait, Sasuke! Huh? Who is this guy? A male... The next one I kill
will be a guy, after all... All right, decided. If the next one who comes
through that door is a woman, I'll kill her. The guards have all been killed... and the prisoners have escaped. Then there's no way
we can tell which one is Jugo... Eh, Sasuke? Karin, is Jugo among them? Cripes, what a pain!
Just wait a bit! Nope, he's not. Well then, I can fight without
worrying who they are. Just avoid killing them. You're from the Hidden Leaf,
after all... You should've killed that
guy back there too, you know. So naïve... Let's go. Stay away! You all stink! You're strong... You're... The keys! I found them! Kill... Kill... Karin, which way?
Lead the way. Sasuke!
Why're you ordering me around, huh?! Can you just hurry and check? That's the ability you
pride yourself on, right? That way! What is it? Actually, it's this way. Let's go, Sasuke! Why did you lie? Suigetsu went... Suigetsu has a big mouth,
that's why I don't like him. Let's go! Let go... I can walk on my own. So...the Curse Mark really does transform
the body into such an ugly shape... Sasuke, does your Curse Mark
do the same to you? Sasuke... Are you listening...? That witch...! A woman... If a woman enters, I'll kill her...! Here? Yeah, Jugo's inside. There... Now then, which will it be? All right! I'm gonna open it! I'll go in first. Karin, stay back. S-Sure! No... It's gotta be a guy.
If it's a guy, I'll kill him. Bingo! I'm gonna kill! He's coming! Huh? I'm back where I started. I should've turned right back there. Damn that witch! Y-You guys... Just what is your purpose
in coming here? We came to take Jugo outta here,
so that he can join our team. Do you guys realize...
what you're doing? If you let that guy...
out into the world... I totally agree. But I'll convince him...
with force, if necessary. You may be strong, but you're hardly... Listen... If it weren't for Sasuke's words,
you'd be dead right now. Jugo will kill you all! I really could care less
if one person died. Sasuke! I-I'm so sorry!
Naruto always gets so rowdy... Hey, Naruto, you idiot!
Say you're sorry too!! Oww... Sakura that hurt! And? What did you want
to talk about? Huh? Mmm... What's wrong, Granny Tsunade? Don't you have something
to talk about? Well... There's certain information that is
being spread throughout the region... It's about that. Information? What? What about? Orochimaru is dead. It seems Sasuke Uchiha killed him. Is... Is that...true? There's no mistake about it.
I heard it from a reliable source. Then... Heh! After all, there's no way
he'd get killed by Orochimaru! That means Sasuke will be coming back
to the Hidden Leaf! Right? That doesn't seem to be the case... It's not over yet! Sasuke's Chakra... ...changed! Not another copy of me...! Sasuke... But you're quite a guy to be able to do
a Partial Transformation! You're good at controlling
your Curse Mark! I have no intention of fighting. I only wish to talk to you, Jugo. But you're quite a guy!

 You're good at controlling
your Curse Mark!

 I have no intention of fighting.
I only wish to talk to you.

 Talk?

 Jugo, I'm getting you out of here.

 Are you an idiot?!
You don't know anything!

 What do you mean?

 He's gone. That's why...

 I can never leave this place!

 Next time: "Formation!"

 Captain Yamato gave me
some raffle tickets! Naturally, I'm going for first prize... A year's supply of Cup Noodles!! Huh? This must be it. RAFFLE TICKET BOOTH
Welcome...!
Oh, it's just you, Naruto. Don't give me that attitude! By the way,
are my cup noodles still here? Whether it's yours or not
depends on your luck. FIRST PRIZE


But, no first-prize winners yet! All right!! Okay. You get three tries. Come on ramen! Sorry! Here's a candy for
drawing a blank. Damn it! Next one for sure! You lose! Here's your second candy. I'm putting everything
on this last try! - Oh!
- Oh! Jack pot!! Yay! - Here.
- Huh?! Grand prize is
the Make-Out Tactics Book Set signed by Master Jiraiya! What?! Who needs this?! This is stupid! I'm going home! GRAND PRIZE


Huh? They already won the grand prize? And here I got these raffle tickets... How depressing! Tune in again!

 Sasuke's Chakra... ...changed! Not another copy of me! Sasuke... But you're quite a guy to be able to do
a Partial Transformation! You're good at controlling
your Curse Mark! He's strong! Haven't seen a copycat
this good since Kimimaro. I have no intention of fighting. I only wish to talk to you, Jugo. Talk...?! I'm getting you out of here. Get me out of here?! Are you crazy?! Without him... Without him... I can't...leave this place. Stop! Please stop! Oh...guys... How have you been? Kid, where are you going? If you value your life,
don't go beyond this point. A demon lives there. A demon? He's known as "Bipolar Jugo." Look at that. Because of Jugo,
no one lives in that village, to this day. No one's ever gotten close to him
and come back alive. I don't mean to lecture you.
But you should go back. What? You've followed me? But stop where you are.
You must not come. Now, go back to your own home. Don't come near me! Go away! If you come here, I'll kill you! I'll kill anyone who comes in here! Who is it? Go away! Go away! I said to go away! I'll kill you... Kimimaro... Formation! 

 I'll say it once more.
I have no intention of fighting. I came to get you out of here. Come with me. I can't leave here anymore! Sasuke! Just kill that guy...Sasuke! As if I'll let you get away! Geez! What is this place?! You're mean!
You tricked me, didn't you? You went and got lost on your own. I just followed your directions! Are you accusing me of tricking you?! How would I benefit from
tricking you anyway? You can be alone with Sasuke. A-As if I'd want such a thing...! Umm... I mean... Well, whatever.
But what's going on here? Jugo went wild... So the two of you went to Jugo,
after all. Where's Sasuke? He went out with Jugo. Well, it's Sasuke.
He won't get beaten that easily. I wonder... So Jugo has gotten strong...? You could say that... By the way, you said that he willingly
came to Orochimaru, right? Yeah... Why? To reform himself. Reform himself...? It's possible that...for Jugo, Orochimaru's hideout was like
a sanctuary. What does Jugo wish to be
reformed from? It's like an addiction... He can't do anything about it
on his own. Huh? He wanted to suppress his urge to kill. Kill! You don't understand...! I can no longer escape from this place! I'll kill you too! I see... Your strength is amazing... I thought I was a goner. Wh-Who are you...? Kimimaro... I came in search of you. Would you...
like to go to Lord Orochimaru too? Orochimaru...? There are many people with
Lord Orochimaru that are just like you and I... You're all alone, aren't you? If you go to Lord Orochimaru,
you won't be alone anymore. I'm not normal.
I can't control myself. There's no telling when I'll start killing
the people around me. I won't get killed. I'm not that weak. Aren't you...afraid of me? No, I'm not, Jugo. I will become your cage... As long as I'm by your side...
your spirit will be free. I'll beat you to death! Huh? Is that...true? Yes. I'm going to absorb the enzyme
from your body into my own. Just like you,
I will possess the power of the Curse Mark. Hold on a minute. The Curse Mark doesn't adapt
to just anyone. If it doesn't adapt... I know... At that moment, I'll die. If you know, then stop this! It's part of the treatment. My body is being eaten away
by disease. Perhaps your Curse Mark
will slow its progress. Your power will save me. Don't worry so much. It's all right. We're best friends. There is no way your power
will reject me. Kimimaro...why did you... Why did you...leave me and die! What?! You're using a different technique
than before, Jugo. It's solid. Stop it, Suigetsu. That's right! You're Suigetsu. I remember now. This guy is dangerous,
after all, Sasuke. Sasuke...? We didn't come here to fight. Let me talk to him. I doubt that anything
you say will get through to him. You just have to take him by force! Stop it, both of you! Keep going! Just kill each other off! Do you both...want me to kill you? Just now...that was real bloodthirst. Y-You're irresistible...Sasuke... H-Hurry up and lock me in! Jugo... I only came to free you. Come with me. He's too scared. No... That's not it. I don't want to kill anymore people. I don't want to go outside...
Leave me alone! What is this?
Talk about split personality... I told you so...
Jugo has this uncontrollable urge to kill. He's unable to suppress the urge even though he really doesn't want
to kill people. I don't know when
I'll kill someone again. So just put the lock on! See, this guy is dangerous, Sasuke. I can't even walk in front of him
without getting nervous. What's with you guys?!
Just leave me alone! Orochimaru is dead. And this hideout has been destroyed. If you stay here, you'll die as well. That's fine with me...
I don't want to kill anyone ever again! Don't worry...
I will become your cage. I will stop you. What can you do? The only one who can make
these urges stop is Kimimaro. Without Kimimaro, I won't leave! Kimimaro? You mean
of the Kaguya clan...? Yeah... Jugo and Kimimaro were
especially favored by Orochimaru. They were kept together in this hideout
for human experiments for a long time. Plus, Kimimaro was strong... Jugo was valuable for
human experiments and Kimimaro was the only one able to
stop Jugo's rampages without hurting him. But I thought that guy was already... Yeah... Jugo... Kimimaro died for my sake. He's no longer here. Died for your sake?! Then you're... Sasuke Uchiha...? Yes. Sasuke... Uchiha... Why are you being sent out?
You're sick! This has never happened before... Sasuke Uchiha... The man who is taking my place
as Lord Orochimaru's vessel... It's to bring him in. Is he worth going that far? If you take me out of the running
as a vessel, then there is no one else. He is like my reincarnation. I will risk my life to bring him here. I'm grateful to you, Jugo. Your power made me much stronger. Well Jugo... I'll be back again. Is that how it is...Kimimaro. Now... I have all the members I had in mind. So I will tell you my goal. My goal is to kill Itachi Uchiha
of the Akatsuki. Thought so... Itachi Uchiha...?
But that's his brother! And I want to borrow your strength for that. Naturally, I won't force you. Karin... You said you had business
to take care of. What will you do? W-Well... On second thought,
it's not that urgent... Karin... Be honest with yourself. Isn't being with Sasuke
all you really want? Th-That's not true!
Whoever said such a thing? That's...! I...!! See, I hit it right on the mark. That's why you're speechless.
So obvious. I know all about it... Long ago...
you had a crush on Sasuke... Suigetsu, don't get Karin so worked up... I thought I told you to be cooperative. All right... Sorry, Karin. But as much as you hate it... I'm sticking to Sasuke like glue. At least until I possess one
of the Seven Hidden Mist Blades... Kisame Hoshigaki's
Great Shark Fin sword. So you're just sword collecting?
How lame... Suigetsu... I know. Jugo, what about you? Kimimaro used to say that
you were his reincarnation, Sasuke... And he bet his life to protect you. So I want to see with my own eyes just how great of a Ninja you are. Then it's all set! What's the matter with him? Orochimaru is dead,
so why isn't he returning to the village? Sasuke is possessed by
the desire for revenge. He intends to approach the Akatsuki in order to kill his older brother Itachi. That guy!
Is he still...? Dammit! From this point on, we move together. And henceforth,
we will call ourselves... Hebi. Well, let's get going. Operation "Track Akatsuki"
is still ongoing, right? Yes... If we hunt down that
Akatsuki member first we'll definitely run into
Sasuke eventually! Hebi has but one objective... In other words, our target is... Itachi... Uchiha! I'll tell you a story from
when I was still just a kid.

 It was during the final days of
the Third Great Ninja War.

 Due to the long war with other nations,

 the Leaf was suffering from
an unprecedented lack of war capability.

 It was during such time
when that incident occurred.

 It was my first mission as a Jonin.

 Next time: "Kakashi Chronicles~
A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 1"

 Lady Katsuyu, may I ask you a question? Yes? How did you get here? Oh, that was... So, please join Sakura
as soon as possible. As soon as possible... Everyone is waiting for you! Understood. However, I can't walk that fast... Oh no!! This is nothing, they're all waiting... Ah, the sunlight... the dryness... Oh no! It's a slug monster! Get me some salt, salt! Please wait, I'm not... You went through all
that trouble for us...?! Oh no, my effort was nothing
compared to yours. Not at all!
We didn't know any of that... Here, Naruto. Come here and
apologize to her with me! Whoa, for what? You too, Sai!! Just kidding. Actually Lady Tsunade sent me here
using the transportation technique. Sakura still has a lot to learn. Tune in again! 

 ~Thanks for watching on Crunchyroll.com~ Kakashi Chronicles
~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 1

 This is bad! At this rate, I'll be killed! Can I make it?! Did I make it? No, Obito, you're late! What time did you think
we were supposed to meet?! If you're a full-fledged ninja you're expected to follow the rules! Well... I was on the way, but an old lady carrying a load
asked me for directions... And I got something in my eye... Okay! That's a lie, isn't it?! That's enough, Kakashi. Obito showed the old lady the way... Isn't that right? I carried her bag too! You're too lenient, Sensei. Besides, there's no way that
some needy person appears before Obito each and every time! Those who break the rules and
regulations are regarded as scum! Isn't that so?! Don't you have a shred of kindness
in your heart?! All you ever talk about are
rules and regulations! The main thing is
your own self-control. Now stop it, both of you.
We're all on the same team. You're too easy on Obito, Rin. This is an important day for me too. Y-You're right... What was it again? As of today, Kakashi is a jonin like me. And in order to increase
our efficiency, we'll be splitting into two teams. After all, presently the Leaf Village
is at an unprecedented low on military strength. Splitting up? Then... Yes, that's right. Kakashi will be captain of
a three-man squad with Obito and Rin. And I'll be working alone. Remember, we talked about
this the other day, Obito... About getting Kakashi a gift. Sorry... I wasn't listening. This is my gift.
A custom-made kunai knife. It's sort of heavy and odd-shaped, but once you get accustomed to it,
it's easy to use. Thank you. And this is from me. Here! A personalized special medkit... I adjusted things a little,
to make it easier to use. Thanks. Wh-What's with that hand? I don't have anything to give you! Well... I don't mind. It wouldn't have been anything
worthwhile anyway. Getting something useless
would only get in the way. I still can't figure out
why you became a jonin! You should talk. I'm Obito Uchiha of the  Uchiha clan! I'll surpass you some day!
The minute my "Sharingan" awakens! Everyone in the Uchiha clan
is elite, right? So you shouldn't have to rely
on something like that. What...?! Stop it, you two! Can I start to explain the mission
to you? We're close to the border. Got it? It's this line. It shows where the Land of Earth
is currently invading the Hidden Grass Village. Our enemies are
the Hidden Stone Ninja... We have received word that
1000 ninja already make up the front line. They've advanced considerably
since the last time. The Land of Fire shares borders
with the Hidden Grass. We should have stepped
in long ago. Judging by the size of this advance... they must have an efficient system
for reinforcement. Hence, our mission is here...
at Kannabi Bridge. To crush one's enemy at
the battlefront requires an immense number of ninja. So ninja like us,
who focus on sabotage missions, are forced to work in small, select teams. The bridge...you say? Then it's an infiltration mission? Right! Team Kakashi... Your mission is to infiltrate
the enemy's rear territory. You will destroy this bridge, which is used
to transport supplies and reinforcements. And when this is done,
withdraw immediately. - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! And you, Sensei? I will face the enemy directly
on the battlefront. I'll create a diversion for you. In any case,
Kakashi is your captain today. We'll travel together to the border, but after that your mission commences! - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! Nice...Kakashi. They noticed...
They're pretty good. He's... No, that can't be... I'll just watch the situation. One... No! Be on guard, everyone.
There are twenty of them. Although it's probably
a Shadow Clone Jutsu. I think you're right. Sensei...
I'll attack. Can you cover me? Don't be hasty, Kakashi.
I think you should back me up. Sensei... I'm the captain today! I want to test a new jutsu
I've been working on. He's coming... Chidori! What is that jutsu?! Wh-What an incredible chakra... Here I go! No matter what their numbers are, with this jutsu,
I can take them down in a flash. It's just like your nickname. Besides... Sensei... You said it yourself. Right now, I'm the captain. The rule says that the team must obey
its captain's orders, Sensei! To think he'd attack head on... Your kunai attacks helped me
pinpoint your location. Here I go! He's fast! Damn! It's a Shadow Clone...! Then on to the next! Don't let your guard down! Yes sir! That's number 18! Don't get cocky, brat! Kakashi! I was barely able to counter
that brat. But that yellow-haired guy's moves are... I marked him... Sensei's Transportation Technique is
...so fast! N-No way... Are you the
"Yellow Flash of the Leaf"?! Those of us from the Land of Earth... have been taught by our commanders
to run when we see you. I finally understand what they meant. Kakashi's wound is serious... We'll retreat and regroup. I'm all right! No, you're not! All because you ignored Sensei's warnings
and charged ahead! I don't need to listen to that. Not from the "Uchiha elite"
who was whining in fear back there! I-I got some dust in my eye and
started tearing up, that's all! Do you know the 25th rule
of Shinobi Conduct? The rule says a ninja must not
show tears! Hey... Stop it, you two... That's enough, both of you! Kakashi, rules and regulations
are indeed important. But that isn't everything.
Didn't I teach you...? There are times when
the situation requires impromptu responses against the enemy. There, you see?! Obito, you too! There's no way dust can get into
your eyes when you have goggles on. If you're going to advocate self-control,
don't just mouth the words. Act strong too. And one other thing... Kakashi... You shouldn't use
that jutsu anymore. From what I could see, your focal point concentrated attack
undoubtedly has power and speed... But it makes you move too fast to
ascertain the opponent's counterattack. It's still an imperfect jutsu. Before we part... I'll tell you one more thing. For a ninja, the most important thing
is teamwork. Sensei... What's the matter? I know...
that teamwork is important. But... Kakashi always criticizes me about
how I lack discipline, so... I mean... I know that I'm the black sheep
of the elite Uchiha Clan... And I admit that Kakashi is
an awesome guy... Kakashi is the son of the genius ninja,
Sakumo Hatake, feared as the "White Fang" of the Leaf. Even the legendary names of
the Leaf's Three Great Ninja paled before his father's. His childhood years were spent
under the shadow of such a genius... So I guess it can't be helped if,
at times, he finds you lacking. White Fang... That's right...
I've heard of him too. The hero who died protecting the village. Kakashi never said a word about that... He was a great man... Someone respected by everyone
in the village, and naturally, by Kakashi himself. That is, until that incident... Incident? Perhaps, I shouldn't be telling you
something like this... But since you're on the same team
as Kakashi, I want you to know. What happened...? Kakashi's father, Sakumo, took his own life
after being slandered. Five years ago, he was the leader
of an extremely difficult mission and infiltrated enemy territory. He was forced to make a choice. The mission or his comrades' lives... Of course, according to
the rules of the village, completing the mission was
the right thing to do. However, in order to save
his comrades, he suspended the mission. That resulted in grave losses to
the Land of Fire and the village, and he was blamed for it. What's more, the very comrades
he saved also criticized him. The whole ordeal took its toll
on Sakumo's health, physically and mentally. And finally, he took his life. From then on, Kakashi never uttered
a word about his father, and he strictly began to adhere
to every rule and regulation. Obito... Obito... Try to understand,
even if it's just a little. Kakashi means well. It's healing well. But don't over-exert yourself
or you'll open up the wound. Yeah. Let's start heading out. - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! We'll be splitting up from this point.
Good luck to you all. The enemy the other day was
doing surveillance alone. But from here on out,
we'll be fighting teams. Be careful... Let's get going... Captain. All right... Let's go! - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! Scatter! Hey... Mahiru went out for surveillance
and hasn't come back. You don't think those young brats
killed him, do you? Well then, let's ask them. Camouflage Jutsu... Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! We're taking this one. Wait! Damn it!! Obito! Don't go after them! What?! Do you realize what you just said?! Yeah... The two of us will continue this mission. And Rin? What about Rin?! Rin comes later. The enemy wants to find out
what we're up to. They won't kill her right away. And luckily, Rin is a Medical Ninja. So even if she ends up a prisoner of war,
she'll probably be treated cordially... On the condition that she treat
the wounded on their side. The problem is if the enemy learns
about our strategy. If they obtain that information,
no doubt, they'll immediately increase
the security on the bridge. That will make our mission
much more difficult. You're assuming Rin's safety
under baseless assumptions! What if those guys just now are lackeys
who don't give a damn?! Right now, saving Rin takes priority
over the mission! A ninja... must sacrifice a comrade in order
to carry out a mission. That is the rule. If we fail in this mission, it is possible that the war
will be prolonged and many more lives will
be sacrificed. That's just an assumption! And for something like that, you're willing to simply abandon
a comrade who's been through life and death
with you?! When you and I were wounded, Rin saved our lives with
her Medical Ninjutsu! If she hadn't been there,
we'd both be dead by now! That was Rin's duty. I don't like you, after all! I don't care. I'm the captain.
You will  obey me. Whatever the situation,
in order to keep the team together, one person gives the orders. That is why we have the rule
that states that members must obey
the team captain. Obito, you're not strong. That is why I was chosen
as captain of this team. Then why won't you try to save Rin?! As captain, you're strong. Strong enough to save
your comrades, right?! If you give in to your emotions
even for a moment and fail your mission,
you will regret it later. That is why our code of conduct
forbids any emotional feelings. You should know that. Rin... Rin was concerned about
your well-being. That's why she gave you that medkit. She even sewed on
a protective amulet inside it! The medkit and Medical Ninjutsu
are superb systems developed by the Hidden Leaf in order to increase
the success rate of our missions. But I told you yesterday, didn't I? "Getting something useless would
only get in the way." Something useless? To carry out his mission,
useful tools are essential to a ninja. Something like emotions are useless. Are you serious...?! Do you seriously believe that?! Yeah...I do... Forget it. You and I have been like water
and oil from the start. I'm going to rescue Rin! You don't understand anything...! Not about what happens if
you break the rules... I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero... Sure in the world of ninja, those who break the rules and
regulations are regarded as scum... But... those who abandon their comrades...
are worse than scum! I'm gonna be trash anyway,
so I choose to break the rules. And if that doesn't make me
a true ninja... Then I'll crush this so-called "ninja"!! When I think back,
I'm filled with regret.

 I was a cocky brat who had
just been promoted to jonin,

 and every other word I uttered
was about rules and regulations.

 But frankly, I knew nothing
about what was truly important.

 Until that day, when you
taught me a valuable lesson.

 Next time: Kakashi Chronicles
~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 2

 Tune in again!

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,670
Over there, huh... Any closer and I'll be noticed... Big Sister... Are you taking those
with you? Fate must have meant
for this to happen... Nothing will serve me better
than these if I'm gonna fight against him... I've lived too long a life... <i>The Retired Granny's Determination


</i> So...that's where his hideout is. Most likely. Gaara's scent was also coming
from that same place. I see. I have one more favor to ask you. Huh? Hey, are you awake, Naruto? Huh? Pakkun... Okay, Pakkun, I'm counting on you. See you around then, Naruto! Kakashi Sensei! Could it be that you've found
the Akatsuki's hideout? Yeah... We're heading out immediately. What, Gaara's whereabouts
have been--?! Yes ma'am! His whereabouts
have just been located. The Leaf are preparing
to depart immediately! Understood! Gather
our skilled men immediately! I will be heading out as well! Yes, ma'am! Temari... Kankuro, don't be so reckless! You need to stay in bed
and take it easy! I will get Gaara back,
no matter what! All right, as soon
as the Sand is ready, we'll join them for Gaara's rescue. Got it? Sorry to have kept you waiting! Temari! Everyone's here... All right! Then let's head out! Wait! Temari... You and the others stay here
in the village and patrol the border. What do you mean by that?! That's an order from...above. Huh...? Their reasoning is... if it becomes widely known that
the Kazekage is absent, there's no telling when other villages
will attack our village... I can't believe this... That's all the more reason that we have to get Gaara back
as soon as possible! These Leaf people came
all this way for the very purpose of
going to Gaara's aid! <i>Gaara is our  Kazekage, right?!</i> What's the point if we,
the Sand people, don't go to save him! But... I'm going. The only Sand Shinobi
you need is me! Granny Chiyo! But that's... I am already retired, you know... I can do whatever I like. You really shouldn't overdo it...! Don't you dare treat me
like an old woman! She jumped! Wha--?! I haven't doted on my dear grandchild
for a while, after all... All right, we'll head out. Sorry... I will try to convince
the higher-ups... We'll follow behind later,
no matter what! Gaara will be long rescued
by that time! See you later! Damn! If only I were
physically fit. There'd be no stopping me
from going...! Hey, we're going a little too fast! We haven't stopped running
since we left! Let's take a little break! Tenten, you need more training! Lee! In front of you! Wait, Guy! Pakkun! Naruto! Can I ask you something? Since when have you been
targeted by the Akatsuki? I don't know... There was that one time when
two people from the Akatsuki came to the Leaf Village in order to
make contact with Naruto. But that was three years ago... and they've just started
making a move now. I don't know why. Why did they wait three years? It could be that it's not because
they didn't want to, but because they couldn't. Because Lord Jiraiya was always
hanging close to Naruto... No... Based on information I acquired,
there apparently is another reason. Another...reason? There's quite a bit of
preparation involved if one's gonna draw out the Tailed Beast
that's sealed within people. They encountered difficulties
with that. What's this "Tailed Beast"
that you were talking about? What?! You're Tsunade's disciple
and you don't even know that?! The Leaf Village had
a Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit... The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit is treated as top secret
amongst the Leaf Village... Well, that's not surprising, I guess... A Tailed Beast refers to
Beast Spirits with tails. Long, long ago,
the Sand had a One-Tail. That's the Shukaku sealed
within Gaara. One-Tail? Do you mean that there are
other beasts besides the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit? That's right... There are a total of nine
tailed beasts in this world... Tailed beasts have
special characteristics. Each of them have
a different number of tails. The One-Tailed has one tail.
The Two-Tailed has two. And up to the Nine-Tailed
as the name suggests, each name represents
the number of tails the beast has. The Tailed beasts have
immense Chakra and in the world of Ninja, they were used for military purposes
by Hidden Villages around the world. They competed to get
their hands on them. But no one was able
to control that power which surpassed human intelligence. I don't know why
the Akatsuki is after it, but that power is too dangerous... But in this new peaceful age,
the Tailed beasts apparently... still exist, having scattered
all around the world... Kakashi directed us,
the Eight Ninja Hounds, to fan out in every direction to follow the Akatsuki
Organization's scent. While we were doing that,
we realized that those guys were headed towards
the Land of Rivers which is situated between
the Leaf and Sand. The Land of Rivers...? That's right. In other words, you guys are closest to the Akatsuki
at this point in time. You, who were heading from
the Leaf to the Sand Village. I see... Follow me...
I'll explain the details as we run. All right! Let's go, everybody! Huh? Already? <i>An enemy is nearing
this hideout.</i> An enemy, you said? <i>And a highly skilled one at that.</i> <i>His name is...Might Guy.</i> <i>Who's that?</i> <i>A Leaf Jonin Ninja who
uses Taijutsu.</i> <i>He's one clever operator.
Don't underestimate him.</i> <i>Ah...that freak beast, huh...</i> <i>We will use that Jutsu...</i> <i>In that case, I'll go...</i> <i>I was getting irritated for not
having any luck finding a Jinchuriki.</i> <i>No, I'll go...</i> <i>I have something of a personal quarrel
with him, you see...</i> <i>You're right. That Jutsu is more suited
to someone like you.</i> <i>Among the Akatsuki,</i> <i>you are more heavily loaded
with Chakra, Kisame.</i> <i>Yes...</i> <i>Even so, I'll take 30%
of your Chakra.</i> <i>Well, well, well...</i> <i>It looks like I'll finally be
able to get pay back</i> for that kick he gave me... <i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i> <i>Who the heck is he?</i> <i>The Noble Blue Beast of
the Leaf Village... Mighty Guy.</i> What's up?! Someone's coming! Byakugan! Behind us! You... Do you know him, Guy Sensei?! Who are you? <i>Another guest...</i> <i>It's a little noisy this time,
isn't it, Deidara!</i> Well, the Jinchuriki was
stronger than the other two... I told you at the start, didn't I? Your Jutsu wasn't suited
for covert operations. I'd say your traps were
pretty loud too, weren't they? What! <i>Stop fighting amongst yourselves!</i> <i>Concentrate on the Jutsu!</i> <i>Now then...
who should I send this time...</i> <i>This time it's my turn,
without any doubt.</i> <i>Another Leaf Shinobi...</i> <i>Damn!</i> <i>In that case, it's decided...</i> Everybody, halt! Who is that? Out of the blue, huh... That guy...those eyes... You're... This guy...has a ridiculous amount
of Chakra. I've never seen anyone besides
Naruto with that amount of Chakra. That much...? Are you really saying
you don't remember...? Don't tell me you're...! It appears that you've remembered... Have we met before? It looks like
the freak beast's intelligence is at the level of a beast too... Well...I'll make you
remember soon... Itachi...Uchiha! <i>Th-That guy is...</i> <i>That guy is...Itachi...Uchiha!</i> Guy Sensei, what is that?! Lee, that is what we've been
waiting for! Then that is what all
the surfers long for, the legendary big wave that
arrives only once every few years...?! Big Thursday! Go, Lee! Now is your chance to conquer
that big wave and become a man! Yes, sir! Please watch Guy Sensei,
I'll prove to you my fighting spirit! Will you two stop talking
like that already?! Next time: "A Meeting With Destiny" ~Thanks for watching on Crunchyroll.com~ You finally came. What is the situation? I'd say there are about fifty
of the enemy. Compared to that,
there are just four of us left alive. It'll all be over soon.
We will all attack at once. Everyone, please direct these kunai knives
towards the enemy all at once. I will do the rest... That's crazy! Not even you could... Shut up and do as he says. We're about to see
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf in battle. It'll happen in a flash. Don't miss it. It's healing well... But don't over-exert yourself
or you'll open up the wound. When you and I were wounded, Rin saved our lives with
her Medical Ninjutsu! If she hadn't been there,
we'd both be dead by now! Right now, saving Rin takes priority
over the mission! Kakashi, rules and regulations
are indeed important. But that isn't everything.
Didn't I teach you...? There are times
when the situation requires impromptu responses
against the enemy. I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero... Sure in the world of ninja, those who break the rules and regulations
are regarded as scum... But... those who abandon their comrades
are worse than scum! Kakashi Chronicles
~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 2

 I found them... Calm down... I can do this! I'll take care of it. In the meantime, use your genjutsu
and get the information from her. Camouflage Jutsu... All right... Here I go! Go where? K-Kakashi... How come you're...?! Well, I can't leave this up to
a crybaby ninja like you, can I? Kakashi... That silver-white hair and
White Chakra Blade...! Don't tell me you're...
the "White Fang" of the Leaf?! This is my father's keepsake. To carry out his mission,
useful tools are essential to a ninja. Something like emotions are useless. Kakashi...you... I see... You're the White Fang's kid... Then there's no need to
be afraid of you. I thought so. The scent has been completely erased. We'll have to locate him by the slightest movement
and noise he makes. Wh-Where is he? Obito, behind you! My eye...! Kakashi! Hey Kakashi! Are you all right?! Even if he's just a kid,
it doesn't hurt to be cautious... I'll take it nice and slow. Our enemy... He's good... He threw away the kunai knife stained
with the smell of my blood. Don't tell me you got dust
in your eye again? A ninja shouldn't cry... I'm not dead yet. Stay focused! There's no way dust can
get into your eyes when you have goggles on. If you're going to advocate self-control,
don't just mouth the words. Act strong too. I'm just talk...
Always being saved by others... Just a big-mouthed loser... But... I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero... Those who abandon their comrades...
are worse than scum! I don't want those words
to be just empty talk! Die! Wh-Why...? There's no way you can see... Obito... You...! Wh-What is... that eye...? This time... I'll protect my comrade! Obito... That eye of yours... Yeah... I guess this is the Sharingan. I can now see the movement
and flow of chakra. Are you all right, Kakashi?! Yeah... Looks like I lost my left eye, but I have the kit Rin gave me. I can use it for emergency first-aid. We're going to save Rin immediately! Okay! You're surprisingly stubborn. Hmm.... They're all so pathetic. The flow of Rin's chakra is disturbed... It's different from your chakra
or mine. She's probably under a genjutsu... They didn't waste any time trying
to get the information out of her. It seems they're not mere kids. We fought him earlier.
He's fast... Stay alert! Right! Release! Kakashi... Obito...! We've come to save you, Rin! You'll be all right now. All right, now let's get out of here! I see... You two made a good team,
but you're still just kids. Right now, you're in enemy hands. Earth Style: Rock Breaker! This is bad!! Run for the exit! Kakashi! Too bad, I lost a good source
of information... Oh well, it can't be helped. Are you all right?
Rin...? Kakashi...? Obito! Don't... It's okay, Kakashi. I don't think...I can make it... My right side is totally crushed. I can't even feel anything... Dammit!! No... This can't be... Why...? Obito...! Dammit! Dammit!! If...If only I had listened to you, and we had come to rescue Rin
in the first place... This never would've happened! So what if I'm a captain?!
So what if I made jonin?! Oh yeah... I had forgotten... I was the only one who... didn't give you a gift... for becoming a jonin, Kakashi. I was...wondering what to give you... and I just had a thought. Don't worry... It's not some useless, extra baggage... I'm giving you...my Sharingan. Whatever the village may say... you are...a great jonin. That's how I really feel... So please accept it. Rin... Use your Medical Ninjutsu... Take the entire eye and transplant...
my Sharingan... into Kakashi's left eye. Kakashi, come over here...
I'll start it right away. I'm about to...die... But...I'll become your eye and... see the future...for you. How stubborn...
You're still alive, huh? But...you're just a kid, after all. What's a ninja crying for? Come on, crybaby! Let's settle this. That kid...
He seems different than before... Kakashi...take care of...Rin. Yeah... Don't panic...Rin. Kakashi... Take Rin... Take Rin and...get out...of here. Enemy reinforcements...
will be coming. Obito... It's okay... Just go... Rin! Earth Style! Earthquake Slam! Rin, hurry, take my hand! Rin! Obito!! Just when Kakashi and I were...
starting to get along... I couldn't tell Rin that I...
loved her... I wish...I could've spent more time...
with everyone. Obito! Damn it...! Obito... This is the jutsu
you helped me perfect! Hmm... You still have the will to fight,
even in this situation? No wonder you were able to sneak
so deep into enemy territory. You are a determined one. Rin! I'll hold them off!
Get out now! But...! I promised Obito I'd look after you... I'll protect you with my life! Kakashi... Rin... Obito cared about you. He loved you... You were everything to him. That's why he gave his life
to protect you. Then, Kakashi! You should know
my feelings for you... I...! I tried to abandon you... I'm nothing but scum. Rin, go! Am I...dead? Where am I? Looks like
you've regained consciousness. Huh?! Sensei! But how...? The jutsu formula on this kunai knife
serves as a marker when I leap using
the Transportation Technique. Then...the enemy? I took them all down... Rin... Where is Rin?! I'm sorry
I couldn't make it in time, Kakashi... Rin told me everything. The Third Great Ninja War. With the sacrifice of
many nameless ninja, this long war finally came to a close. In its wake, it also left legends... The stories of great heroes, to be told and retold
for generations to come. The Battle of Kannabi Bridge... That day, two heroes were born
in the Hidden Leaf Village, each with his own Sharingan. One found his name engraved
on the memorial stone. The other came to be known
as "Kakashi of the Sharingan." In time, the tales of his bravery spanned
all borders, and beyond. Capture Itachi Uchiha...

 It won't be an easy mission.

 But it's something I can't avoid.

 To bring back Sasuke, eh?

 I'm sure you're aware of this,

 but Sasuke is now powerful enough
to even kill Orochimaru.

 I know that.
But I never go back on my word.

 That's my Ninja Way.

 Next time: "Assemble"

 Tune in again!

 You've finally settled down. Sheesh, what a handful. You're back. Yeah, but having to bring him back
without killing him, was quite a bother. It's starting to rain. Looks like it'll storm. Let's take cover under a tree, or we'll catch a cold. Leader is waiting for word that
we've captured him. Immediately thereafter, the sealing of the Three-Tails
and Four-Tails is to occur simultaneously. So we make him wait a little. Once the sealing begins,
we'll be working for quite some time. He seems near death. You must handle the elderly
with care. You say that because
you don't know him. This Jinchuriki who uses the
Corrosion Style Jutsu of the Four-Tails isn't what you think. You didn't fight him yourself, so you wouldn't understand
what I went through. But, I was the one who asked
to go alone. Say, want me to beat
your assignment half-dead too? Don't get so excited, Kisame. Well, I'm a bit tired, you see. I wish we could catch all
the Tailed Beasts already. Don't be so impatient...
It's going to take some time. I wonder about that.
There's just a few more, right? And it's been decided that
the Nine-Tails will be sealed last... Otherwise, the balance
will be disrupted, and the sealing statue
will be pulverized... That's what Leader said... After all, the Jinchuriki need
to be captured alive. So I say just catch them quickly
and leave them tied up. Humph... Fine with me,
but remember that Deidara failed. If he's going to be sealed last, it's no big deal if
we capture him last. And besides, Akatsuki is becoming
too conspicuous lately. If we capture the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
too soon, the Hidden Leaf will become
even more of a nuisance. Heh... You really think so? The Hidden Leaf Village has
very strong links with other villages. If they begin to collaborate,
it will be difficult for us to act. It will be wiser to collect up
to the Eight-Tails with as little commotion as possible. I see. I guess you're right. There's the summons. We've been caught dawdling. You're late... We had just finished catching
the Jinchuruki when you contacted us. We tied him up good to
make sure he didn't escape. That's what took us longer. So, what's up? I got an urgent message
I wanted to relay to you. Orochimaru has been killed. It's been ten years since
he deserted us... So we've been spared the trouble
of killing him ourselves. I would've loved to see him die as much as I would've loved to
see the Zombie Combo die. Hidan and Kakuzu were
our comrades. Don't say such things. Sorry... Back then,
they were done in by... The Hidden Leaf. The squad with Kakashi and
the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki. They're strong, that team.
Even Deidara got his butt kicked. Tobi!! Say one more word and my patience
will run out! It will! It takes self-control to be patient... And your fuse is too short for that. Why you--! Tobi! You! Pipe down, Deidara. Tobi's right. You got chewed out! But Tobi, you always talk too much.
Respect your superiors. Okay! Sorry! And we're supposed to get
the remaining Jinchuriki with these two? But killing Orochimaru took
special skill. Who did it? Sasuke Uchiha. I was gonna be the one to
bring Orochimaru down. Hmm... He's good. I'd expect nothing less from
your kid brother, Itachi. He's gathering members... Really troublesome ninja at that. What do you mean? You know them well too... One of the Hozuki Brothers
of the Hidden Mist... You mean, Suigetsu?
That brings back memories. And also, Bipolar Jugo. So be on your guard,
Itachi and Kisame... I dare say they're targeting you two. And the rest of you should keep
Sasuke Uchiha in mind. After getting information
about Itachi and Kisame, they may just come after Akatsuki. Kisame, what kind of guy is he...? This Suigetsu...hmm? It happened ten years ago... He had such a cute smile. A child prodigy who's been called the reincarnation of
the demonic Zabuza. Are you a river child
who got stranded on land?! Quit stopping to drink water so often! Hmm... They seem like an interesting lot. Hey, don't get too interested.
And just leave me out of it! Never mind that already.
Itachi, Kisame... hurry up and
get the Four-Tails. We'll seal him at the same time
as the Three-Tails! Understood. Cripes, and I thought
we'd get to rest a bit. We have no choice. Let's hurry. Assemble

 We target the member of Akatsuki with whom we have
the highest chance of meeting Sasuke. Well, I can see the logic in that. Itachi Uchiha... What shall we do? If we're able to take just one of
the Akatsuki into custody, Ibiki can get information about
Itachi out of him. I've already issued an order to
all teams to capture a member of Akatsuki
if the opportunity presents itself, and to transport him here. That will probably be very difficult. Kakashi Sensei... We won't be able to make them
talk so easily. Even those we've already encountered
were far too dangerous and we couldn't even think about
taking them into custody. Then what're we gonna do?! Well, until we come across Itachi, I don't think we have any choice
but to be very patient and search. I can't go on.
Let's take a short break... As long as you drag your feet like that,
we'll never get there! Well, pardon me. But unlike you,
I have a very delicate constitution. Huh? Look, just evaporate,
you water ghost! Why don't you get lost instead? I thought you had somewhere else to go? We're here. This is a big one. So you've come... All right, we'll begin the sealing
starting with the Three-Tails. All right! Assemble. Let's begin. We're here. What a creepy-looking place. Let's go. A hideout in an old ruin like this... It's news to me. Orochimaru has nothing to do with this. My clan used this as a weapons store. We'll prepare for the battle
that will be fought here. The passageways look so similar,
it's easy to get lost in here. But what a depressing place.
It stifles my breath. Sorry if it's depressing here. Huh? It's been a long time,
Denka and Hina. It's young Sasuke, after all... What's your business here? What's your business here? Weapons and medicine...
and various other things. We're preparing for battle. This is... Oh, a talking raccoon dog? Hey, come over here. Yikes... They're ninja cats.
Don't approach them carelessly. They'll tear you apart. You should warn us about stuff
like that from the beginning. Did you bring us a present? Here...a bottle of catnip. Thank you. Follow me. I'll take you to Granny Cat. I owe you, Granny Cat. It's been so long since we've met,
but you're in such a hurry. Yeah. I have something important to do. You're not a ninja cat, right?
There, there. No, stop. Even this one is too small. Sorry. So you're going to see Itachi,
after all? I've known you both since
you were little, but little did I imagine
it would come to this... You two are all that's left
of the Uchiha Clan... And now, you'll have to
fight to the death. I'm going. Thanks for everything. Granny, don't we have something bigger
for him to wear? In that box over there! Nothing fits. Then just wrap that curtain
around him! I don't run a clothing store! Granny! What a rude thing to say,
considering he paid us! Fine. Pursue Itachi in order to meet up
with Sasuke, eh? Well then...
Say we find Itachi. What next? About that... I have an idea.
Can you spare some time? You don't look too pleased. Pervy Sage?
What're you doing here? I hadn't seen my apprentice in a while, so I thought maybe
we could share a meal. Are you treating? ICHIRAKU RAMEN Cripes, what's with Kakashi Sensei? Here, we're ready to move out
any time. It can't be helped.
There are lots of things to prepare for. Prepare for what? One small squad isn't enough. What do you mean by that? Listen. If Itachi is defeated, Sasuke will lose his purpose
in coming. So we have no choice
but to find a way to detain Itachi. And that will require a coordinated effort
with more ninja. Right now, Kakashi has his hands full
trying to get this organized. Is that how it is? But we're dealing with Itachi here.
Ordinary methods won't work. Probably not... And we can't just avoid him, can we? And just bring Sasuke back? I'm sure you understand, but Sasuke has grown powerful enough
to kill Orochimaru. I know that... But I made a promise
to Sakura long ago... That I'd "bring Sasuke back without fail." And I can't go back on my word. What is most important to a ninja is not the number of jutsu
he possesses... What's important is... - To never give up!
- To never give up! Determination! That's my Ninja Way! You're as foolish as ever. I can't help it. After all, I'm the apprentice
of the Pervy Sage. Geez, what a rude apprentice
I'm stuck with. "Rude"?! What does that mean? Exactly that, you rude apprentice. You're one to talk, Pervy Sage! You're a no-good, perverted old man! Here, eat this too. Oh... Ichiraku's roast pork is still the best. Cripes, sealing the Tailed Beast
is such a pain! And there's more to go after this, right? Just thinking about it frazzles me. Now then... which way? Hmm... Umm... Excuse me, Senpai,
"which way" what? What do you mean? What do you think?! Do we go for the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki
whose team is led by Kakashi... or Sasuke Uchiha...? Hey, we shouldn't mess with either one! Our assignment is over! And furthermore,
Sasuke's not even a Tailed Beast! Are you kidding...?! The Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki owes me one
for punching me. And Kakashi got my right arm... Then there's Sasuke Uchiha... I can't forgive him 'cuz he killed
Orochimaru, whom I planned to kill. Geez... Once he sets his mind to something,
he just won't listen. Did you say something? No. Humph. We're going, Tobi. Oh dear... That Deidara has gotten
all worked up about going after your little brother. Is that okay with you, Itachi? Let's go! I see. You've given it
quite a bit of thought. Say, shouldn't we have even more guys? It's not simply a matter of manpower. For this job, I think two squads
working together are ideal. If our targets are few in number,
namely one or two, having more than three squads
will make us too easy to detect as well as interfere with
the chain of command. And it will end up hindering our mobility. Restraining the enemy requires
much more technique than mere killing. In coordinating the squads,
it would be wise to choose members who are accustomed to working together. Well, right now,
this is the best plan. Thank you. Well, we're about ready to set out,
but I don't like this weather. All right! Let's go! The rain is perfect for cooling off someone
so fired up. Okay, I'm issuing the order
for a mission to locate and detain Itachi Uchiha! All of you, be extremely careful
and carry out your duties! - Right!
- Right! Basically, this search team is organized by one ninja and two ninja hounds. However, Yamato and Hinata
the Visual Jutsu User will accompany Naruto just in case he,
a Jinchuriki, is attacked. I'm counting on you, Hinata. Yes. Listen, we're after Itachi and Sasuke. But, even if you find either of them,
come back to this point. Now, go! Next time: "The Hunt"

 - Good night!
- Good night! That was a tough recording session. Sakura, how about stopping for
some ramen on the way home--? No thanks. That was a quick answer. N-Naruto... What's wrong, Hinata? I-If it's okay, I... I...? - I-I mean...
- "I mean" what?! Come to think of it, lately Hinata's only line
has been "Naruto." That's true! Starting from the next episode, maybe we can keep using
the same line over and over again. What?! That's what the director said. Even though it's the same line, I'm saying it from
the bottom of my heart. So when you're embarrassed? N-Naruto... When you're happy! Naruto... When you're angry! N-Naruto! - Cry!
- N-Naruto... - Rush!
- Naruto! - Smile!
- Naruto... Scream! Naruto! That's okay.
We'll be using these lines for a while. Huh?! STUDIO


N-No way. Tune in again!

 All right. Starting now, our main mission
is to find Itachi and take him into custody. - Yeah!
- Yes! Akatsuki's goal is to round up
the Tailed Beasts. It is believed that they already
have the Three-Tails. According to the data
obtained by Jiraiya, it's possible they have infiltrated
the Land of Fire and will target Naruto. Itachi, in particular, is originally
from the Leaf Village. Three years ago, he returned to
the village and attempted to take Naruto. So he's headed for
the Leaf Village again? As well as Sasuke
who is after this Itachi Uchiha! Alright! I'm gonna meet up
with Sasuke no matter what. Well, let's just take it
one step at a time. Here's the search plan. Using this as the central point, we'll search all four directions
for five kilometers. If we find nothing, then we'll move the central point and
spread out five kilometers from there. And...we'll keep repeating this strategy. Five kilometers...
Our wireless radio will be out of range! And if we're separated,
it'll be dangerous! The rules state that all patrols must
be done by two-man cells. - If we encounter the enemy--!
- Sakura... Don't get so worried. Just watch... Our voices which travel even farther
than the wireless radios, and our noses that can instantly
sniff out danger, will protect you. Pakkun! All right, let me explain
the patrol team formation. This time, two ninja hounds will
be assigned to each member. Two dogs...? Huh? But... Get along, all of you. Hello, Sakura. You're such a snappy female
as usual. I'm partnering with Shino. Ugh... You stink of insects. You stink like a dog. Hello. Let's work together... In peace and harmony...
Hehehe! I wonder if...
I can become friends with dogs? What about me? Naruto, you're the Jinchuriki
they're targeting. Just in case you're attacked, you'll be with Yamato and
Sensory-Scout Hinata. And Big Bark Bull. L-Let's work together, Naruto. Right! And being ninja-hound users,
Kiba and I will each have one dog. So we're all set! Listen up, everyone. Above all, you will track
Itachi and Sasuke's scents. If you find either one of them, verify their location,
then return to this spot. Especially you, Naruto.
Don't go running off ahead of us. I know. All right then, let's head out. Scatter! The Hunt

 I'm going. Itachi Uchiha, eh?
I hope we can find him. All right! Sa-su-ke! I'm staying with you! You too. Get going. Drat! It's completely healed... Yeah. And? Which one are we going for? Sasuke or the Nine-Tails...? Well now, which will it be...? W-W-Wait, D-Deidara Senpai! Wait up! PAWN SHOP Who are you?! I guess underlings don't matter. Go and check. Yes. Huh? Who are you?! You're that Akatsuki...
What's his name? Kaku... Kakuta... Kakusa... Kakushi... K-Kakuzu... Yes, that's the one. You're that Kakuzu's henchman-
his bookkeeper, right? I'll tell you anything
you want to know. J-Just please don't kill me... That's the way... Keep talking. Let me ask you guys... Akamaru! Don't lose to
the other ninja hounds! We'll be the first to detect Sasuke
and Itachi's scents! You're too slow, Shino! Don't dawdle! I don't like them... Let's go! Pochi! Tama! Pochi...? Tama?! Don't give me silly nicknames! Sasuke... If you don't wipe that solemn look
off your face, you'll scare off the boys. What? The more you chase,
the further they run away. You're a female that keeps
on pushing, aren't you? Why don't you try pulling away
for a change? What a thing to say! Sasuke and I... aren't like that... Hey, stop being so rude. Humph! It's just that I want to
let Sasuke know... how I...how everyone feels. Everyone is waiting for Sasuke
to return home. That's all... Fine. Well, if pulling away doesn't work,
why don't I try sniffing? What's the matter?! I caught a whiff of
Sasuke Uchiha's scent... What?! Well? The smell is faint,
but it's steadily getting closer. What are you doing?!
He'll be on to us before we find him! We have to be cautious! He's near. Sakura, do you see Sasuke around? This isn't good.
The smell is going farther away. I've given it a once-over,
but I don't sense any chakra. Maybe I'll go back to Sasuke. The other two are probably
not back yet. I found it, Tobi! Yeah! No kidding?! That was fast! And? Which one is it?
The Nine-Tails or Sasuke? What an opportunity.
We're going together, Tobi. So... Which one? Just follow me! Yes. Naruto... Hinata...
You understand, right? Yes. Yeah... You're...! Show yourself...
Who are you? You found me, after all... Kabuto Yakushi... You've got guts approaching us
by yourself. I wanted to have a chat
with Naruto. You're not getting away this time.
We're taking you in. Hey! Kabuto! You would know!
Where is Sasuke?! Humph! Still can't get over Sasuke, eh...? Is it true that Sasuke
killed Orochimaru?! Yeah... It's true. More importantly,
I brought you a present today. That outfit... You're... So you're Sasuke...
You really do look like Itachi! S-Scary! - Ha!
- Ha! What's that? Information our organization
has gathered regarding Akatsuki. What of it? It's yours. You can have it. Now that Orochimaru is dead... you're trying to negotiate with us? Nope... I don't think it's as easy
as negotiating with something like this... Especially with the Leaf Village. Then why? Unlike Orochimaru,
Akatsuki isn't after you. It's a simple gift to Naruto.
A token of my gratitude. Plus, Akatsuki is pursuing you. Gratitude...? After Lord Orochimaru died, I lost sense of who I was. I never knew my parents
or my homeland. The enemy found me and
from the time I was little, I moved around the lands
and villages as a spy. Lands and villages didn't
mean much to me. That is, until I began serving
Lord Orochimaru... But now, he's gone too. Just who am I?
The agony of not having an identity... You can understand,
can't you, Naruto? Like I'd understand
anything you say! Humph... I wonder about that. Are you Naruto Uzumaki?
Or are you the Nine-Tails? In the past, you were shunned...
regarded with loathing. You must have questioned yourself
about who you really are. However, you had faith
in your strength and told yourself that
you were Naruto Uzumaki... and you boldly overcame
their views about the Nine-Tails. What does he intend...
to do with Naruto? I can't figure out his intentions... And that's why you are sure
of your identity and you found friends
who accept you. But instead of overcoming
Lord Orochimaru, I desperately clung to his power. I'm really able to understand
how you feel now. You made me realize...
that I want to be like you. So now... I'm going to surpass Lord Orochimaru
whom I absorbed, and discover a new, stronger self. I'll find my new self... and you have given me
a hint to finding it. That's why I'm grateful...Naruto. Lord Orochimaru is
the symbol of reincarnation. He continues to live on inside me,
as an existence that I must overcome. Took...into your body? Well... It was just a small segment
of Lord Orochimaru's corpse after Sasuke killed him... which I transplanted into my own body. But, his life-force is amazing. It's now steadily trying to
take over my body...this thing. That's ridiculous... What is that? Byakugan! One-third of his body has
already been taken over. But I've been fiercely resisting
this takeover! I can feel this part of me that's trying
to overcome Lord Orochimaru! Is that all you want to say? Well, give it everything you've got! In a jail cell in Leaf Village! Wood Style! All right! Gotcha! Behind you! Dammit... When I'm able to fully control
Lord Orochimaru's power, I will fight you again, Naruto. But you come later. First, it'll be Sasuke who
brought down Lord Orochimaru. What're you gonna do to Sasuke?! Until we meet again. We did it!
We brought down Sasuke. As expected, Senpai... As expected, Senpai. Shut up! But looks like he's kinda strong...
this guy. Imagine Orochimaru being killed
by a brat like him. I still can't believe it... Huh? Tobi, look how
he's glaring at us! Humph! You're raring to go, eh Senpai? You'll have to apologize to Itachi later. You guys must be Akatsuki.
Where's Itachi Uchiha?

 Huh?

 If you tell me nicely,
I'll let you go.

 What shall we do, Senpai?
He's playing hardball.

 Sharingan...eh?
You're Itachi's kid brother, all right.

 So you were able to kill Orochimaru
because of your Uchiha bloodline...

 Lucky enough to be born into that family!
That's all it was!

 If you don't feel like telling me,
that's fine.

 I'll just wring the information
from you by force.

 Next time: "Clash!"

 PAWN SHOP Oh... Once again, the due date for
Lady Tsunade's debt is looming. Tonton! We have no choice. Let's go and do that thing
like we used to! Huh? You'll catch a cold sleeping out here. Oww... Are you all right, Bro...? Um... I'd like to borrow some money. Bro! This one's a winner! I know! I know! If we sell her,
I think we'll get over a million ryo! All right! How's about 500,000 ryo? Thank you very much! I'm sorry! PAWN SHOP


Bro, the pig disappeared! What?! What a day
this is turning out to be! Tune in again!

 Sasuke Uchiha... I can't forgive him
'cuz he killed Orochimaru, whom I planned to kill! Ha! Tobi, look how he's glaring at us! Clash!

 Where's Itachi Uchiha? Huh? Tell me, and I'll let you go. Sharingan...eh? He really is Itachi's little brother. You were only able to kill Orochimaru
thanks to your Uchiha blood. You're nothing but a fool
blessed with good genes! He's fast! Huh?! One down. So I'll ask you,
the one with the big mouth, about Itachi. What're you doing, Tobi?! Don't let your guard down
just because he's a kid! His Teleportation Jutsu is too quick.
We're no match for him! That guy...! First, I'll watch his movements
with chakra level C1. Tobi! Stay back! S-Senpai! Time out! Don't do it! Senpai! Behind you, behind you! Ha! Senpai! He was strict, but a good partner... I shall never forget about you,
Deidara Senpai--! Will you shut up?! Oh, you're alive? The ability to produce
an explosive with his palm, huh? I somehow managed to escape
by hiding in the bomb blast... Good thing I kept
the chakra level at C1. He definitely moves swiftly... How about this then? I'll play with you a bit more! Child's play? So stupid. It's not over yet! I guess...it's about time. No way! Huh? Yeah, I thought so. Hey...! How's that?! Oh... He's not much, after all... I knew it! Hey, Tobi! Whose side are you on anyway?! A Substitution Jutsu, eh? Well, he's definitely quite skilled... Then this calls for C2. Th-That's...! Ta-daa! One of Senpai's signature
art pieces, the C2 Dragon! Tobi, you know what to do, right?! Of course, Senpai!
We're going with "that," right?! Yeah! "That" is the plan... That huge thing becomes
an explosive too? I'm counting on you, Tobi! Right! And judging from its looks,
it'll be attacking from the sky...! This is bad. Here he comes!
Let's show him, Senpai... The power of your pop art! Pop art is dead! My art is... Superflat! Ha! It's different from before...
A guided missile? Where's the other one? Guess I'll start off with him! Looks like it can only reach up
to five meters, eh? Tsk... He figured out my limit. That's Kakashi's trick right?! I'll give you credit for the skill in
changing chakra form to extend and throw. But the force of this one's different
from earlier. Blow to bits! He really is swift. Got him! Did I get him...? That's...Orochimaru's Curse Mark! He can even grow wings? He managed to dodge it
by flying upwards... Senpai! All the land mine clay is set
and ready to go! Good job, Tobi! You stay back. Yessir! Guided missile attacks from above,
and land mines from the ground! The key element of
the C2 coordinated assault is using the land mines
to slow you down and finishing you off with
a pinpoint missile attack. Land mines are planted all around you! Step on one and you'll set them off! He plans to ram the guided missile
right into me. And it's flying just outside
my attack perimeter... With that wounded leg, I wonder if you can dodge
my aerial attack...hmm? The next one's gonna be big! As if I'll let you fly away! Ha! That's what you get for trying to
guard yourself with wings. You can't fly anymore, can you?
Not with one wing... You're awesome, Deidara Senpai! Well, let's settle this! As if that'll hit me! No foothold! Fall on a land mine
and you'll lose a limb for sure! A-A foothold?! What?! He reached me? Deidara's balance...! He purposely stuck his sword
in the ground? He tested for the presence of land mines
and created a foothold?! The length of the sword,
which he used as a foothold... And that jump using his single wing... This position?! I see. With that attack,
he lured me directly above the sword... The shortest distance that
a chakra sword would reach... Senpai! I can't move...! This is bad!
Below me are the land mines...! Senpai!! You did die by bombing, after all! Deidara Senpai...you fool! I keep telling you to shut up, Tobi! Huh? Y-You're still alive...? What a stubborn... You...stupid brat! Those eyes... It's those same eyes... Damn it! "Akatsuki"? Like I care! Don't interfere with
my appreciation of art. And I'm supposed to take
this kid as my partner...? He's feisty, but looks like
the type to die young. It's our leader's orders...
We can use his powers. You know about my power?
Just who the hell are...? You're the bomb terrorist
who's been supporting the anti-government factions
in various lands. What purpose would that serve
a rogue ninja like you...? Purpose? I have no purpose! I get requests to set off explosions,
so I do. With my creations! Creations? That's right. Look! Well? Such refined lines, and a form that pursues
two-dimensional deform. This  is art! But that's not all there is to my art! My creations flow! When it has shape,
it's simply molded clay! But this explodes! And the explosion causes sublimation, and for the first time,
the essence of my creation appears! That instant of sublimation is
when I experience true art! Art is an explosion! How annoying... Is he done? Who knows... Never mind... I'll do it. What's with his eyes...? You wanna fight? If I win,
you will become a member of Akatsuki. Don't belittle...me...or my art! My ninjutsu is nothing
but noble, refined art! Feel my art! Ha! You talked big...
but is that all you have? It's over! You should take a good look
at yourself. Huh? Wh-What?! That was close. A little later and
you would've blown yourself up. I told you he was the type to die young. A Genjutsu! When?! From the very beginning. From the moment you looked
into Itachi's Sharingan eye, you were under his Genjutsu. Beautiful... This is...art! Damn! I became fascinated
by the abilities of another? That's art? No way... I refuse to acknowledge it! You lose. Don't mess with me!
I'm better than you! My ability is flawless...
It's art that is unbeatable! I'm better than you! I can't lose...! Lose to such a... Lose to such a...! Huh?! He's eating the Detonation Clay,
which means... I saved the best for last!
I'll kill you with this! Tobi, get away! Whoa, yikes! It's the C4 Karura! Hurry!! This was supposed to be
my trump card to kill Itachi, but... What?! Wow, the enemy is pretty strong.
He's not Itachi's little brother for nothing.

 But boy, Senpai sure is fired up.
Flying, exploding and falling.

 At this rate, he'll really have
to apologize to Itachi later.

 Wow? W-Wait a minute, Senpai!

 Could that possibly be the...?

 Ayeee...! No no no!

 Please don't say "Ha!" just yet!

 Next time: "Art"

 Tune in again!

 He's eating the Detonation Clay,
which means... I saved the best for last!
I'll kill you with this! Tobi, get away! Whoa, yikes! It's the C4 Karura! Hurry...! This was supposed to be
my trump card to kill Itachi, but... Is this a bomb too? If so... It's huge! If this goes off... What, you're just gonna run away?! You really think you can escape
from my C4 Karura?! It misfired...? No... That's not it. What?! I win! Art is an explosion! Sublimate! Damn! This can't...be happening! Art  

 Now this is my greatest masterpiece! There we go! The C4 Karura...
Super tiny, nano-sized explosives. Using the blast created from
rupturing the giant Deidara, explosives too small
for the human eye to see are dispersed into the atmosphere. Any living being that inhales them will set off explosions internally
in all parts of the body. And these little explosions
will destroy the body on the cellular level... A frightening jutsu... I have to thank Itachi... I've won! I've won! My art wo-! It seems you've exhausted your chakra... Your reaction was slow. Those eyes... Explosives too small for
the eye to see... But my Sharingan can distinguish
a chakra by its color. The mini-bombs molded with
your chakra... They were as clear to me as
a cloud of smoke. I could also tell that you were hovering just outside the mini-bombs'
blast range. So as long as I could see the explosives,
escape was easy. But I saw you die from my C4... That was my genjutsu. So that was it, after all... I avoided your vital spot. Now tell me where Itachi is. That's why I said...
"I have to thank Itachi." A clay...clone?! I anticipated your genjutsu.
You're just like Itachi! I never fall for the same trick twice! Yes... Ever since
the day I fought Itachi... Don't belittle...me...or my art! My ninjutsu is nothing
but noble, refined art! Feel my art! You talked big...
but is that all you have? It's over...! You should take a good look
at yourself. Huh? Wh-What?! That was close. A little later and
you would've blown yourself up. I told you he was the type to die young. A genjutsu! When?! From the very beginning. From the moment you looked into
Itachi's Sharingan eye, you were under his Genjutsu. Beautiful... This is...art! Damn! I became fascinated by
 the abilities of another? That's art? No way... I refuse to acknowledge it! I trained my left eye to
counter the Sharingan. As if I'd neglect training
to counter genjutsu! This time, it's over for real!
Eat my C4! It seems you're the one lacking chakra! You don't even have
the strength left to dodge! Huh?! Just as I thought... Inside are the same invisible
C4 explosives. Tsk! My wound hurts... On top of that, I used up my chakra
with that last attack. What a poor piece of work...! Now what'll you do?! Hmm? He used what's left of
his Lightning Blade... Your Lightning Blades won't reach me
at this distance! It's over. Ha! I won. I'm the winner! My art triumphed! Why?! Wh-What's going on? This is no genjutsu...
But then... How... How did he disarm my C4? You... Don't tell me you figured it out? Yeah... Quite a while back... When facing the Sharingan,
it's basic to hide and form your seal. No matter how fast you are,
these eyes will read them. Every jutsu you've used has been
with Earth Style seals. My Chidori is the Lighting Style...
Get it now? So you knew, after all... Then that Lightning Blade
you used was to... The Earth Style is vulnerable
to the Lightning Style. Your explosives won't detonate against
my Lightning Style. Isn't that your weakness? You...! I see... The Lightning Blade earlier
was to run it through yourself... and you de-triggered the C4
that had entered your body. Yeah... Thanks to that,
my body's in tatters. Although the correct name for
my jutsu is Chidori... He figured out the weakness of
my art in such a short time, and so accurately... When did you realize it? After that blow from the land mine. Although, I've been analyzing it
from the very beginning... Since I countered your first attack
with Chidori Senbon. Among the bombs you created,
some exploded and some didn't. That's when I formulated a hypothesis. Hypothesis...? That time, the only one that exploded
was the one you threw when you tried to evade my attack. All the explosives that I countered with
my Chidori Senbon didn't detonate. However, it was possible that
you purposely didn't trigger them... because they fell close
to your comrade. In other words, you weren't sure
if they didn't detonate because of your Chidori or
because I didn't make them explode. I see... So that's why you tested those
two alternatives on the land mine? Exactly. The key element of the C2
coordinated assault is using the land mines to slow you down and finishing you off with
a pinpoint missile attack. Land mines are planted all around you! Step on one and you'll set them off! If they were self-triggered,
your will was not involved. So I could test if my Lightning Style Jutsu could disarm your Earth Style bombs. That's right. That time I stuck my sword
into the ground... I wasn't verifying the location
of land mines. I shot through them with my sword
tinged with Chidori in order to confirm my theory. But...how?! How could you pinpoint
the position of the landmines?! This eye distinguishes chakra by its color. Didn't I tell you that earlier? You could see the position of
the land mines...?! He wasn't poking into the ground
to test where they were and where he could step? He was checking whether
he could disarm the Detonation Clay... But what would you have done
if the land mines exploded?! It was one or the other.
But I had another back-up plan. Although I didn't have a chance
to demonstrate it... This guy...
He even had another jutsu... Where is Itachi? You may try to look good,
but you're barely managing too. It seems your chakra got drastically low. I win. I still have
Detonation Clay to... Huh?! Under these conditions,
shouldn't you be panicking a little? This time, my art will kill you for sure! That's what pisses me off about you!
Both of you brothers! Don't pretend to be so cool! Those eyes!
That overconfident eye irritates me! As if it denies my art! It's unforgivable! Those eyes which show absolutely
no respect for my art... Those eyes that ignore my art...
are unforgivable! I couldn't care less about such a thing. Never mind that. Tell me where Itachi is. So you've drawn back your Sharingan... You really take me lightly! This is my ultimate art...! Now I will detonate myself. He's...! With death, I will become art. This never-before-seen explosion
will leave a never-before-seen scar on this land. And...! My art will win
never-before-seen admiration! Sorry, Tobi... In the midst of my admiration,
you will definitely die! An explosion that will cover
a ten-kilometer radius... You won't be able to get away! Now, tremble with fear! Be in awe! Despair! Scream! My art is... Ha! An explosion!! Naruto, there are signs that
Sasuke was just here.

 - What?!
- It's very vague, but his scent still lingers.

 I'd say there was a battle here.

 Then let's go after Sasuke immediately!

 We can't.

 Why not?

 The scent stops here.

 In a case like this,

 either Sasuke was erased without
a trace in the explosion, or...

 Next time: "Disappearance"

 Tune in again!

 This is my ultimate art...! Now I will detonate myself. He's...! With death, I will become art. This never-before-seen explosion
will leave a never-before-seen scar
on this land. And...! My art will win
never-before-seen admiration! Sorry, Tobi... Hmm? In the midst of my admiration,
you will definitely die!! An explosion that will cover
a ten-kilometer radius... You won't be able to get away! Now, tremble with fear! Be in awe! Despair!! Scream! My art is... An explosion!! Wha--?! What is that?! What the--?! Kakashi, what is that? This chakra...
It's that Akatsuki member... Wh-What could it be? Let's go check it out! Right! Look! Sasuke... It can't be...! I can't sense Sasuke's chakra! That's near our rendezvous point... Don't tell me he's...! Damn! It's just as I feared! That Deidara...
He blew himself up. Where's Tobi? Probably dead...
He was within the blast range... Disappearance

 Deidara is dead. In the end, he went out with a bang. Oh dear.
Another member has been lost... And I thought he was
pretty strong. So? Which one did him in? Sasuke? Or the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki? It was Sasuke. However... It looks like Sasuke is dead too. Deidara took Sasuke down
with him, huh...? You should feel grateful, Itachi. Deidara did you a favor
and got rid of your problem. Hmm... I feel like
we've forgotten something... Looks like Tobi is dead too. That Deidara detonated himself
without regard for his surroundings. Ah yes, Tobi. It must've been quite a jutsu
if that chicken was unable to escape. No matter...
He can easily be replaced. The loss of Deidara, however,
is unfortunate. I liked Tobi. When it came to lightening the mood
in our rather gloomy organization, Tobi was quite talented. I'm going. I shall mourn Deidara's death in silence. Then I'll mourn for Tobi. You must really be bored, huh? When the crest of
the snake vanishes... Then...I do this... Add a drop of Sasuke's blood... All right. Summoning Jutsu! S-So, this is Orochimaru's
Summoning Jutsu... Manda... Even Orochimaru had trouble
controlling this guy. How did Sasuke manage to...? I see. He used genjutsu... Whoa, you're a mess! Who did you fight? You...had the nerve... to use me... You damned brat... Those eyes...you controlled me...
with those eyes... I...of all...people... Oh-ohh, he's dead. Wasn't Manda Orochimaru's
favorite pet? You ought to treat animals better... And the whole manipulation
with the genjutsu... There wasn't time to think.
I had no choice... Found you! I figured you'd be here! Your chakra suddenly disappeared,
so I wondered what had happened... Did you transport yourself?! You hid yourself inside Manda, then used the Transportation Technique
to escape into another dimension... So why are you in such bad shape? Just before escaping,
we both got hit by the blast wave. My opponent was one of the Akatsuki. He was stronger than I expected... Sasuke all cut up and bruised
is also hot... In any case, he needs time to rest.
Right, Karin? Ahem! How pathetic! And you call yourself the man
who killed Orochimaru?! Orochimaru was already weakened
to begin with. That's all there is to it. It just won't stop. It's strange to have this much rain
around here at this time of year. You'll ruin your health. I don't know what someone as cold as you
could be thinking about right now... But from here,
you look as though you are crying. It's too bad about your younger brother... You are now the sole survivor
of the Uchiha clan. No. Hmm? He's not dead. Also... What do you mean? The rain...has stopped. Naruto! Looks like it caught all our attention. What happened?! There are signs that Sasuke
was just here. It's very faint,
but his scent still lingers. I also detect other scents. What does it mean? From the damage to the terrain,
I'd say there was a battle here. I knew it! One of the other scents
belongs to that fellow in town on whom I detected Sasuke's scent. Huh? Looks like there are others
traveling alongside Sasuke. He has a companion. Then, back there... It's probable that... Sasuke has formed his unit. One of the five other scents belongs
to Deidara from Akatsuki. Wasn't he the one
who self-destructed and was transported to another dimension
by your jutsu, Sensei?! It seems he faked
his own death to escape... The Akatsuki operate in two-man cells,
so there are three left. Sasuke is moving with
a four-man cell. Who cares how many there are. Let's get moving and
trace Sasuke's scent! We can't. Huh? Why not? The scent stops here. What does that mean?! Usually in a situation like this, either Sasuke was blasted to bits
by the explosion... or Sasuke used
the Transportation Technique to escape. Transportation Technique...? It's probably the latter. My sense of smell is keener
than a dog's right now. I've found Sasuke! A nose that's sharper than
the ninja hounds...? Impressive, Kiba. Just what I would expect
from a member of the Inuzuka clan. Kiba, lead the way! Come, Pain... He's here. And...what of Sasuke? He's coming along nicely... He was using the Sharingan's power
to his fullest... His eyes will surpass Itachi's... The time has come.
He must be ready as well. After all, he doesn't have much time. Then what about the Nine-Tails? You hunt it.
As leader, failure is not an option. INN OKOSHI Hah! You talked about killing Itachi... You won't be able to move around
for some time in that condition! We've been moving nonstop lately.
It's a good chance to rest up. All you've done is rest,
you feeble punk! There, finished. You didn't do a thing at
the northern hideout, so don't start telling me
what to do now. What?! Wanna make something of it?! Then let's do it! Enough already! Suigetsu, Karin...
Have you gathered data on Itachi? You're in no shape to act so bossy! I've picked up some tips
about Akatsuki, but nothing specific
about Itachi himself. I got zero. Seems they're targeting
specific people though... People with special chakra. Special chakra...? I did some talking to animals and
located a number of Akatsuki hideouts. It seems they always sense a powerful, unpleasant chakra
around each area. That's what the animals have told me. Wow, even simpleminded animals
can sense chakra, eh...? Or maybe it's because
they're simpleminded... Just like you Karin! What did you say, you jerk?! Suigetsu! This time,
you're not getting away with it! Hey... W-Wait...hey! Kill... I want to kill... - Huh?
- Huh?! INN OKOSHI Shoot! Jugo's killing impulse is loose! Sasuke! Hurry it--! Calm down, Jugo. S-Sorry... It's your fault, Karin.
Screaming and making such a fuss. What? You too... You constantly try to provoke me, Karin. What are you up to? I've already told you. I don't intend to leave Sasuke
for my own reasons. I-I'm not up to anything. I'm just trying to test your... I...I need Sasuke. The only one who can
replace Kimimaro...is Sasuke. Sasuke said he would
become my cage... Right now, only Sasuke can
stop my urges, like he did earlier... Still... I don't know about her,
but our cages are unlocked. We can escape anytime we wish.
And yet... I'm sure of it. It's this way! From his scent,
I can tell he's stopped moving. It seems he's resting. It's our chance. Sasuke...
Our paths have finally crossed. Naruto Uzumaki...
He's no longer just a kid. He has now mastered
a formidable jutsu... and has many comrades. It won't be easy. He even destroyed two of
Kakuzu's lives with a single blow. To speak of the target as
a threat has no meaning before Pain. He has never lost a battle. Well, that's true. We're done talking. Tell the other members to hurry
with the remaining Jinchuriki. I know. At last... We are so close to the moment
of achieving our goal... Then everything shall be restored
to its rightful place... The true power of the Sharingan... The true power of I,
Madara Uchiha! The sky is crying again... Pain... Are you...? I'm coming in, Tsunade!

 Jiraiya? Did you learn anything?

 I discovered the whereabouts
of the leader of "Akatsuki."

 What?! Is that true?!
Tell me more!

 We'll use that information
to plan a surprise attack!

 Now now, don't be hasty.

 This isn't like plotting
a sequel to your novel!

 We don't have the time to waste!

 Haste makes waste.

 Especially with the stakes
as high as they are...

 Next time: "Twilight"

 Tune in again!

 I'm coming in, Tsunade. Jiraiya? Did you learn anything? I discovered the whereabouts
of the Akatsuki leader. What?! Is that true?! Tell me more! We'll use that information
to plan a surprise attack! Don't be hasty, now. This isn't like plotting
a sequel to your novel! We don't have the time to waste! Haste makes waste. Especially with the stakes
this high... Say, why don't we grab
a drink together? Just you and me. I'll tell you everything there. You fool! I am the Hokage! And you're asking me to go
drinking in broad daylight?! Have you no shame when
our ninja are on duty?! SAKE
BAR You know... You really ought to take your own words
a bit more to heart. Drinking sake straight out
of the bottle... Remember, you are the Hokage, right? Twilight

 That girl's late... How long does it take to
pick up supplies...? I wish it would get dark soon... After Jugo and Suigetsu turn in, I'll make my move on Sasuke
while he sleeps! I'm so excited! This feeling... Well, Kiba?! I'm concentrating, trying to
single out Sasuke's faint scent! So shut up! You're distracting me! There's no mistake...
They're steadily approaching. One...two... Their chakra is strong too. There're quite a few. I sense non-human chakra too. Dogs? Are they tracking our scent? Is it Akatsuki?
Or maybe the Hidden Leaf? INN OKOSHI Jugo. I'm gonna go check on Karin. Yeah. Wh-What...? Wake up, Sasuke! We're going to have company!
What do we do?! Sasuke just waking up...is also nice! We escape... Get ready. Jugo, mark every Akatsuki hideout
that we know. You're okay now, Sasuke? Yeah. I've been healing a lot faster
since I absorbed Orochimaru's power. So this is the Power of the White Snake... Whether it's Akatsuki
or the Hidden Leaf, they might have information
on Itachi. So why don't we ambush them, Sasuke? From what you reported about
the number of people, it's most likely the Hidden Leaf. Akatsuki always work
in two-man cells. Which means an ambush
would be a waste of time. Exactly. Forget the Hidden Leaf. Then what'll we do? Itachi is our only priority. Once we locate him,
worse comes to worst, you three must stop
the Hidden Leaf. For now, team "Hebi" will use
the information gathered by Jugo and check out Akatsuki hideouts
one by one. All right... Let's go. Help me out for a second. With that? Can you gather as many birds
as you can? What do you plan on doing? This is Sasuke's old outfit. It's soaked with his sweat
and smell, so we'll use this to... Why would you have an outfit
that Sasuke threw away? Uh...! Th-That...
That's not important... Y-You jerk! A-Anyway... I hate to do this, but... Sensory-Type Ninja have
different specialties depending on their village. The Hidden Leaf often
use ninja hounds. So we'll use that to
our advantage. What's wrong, Kiba? Shoot! Sasuke is starting to move! Let's hurry!
Sasuke is going after Itachi! Hold it, something's wrong! Sasuke's scent is dispersing! Not only that,
it's scattering in all directions! He's on to us.
Taking strategic action. On to us? But how?! I don't know what kind of power. But I'm guessing he has
a skilled Sensory-Type Ninja on his side. The distance is too great, so I can't guide you
through the wireless. I'm the only one
who can pursue him... But it's one scent. What'll we do? I'll find him if I have to search
every blade of grass! With whatever means necessary! Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu! It's up ahead... You guys wait until I give the order.
I'll go and see. Who's that...? Sharingan?! Sasuke?! Th-That's--! Itachi...Uchiha! Come on out... Naruto Uzumaki. You've come to capture me? No...I didn't.
I just came to talk to you. Like I'd ever trust you! When up against the Sharingan, if it's one on one, always run away. If it's two against one,
get his back... But in his case... Even while making a seal, he can put his target under a genjutsu
using only finger movements... I have to be careful! I know that you're alone.
So why don't you run? Hah! My numbers can go from
one to a thousand! Besides, I can't run away! If I capture you, I get to see Sasuke! Why are you so attached to my brother? He's a Rogue Ninja. That's because unlike you... I think of him as a brother
more than you ever would. You're already under my genjutsu. Dammit!! I'll say it again. I just wanted to talk to you
for a moment. This Akatsuki leader is in
the Hidden Rain Village, correct? Yes. But that place conducts thorough checks
of anyone entering and exiting their territory, and they track
how long visitors stay. Just preparing for the Joint
Chunin Exams is difficult each time because the village is
so closed off to others. Doesn't seem like a place where
the Akatsuki leader can move about freely. However...because security is so strict, they're able to keep other nations
from learning about their internal affairs, and hence, keep a lid on any shame. Shame? It seems that land has seen
much internal strife, and the village itself
has been split into two. Word has it that the leader of one side
is also the leader of Akatsuki. That land is surrounded by EARTH
WIND                FIRE
the three great nations
of Earth, Wind and Fire. And from ages past, it has been the battleground
of their conflicts. As a result, there has never been
domestic stability and the number of refugees
is continually on the rise. That is why I will infiltrate and verify the information
we have gathered. Then we can plan strategy... It's too dangerous to go alone! I am one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Leaf. You know what that means as well. I'm sorry... that you always get
the short end of the stick. What's with you?! I'm saying, you were
supposed to be Hokage. The Third Hokage always wanted you
to be the next to-- I was never cut out for
that sort of thing. Being on my own suits me too well... You regretted not being able
to stop Orochimaru. So all that time, you were tracking his movements alone,
isn't that right? I no longer need to do so. That means I get to release
the sequel to my novel sooner. Fact is stranger than fiction, isn't it? Who would have imagined that
Orochimaru would die... Remember how the three of us would
go up against Old Man Third and... The flat-chested Tsunade has
become the big-bosomed Hokage! Times are changing by the second. You were beautiful back then... and now, you're a
fifty-something old granny. It pains me to see how all the memories
of your lost friends and loved ones are stored inside
that big breast of yours. And you know, the number
will continue to grow. I guess I shouldn't
wallow in sadness. My duty is to be a model
for the next generation and to help them. For that, I'd happily give my life. It's what makes us old folks cool, see? Wh-What's going on? Aren't you after me?
Then this is your...! I'm going now... I have an important task to do. Shadow Clone... What was that? Damn! This one's a bust too! What's wrong, Naruto? Oh, nothing... Did something happen? I just tripped. Never mind that.
Kiba, track the next scent. Your drinking habits are
worse than mine... Want to stop and rest somewhere? It's late. We have to go home. - Okay!
- Okay! Hey, wait up! Akatsuki... The leader is capable of organizing
a group so powerful... Who knows how strong he may be? You'll be walking right into
the enemy's territory. Well then... I should set out. Come back alive... If I lost you too... I... You'll cry for me?
That'll make me happy! But I doubt that it'll be
like the time Dan died. You idiot! Then how about making a bet with me? You bet that I will die. After all, you always lose. But if I make it back alive... Joking! I'm just joking! You know, I'm grateful to you. Rejection makes a man stronger. MAKE-OUT PARADISE

In other words,
you can't call yourself a real man unless you can laugh off stuff like that. Better yet, make a joke out it. So a man's duty is to be strong? Kind of... And besides... men aren't the only ones
who seek happiness. Humph... Stop trying to act so cool. Without a woman,
you guys can't be rejected. That's so true. If anything happens,
contact me through your toad. I'll rush over myself. No need for that.
You must not leave here. The village relies on you now. There are other candidates
for Hokage. There can be no stability
if the Hokage keeps changing. Right now, you are the only one
who can be Hokage. There's Kakashi. And eventually, there's also Naruto... You're really sold on Naruto, aren't you? Although, I can understand... Your kid brother Nawaki...
Your sweetheart Dan... - It's my dream to become Hokage.
- It's my dream to become Hokage. And Naruto too... I guess you could say
they chased the same dream. Sure, Kakashi can step in. But Naruto still has a long way to go,
even though you gave him your necklace. You have high hopes
for him too... You taught him the Rasengan. Oh that... Well, call it nostalgia. It reminded me of the days
when I taught Minato. Minato Namikaze...
True, Naruto does resemble him. Minato was a genius that appears
only once in a generation. There won't be another like him. He was kind-hearted,
but had nerves of steel. He rose to become
the Fourth Hokage so swiftly. I've never been a parent, so I don't know
much about these things... but if he had been my son,
I think I'd have been awfully proud. Now that you mention it...
Naruto might not resemble him, after all. Rather than a son
you boast about, he'd be the problem child,
always up to mischief. Naruto is more like his mother... Wasn't she a former kunoichi
from the Land of Eddies...? Yeah... His personality and ninjutsu style
is just like Kushina Uzumaki. Yes...that's her name! That talkative, red-haired rascal...
She was such a tomboy. Kushina grew up to be a beauty,
but Naruto looks like his father. I can see Naruto's father in him... To me, it feels as though
I'm looking at my grandson. It is being passed on... the will of the Leaf,
from the past to the future. I guess I'll be off. Oh, that's right! I had one last warning for you. Huh? Beware of the Foundation. Yeah... I know. Ah... Good then. Farewell. Now, now, now!

 Those from afar, listen carefully! 

 Those up close, come and see! 

 I am the super hot ninja
of the Leaf! 

 I can hear the wild cheers
of all the girls! 

 I may steal your hearts,
but they won't shatter! 

 I help the weak and fight the strong! 

 Now let the tale
of Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls begin! 

 Next time: "Tales of a Gutsy Ninja
~ Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls ~ Part 1"

 TSUNADE'S ROOM Now then, today's guest is... Hold it right there! The most holy hermit sage
of the spirit of Mt. Myoboku Toads! I am the great Master Jiraiya! Oh, it's you. What a greeting!
Aren't you happy to see me? Well, we don't have much to talk about. Don't say that. How about dwelling
into my heroic tales? Heroic tales, huh...? Yeah, something that'll make the women
watching their TV shout for joy. You mean like long ago... for the crime of peeking
into the hot springs... the Third Hokage made
you sit for hours... or the time you had
a book-signing for your first novel... it didn't sell at all and
not one single soul showed up? There must be more than that! Hmm... Can't think of anything. I guess that's all I am to you, huh? - Oh!
- That's right. Tell them that! Time's up. Goodbye. What?! Tune in again!

 Tales of a Gutsy Ninja -
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls - Part 1

 There are two bells... The fact that there are
only two bells means... One person will lose... You're very sharp, Orochimaru. Say! If I get a bell,
you'll go out with me. If you lose,
don't bother me anymore. All right! I'll do it! So many openings... Now! I won the bet, Jiraiya!
You get to go to the log. Shut up, flat-chested plywood Tsunade! What'd you say?!
You egg-headed perv!! Now, now. That's enough... Tsunade and Orochimaru may go. Okay! You are hopeless... How can a ninja keep falling
into such obvious traps?! Can't help it... Perhaps what you lack
is a purpose... Huh?! Let's see now... Yes! We'll try this! Wh-What?! Don't get so excited. Just watch. Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu! Awesome! The Summoning Jutsu... You make a blood contract
with an animal, and summon them at any time
using the Transportation Technique. I want to make a contract
with that one too! That, you can't do. Huh? In the same way that every man
is destined to a different fate, so too is the animal to whom
he is intertwined. Then which is my animal? Before you can make a contract, you need to be more adept
at molding chakra and sealing. What? Not more training! You will always find the answer
in your training! Jiraiya had found a purpose
and from that day on, he began taking
his training seriously. However... Mold more chakra... Study up on sealing... I must master
the Transportation Technique... Dammit! When will I be able to
make a contract? Why do I put up with
this rough training? If I were to have a boyfriend, I'd choose Orochimaru over
an egghead perv like you. The answer is simple! I just have to become
the ultimate ninja and sweep Tsunade off her feet! Now that that's settled,
there's no time to waste! Ah... So he's discovered his purpose
for becoming a ninja. And not just Tsunade, I'm gonna get all the pretty girls
to myself. Let's see...
Concentrate my chakra and... the seal is boar, dog,
bird, monkey, sheep... Wait! There's no telling
what will happen if you use the Transportation Technique
without making a contract first! Go! Where am I...? Hold it right there! I, the great Master Jiraiya,
shall take over this fight! Heh! I guess that'll do! Hmmm... A human child. Huh?! A-A talking toad! And what about you? To think, a human would really
come to Mount Myoboku... What do you mean?! Lord Fukasaku! It's a human child. Oh...so you've arrived. You talk as though
you've been expecting me. Yes, I knew you were coming.
The Great Lord Elder predicted it. A human child will stumble
into Mount Myoboku, and I will give that child the power
of the toad and a prophecy. That is the dream which
I dreamt of myself... My very own prophecy. If that human is me...
then what is my  prophecy?! Well... I don't know. Don't know? You must stay here and train, and wait for
the Great Lord Elder's prophecy. H-Hold it! I made up my mind
to become strong so that I'll be popular with women... There's no point in getting popular
with frogs! Quit complaining!
This is your destiny. My destiny?! Yes. You managed to come
to Mount Myoboku. This is proof that you were indeed
the chosen one. The chosen one, eh? Training here and becoming strong...
That's pretty tempting too. From this day forward,
Jiraiya divided his time between Mount Myoboku, the land of toads,
and the Hidden Leaf Village... He spent the days of his youth
in both Sage and ninjutsu training. However... It was not to be as simple as
Jiraiya had thought. I've definitely gotten stronger
since coming here. But... Tsunade is as cold as ever. Not just that... If I was destined to be
the chosen one, should my purpose simply
be to impress a girl? Is that the only reason why
I'm trying to become strong? Jiraiya! Jiraiya! Yeah? Jiraiya, the Great Lord Elder
has summoned you. The Great Lord Elder...? Hurry up.
He has seen your prophecy! For real, Bunta?! As summoned. Ah, good. I'm glad you've come! Huh? Who're you again? Great Lord Elder, it's Jiraiya!
This is Jiraiya! Oh, that's right! Right!
My, how you've grown... Gah, you're the one who summoned him,
ya great senile old geezer! Senile old geezer?! Ma, how dare ya call
the Great Lord Elder a senile old geezer! Now now, let's not fight.
Spouses oughta get along... By the way... Who're you, again? Jiraiya-boy. The Great Lord Elder had
a dream about you. As you are aware,
it is a prophecy. So listen carefully. Yes, sir! I shall now tell you.
In my dream... you, who are solely pervy, will still
manage to become a splendid ninja. And in time, you will have
your own disciple... Solely pervy...? Can't believe he remembers
that particular detail... That disciple will become a ninja
who will bring about a great change to the ninja world. That is what I saw in my dream. A great change? Either great stability
or great destruction. The likes of which this world
has never seen before. One of those two. One of those two?
What does that mean? You will guide that revolutionary. The day will come when you will
be forced to make a critical selection. Selection? Your choice shall decide
which way the change goes. What must I do...?
In order to make the right choice? In my dream, you traveled the world,
writing books. Books? Whatever for? I do not know either. Perhaps it will be a journey
around the world to see all things in nature. Great Lord Elder, have your prophecies
ever not come to pass? No, never. Jiraiya, you are leaving? Yup! At this point in my life, there's no way I can guide someone
who will be a revolutionary... Let alone make the right choice. Hmm... I guess I need more time
to see many more things, and meet different people. I see... Just like in
the Great Lord Elder's dream, I shall journey throughout the world
and perhaps, write a book. It seems that is my destiny. While Jiraiya journeyed and
searched for the meaning behind the Great Lord Elder's dream, the state of the world grew
steadily more chaotic. The peace that had prevailed among
the Five Great Nations became fragile. Aggression between lands
increased as did internal strife, and the people began to suffer. Young man...
Why are you traveling? I'm searching for my destiny. Oh...? Someone saw me in a dream. And just like in that dream,
I journey from land to land. Oh my, what's the matter...? Here, have one. It's milk candy. A puppet? Oh, this child tells me...
Destiny is not something you search for! Destiny is something you latch onto
when it presents itself. The age of war is coming. Mechanical skills are useless
in times of peace, but some feudal lord may pay
a high price for my services. So he is a ninja too... He has chosen to ride the wave
to the age of destruction. But that will only... Let's have more fun. Come on. Mmmm... What are you writing? Just scribbling...
that riding on the wave of the times will not result in the revolutionary
change needed for peace. Say, say! If you're gonna
change something, change me! I suppose you're right.
That does sound more fun. This is fraud! As if I'll pay for something like this! Hold it right there! I shall take over this fight! Damn it! How can fate be so cruel?! I worked hard on cultivating the land
with what little knowledge I had. All for the sake of my clan, and yet... So this fellow is dissatisfied with
the way the world is going... Have a drink... I've been searching for
my destiny too, but it's very elusive. Humph... It's useless to search
for something like that. My people have no chance against the ninja villages
of the Great Nations... This guy...
Is that all he can do...complain? You are wrong... Huh? I teach children in a village... about how to fight back
when faced with a harsh fate. So education could end a war? Cut the pretty talk! What?! Is he a ninja too? No, that it cannot... However, perhaps I can
teach them skills that enable them
to make better choices. Let me ask you...
What are those choices? Life or death...
Those are the choices. The only thing I can teach them
is how to survive. That's not good enough. I must choose the revolutionary
who will bring peace to the world. To bring destruction upon this world. Or to bring about a peace which
we have never known before... That depends on the commitment
of each and every person! Hmm... Could this person be...? Say, you! You just might be the person
I've been looking for! Oh...? What would you do in order
to bring peace to this world? The world is heading towards
an age of war and strife... There's no stopping it. You just said it depends on
each person's commitment, didn't you? How do we change
these people's destinies? Just pray hard.
That is all men can do. This man is not the one...either. What was that?! This is just an ordinary village!
Why would a ninja...?! This shuriken jutsu... You are from the Fuma, aren't you?! Why attack people who
are living in peace?! You are also a ninja. I am journeying in search of the one
who will become my disciple. Humph! Why waste time
on such a tedious thing?! The balance of power between
lands has become shaky and we are on the verge of
a great war... That village was also destroyed due
to a tip that ninja had infiltrated it. Just because of a tip?! It's destroy, or be destroyed. We live in a world where
you'll die if you hesitate! A Smoke Bomb! You're pretty good. If you are a ninja too,
I cannot let you live. Just give up...
This is our fate as ninja. Can I say something? I don't feel like listening... Just...die!! Give up... ...on me giving up! Even if you bring me down, another assassin will attack
the village... As long as we are cursed to live
in this ninja world, there will be no peace. The Great Toad Sage's
prophecy said that I am destined to train the revolutionary
who will bring peace to this world. However, I haven't even encountered
this disciple. Already at this time,
battles were inevitably being fought. Jiraiya was also forced to take
a short break from his journey and returned to the Hidden Leaf Village. We're at war...after all. Orochimaru... In order to erase this sadness
from the ninja world... I must find the revolutionary... I must choose the one
who will bring peace. The flames of war finally drew
in Jiraiya and his comrades. This would come to be known
as the Third Great Ninja War. Shortly afterwards, the three
would come to be known as the "Legendary Sannin." Boy, it's not easy coming up with
ideas for writing a book.

 The main hero of this book has
seen too much of the ninja world,

 where battle brings
further battle.

 It's a world filled with hate.

 I want him to somehow
wipe away the hate

 and create a world of peace, yet...

 Aaah! It's so hard to build up
a story to the climax!

 What shall I do?!

 Next time: "Tales of a Gutsy Ninja -
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls - Part 2"


 Tune in again!

 Tales of a Gutsy Ninja -
Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls -Part 2

 I predict the Hidden Leaf shall
emerge victorious from this battle. Therefore, I shall let you three live. We don't want your sympathy!
We can still fight! Jiraiya, stop! You three are strong... You survived even this battleground. I, Hanzo, hereby name you
the "Hidden Leaf's Sannin." In exchange for your lives,
tell me your names. Will it really end with
the Hidden Leaf's victory like he said? And if it does, then what?
Will you set out on another journey? Maybe... Set out on my travels and
write another book... Why won't you settle down
in the village? I feel as though
I haven't encountered it yet. You mean, your destiny? Quiet! They're just kids. Don't let your guard down. Even little mice can be from
the Hidden Rain Village. Don't hide. Show yourself! What do you want? Give me some food! What about your parents? They were killed by ninja
because of this war. Here...have some bread. Nagato, Konan, come on out!
They don't seem like bad guys. Hey! We already gave you food!
Why are you following us?! Thank you. This is for you... It's origami...
folded from the bread wrapping. This is for us? Teach us ninjutsu... You're all ninja from
the Hidden Leaf, right? Shall I kill these children? Wha--?! I've seen many war orphans.
It's pitiful. They would be better off if we just put them out of
their misery right now... Orochimaru, enough!
You go on ahead with Tsunade. I'll stay here and look after them
for a while. Huh?! Just until they can take better
care of themselves... It is the least I can do. But... This is also part of destiny... Thank you for the food! Grilled fish in an instant with
my Fire Style Jutsu. Mm... Delicious! Sensei! I've gotten the hang of fishing! Hmm? What's the matter, Nagato? I just remembered my family... And... Stop crying! You're a man! It's because of guys like you that men of the Hidden Rain
are considered cowards! Things are unstable among
three of the Great Nations that surround the Hidden Rain Village. But this war won't drag out much longer. By the time you are grown, there will be mutual understanding
and peace will- That's not fair! We all lost our families! If there is a mutual understanding, it's only after they go through
what we did! That's what it means to get even, right?! But...I know that's impossible. That's why wars will never end! I hate rain. This land is always crying. It's a coward! I'm gonna change this land. I'll protect everyone! That's why Jiraiya Sensei...!
Please teach us ninjutsu! I don't have any ideas for my novel... If there is a mutual understanding, it's only after they go through
what we did! That's why wars will never end! I'll protect everyone!! I want the hero to wipe away
the hatred and bring about peace... Now then...how can I...? Jiraiya Sensei, help!
Yahiko and Nagato are in trouble...! Lead the way, Konan!! I brought Sensei! What happened? This... This leftover ninja told us to hand
over our food...and valuables. Then Nagato... He's a chunin from the Hidden Stone... How did Nagato...? Th-Those eyes...!! He couldn't...possibly be...! That shape... That ripple pattern...
I can't believe it! That eye... Said to hold the most noble of
the three great Visual Jutsu... The Rinnegan! The Sage of the Six Paths,
said to be the father of all ninja... It is said that the Sage possessing
the Rinnegan eye developed all the jutsu known to us today. Rumored to always appear
when the world becomes corrupt, capable of being both
a godlike force of creation and an all-obliterating instrument
of destruction. I always believed it as a mere legend. But here is someone who actually
possesses the Rinnegan! I shall now tell you...
In my dream... You, who are solely pervy, will still manage
to become a splendid ninja. And in time, you will have
your own disciple... That disciple will become a ninja who
will bring about a great change to the ninja world. That is what I saw in my dream. You will guide that revolutionary... The day will come when you will be
forced to make a critical selection. Could Nagato be this revolutionary? Perhaps I have found my destiny. I've decided to teach you ninjutsu. R-Really?! You may encounter another life-threatening
situation like that last time. It is ninjutsu for self-defense. Yes! Thanks for saving us last time, Nagato!
Sorry I called you a coward! Next time anything happens,
I'll protect you! Th-Thanks, Yahiko. Huh...? But Nagato is stronger
than you, Yahiko! I'm gonna train starting now
and I'll become stronger! You always exaggerate, Konan! All right, let's start! The first lesson is on molding chakra. - Yes, Sensei!
- Yes, Sensei! Something's bothering you, eh? Talk to me. Sensei... Is it about that incident? That day... When that man hurt Yahiko,
I was so mad at him. Everything went blank in my head...
I didn't know what I was doing. Before I realized it, the man was dead... After that, I got so scared. This hatred made me lose myself...
and I killed someone. What I did was wrong!
There had to be a better way--! Nagato... I really don't know
if it was right or wrong. But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die. You protected your friend. That had to be the right thing to do. No one can blame you for that. When you are hurt, you learn to hate. On the other hand, when
you hurt someone, you are resented. But you start to feel guilty as well. Understanding such pain enables
you to be kind to others... That's what makes us human. What do you mean by that...? It's called growing up. Growing up? What do you mean? That, you need to figure out yourself. Konan and I were crying
because we were so hungry and Yahiko saved us. He stole food from others to feed us. I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. I see. "TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA" BY JIRAIYA Water Style: Raging Waves! Paper Shuriken! Wind Style: Gale Palm! We did it! How's that, Sensei?! You're even able to take down
my Shadow Clone now, eh? Now I can return to my village
without any worries. - Huh?
- Huh? You are on your own from now on. You've done well these past three years! Don't cry, Yahiko.
Or people will call you a coward. Konan... You're gonna grow up
to be a beauty. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. This is a poor land. And there's more sadness
and tough times up ahead. But now, you have the strength
to change this land. Nagato... You three have grown up. Don't you agree? Thank you, Sensei. Even after Jiraiya returned to the village,
the Third Great Ninja War raged on. Tsunade! Orochimaru! Ready?! Yeah! - Summoning Jutsu!
- Summoning Jutsu! The Hidden Leaf's Sannin distinguished
themselves in many battles... leaving legends in their wake. All this fighting...
How long must it continue? What must be done to stop the war? Humph... As if there's a way to stop it. Hate only gives birth
to even more hate. But...! I don't know how to stop it.
But peace will certainly come. As long as there are those who
believe that, there is hope. Oh, what's the matter? What's wrong? Those three have died. I've tried my best to make
the right choices. I believed that was what destiny
had in store for me. Jiraiya... And finally...
I thought I did what was right. But perhaps,
I was wrong yet again. You'll find it
as long as you keep believing. Yes... I guess I'm still in
the middle of my journey. The Third Great Ninja War dragged on and the one who guided
Hidden Leaf Village to victory was another one of Jiraiya's disciples...
Minato Namikaze. That was long. Too long... What will you do from now on? Let's see...
Maybe set out on another journey. Maybe I'll find a disciple who
can change the world. Is that your destiny?
The destiny of Jiraiya? Well, I guess you could say that... Humph... What a strange man you are. Hmm? You walk the path of the ninja. Don't you want someone
to take over after you? To gather all the jutsu in this world
and master them... That is my only goal. Even if you master them all,
humans are not immortal. She's right. I wonder about that... TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA Give it up. Can I say one thing? I don't care to listen!! Die already! Give up... ...on me giving up! Even if you bring me down, another assassin
will attack the village... As long as we are cursed to live
in this ninja world, there will be no peace. Then...I'll break that curse! If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! Wh-Who are you...? My name is... Oh...you were reading my
"Tales of a Gutsy Ninja"? But it's my first published work. The sentences are childish
and I didn't do a good job. No, I don't think so.
This tale is wonderful! Oh...? Each chapter reads like one
of your numerous legendary exploits. It's almost like an autobiography. But...it didn't sell at all. For my next one, I think I'll add some
sexy elements to spice it up a bit. The main character of this book... I thought his determination to
never give up was really cool. He's a lot like you, Sensei. Y-You think so...? So I was thinking. Huh? I really hope my unborn child
can become a ninja just like this main character! Which is why I'd like your permission
to name my son after him. H-Hey! Are you sure? It's just a random name that I thought up
while eating ramen. Naruto... It's a wonderful name. Kushina... Cripes... So that makes me
his godfather? Are you really sure about this? You are my sensei! And you are a great ninja who possesses
the true talent of a ninja! There's no other like you. Even after this... Jiraiya continued his journey
in search of his destiny. It would be a little later before
Jiraiya would meet Naruto in the Village Hidden in the Leaves. What's going on here?!

 It's great that I got in so easily, 

 but who is this Pain
that everybody speaks of?! 

 All I get from the villagers are
vague descriptions such as "god" or "angel."

 And I don't know the whereabouts
of the former village leader, 

 Hanzo of the Salamander. 

 But there's no time to waste...

 Guess I'll go with that plan! 

 Next time:
"Infiltrate! The Village Hidden
in the Rain"

 Tune in again!

 Infiltration is a success.
That was quite easy. Now then... What is it? Someone is disturbing my rain. This chakra... He is strong. All right, where do I search first? Hot, hot! I'll have one of these, Granny... Thank you. I haven't seen your face before. You're not from around here? Well... I'm a writer. I travel around and write about regional cuisine and
products for a magazine. Hmm... I see.
And how do you like my pork buns? Oh, they're delicious. I heard about them,
and they're amazing. I know! Aren't they? I'd like to introduce them
in our magazine. Is that okay? In a magazine? Yes. Although, once I write about them, you'll have such a big crowd
you won't be able to rest. I-I see. That would be a problem! It sure is peaceful around here. Yes. This village is no longer plagued by war
thanks to Lord Pain. We're so grateful to him. Pain? Yes, Lord Pain. What happened to
Hanzo of the Salamander? Huh? Hanzo of the... Thanks for your time, Granny. "THE ORIGINAL"
PORK BUNS Thank you for waiting. Say... What is that? Huh? Oh, that is Lady Angel. You don't know? They say it's good fortune to
put up origami shaped after the Lady Angel
at the shop entrance. An Angel... What is going on?
This land isn't divided into two. Instead it's already united. And the Hidden Rain Village
used to have a leader named Hanzo of the Salamander... It seems I need to check
this place out very thoroughly. MAKE-OUT PUB WAR Looks like it's going to be
an intense battle! Oh sir... Surely, you jest... No, I can't tell lies. All of it is true. Is that so? I'm flattered. Oh, what an intense battle this is! You have good taste for
choosing me, Mister. Well Tezuna, you look just
like someone I know... Your names are similar too,
so I couldn't help but request for you. It was well worth the long journey here. Oh, you're not from around here? Hmm, well I heard there might be work
for a mercenary like me, so I came. If I recall,
it was Hanzo of the Salamander who... Shh! Don't talk about such things here! Oh...? Why not? If they think you're one of
Hanzo's associates, you'll be killed! Oh... That's disturbing news! The new leader, Lord Pain, is very strict... He'll show no mercy to
anyone he suspects. That is what my hubby says. What?! Are you married, Tezuna? Well... My hubby is just a village genin
and doesn't earn much. I have to work. That's harsh... According to my hubby, Lord Pain makes it rain
in this village with his jutsu. The rain can tell him
what everybody is doing. Hmm... That's a scary jutsu. So it's better to watch
what we talk about. Tezuna! Excuse me a minute. So I'm already under his watch... "I'm coming home now with
a present"? Yeah right. He's probably buying something
at the gift shop by Shibuki Bridge! Hmph! What a sad piece of writing... Konan... When I stop the rain,
seek out the intruder with your jutsu. Got it. Ready? Yes... What a downpour. Wanna get a drink while
we wait for the rain to stop? There are no bars at
a low ground level like this. We'll have to go up higher. Then let's head upwards
for some cover. But are you sure? Didn't you tell your wife
you're heading straight home? Heh! It's okay.
It's an emergency mission! I never heard of drinking
being a mission... GRAND OPENING
CLUB FROG Heh heh... We're in luck. Welcome. Just two. Give us sake and some chasers. Today's not Sunday, is it? Something must have come up
for Lord Pain. Maybe he's leaving for another nation. But it never rained on other days before. Maybe it's something that
requires that much power. But if it keeps on raining like this... Hey! Careful with the words! Lord Pain works tirelessly
for the people of this village. Show some tolerance! Guess you're right... Sorry to keep you fellows waiting. Hey... But there's nothing! No, no... You're in luck! Today, we have
our grand opening special. What? Really?! What kind of service? The Club Frog Special Torture Service. You...! Who the hell are you?! I'm the one asking the questions.
And I have a lot to ask. Now! Run! What?! Give it up. "Infiltrate!
The Village Hidden in the Rain"

 Do it, Konan. Right... Now then... From your use of kunai,
I'm guessing you two are lowly ninjas. Am I correct? Does that rogue ninja mark signify
that you're loyal to Pain? Dammit! Where are we?! Inside the belly of a frog. You'll never be found here...
No one will come to your aid! Who the hell are you?! I told you I'll be the one
asking questions. Remember? Wh-What're you gonna do
with that feather? Tickle you! If you don't want to die laughing,
then you'll answer my questions. Regarding your leader...Pain. Now talk! Tell me everything
you know about Pain! Bear with it! I won't...rat...on my comrade... You're pretty stubborn, aren't you? Well, I have another trick. Wh-What're you gonna do?! If you refuse to talk, then I'll use my jutsu
and flog  you to frogs! Flog...you...to frogs... What do you want from us?! Now talk! We may be lowly ninjas,
but we'll never betray our comrades! No matter what you do to us!
So don't take us lightly! Hmm... Then I have no choice... Ninja Art! Toad Transformation! Stop!! You bastard! That's not fair! Now then, you're next. Are you ready? The highest tower in the west...
Lord Pain is there. That's what people say... Huh? What?! You sure turned
on him easily...didn't you? Well, no matter... What did you mean by,
"that's what people say"? Actually... No one really knows
that much about Lord Pain. What do you mean? They say he is from Fuma Clan lineage. But no one really knows
what he looks like. And some claim that
he doesn't even exist. I walked through the town a bit...
and everyone seems to worship him. So don't lie! In this town, Lord Pain is a god. It's not a question of whether
he exists or not. He always watches over us. He has a representative do
all the ceremonial rites, the speeches and the issuing of orders... Through the Lady Angel! Lady Angel...? He's your leader, isn't he? Why must he hide his appearances
from you too? For times like this one. I see... You're not a remnant of
the old Hidden Rain, are you? Just who are you? Never mind about me. What's this about
the old Hidden Rain remnants? Heh... You really don't know
a thing, do you? So you're an outsider. Until recently,
those remnants would infiltrate. But that's not a worry anymore. Only lucky fellows like you ever
manage to slip in from the outside. Not a worry? What do you mean? I heard that this land was
going through a civil war... It's not surprising that you haven't heard. This nation is closed to the outside. Well, I'll tell you... The civil war ended long ago.
And we won! That's why Lord Pain is legendary. He destroyed the Hidden Rain...
by himself. I can't believe it... No matter how powerful
this Pain might be, the leader of the Hidden Rain
was Hanzo of the Salamander. And there's not a soul in
the ninja world that doesn't know him. That's right. But not only was Hanzo powerful,
he was extremely cautious and made it very difficult for anyone
to approach him. He had bodyguards on 24-hour duty,
and everyone, including children, who went near him were strip searched. So how did he defeat Hanzo?
What ability does Pain possess? I told you. We don't know anything! To think you would drive me
into a corner... You are young, but capable. I predict the Hidden Leaf shall
emerge victorious from this battle. Therefore, I shall let you three live. We don't want your sympathy!
We can still fight! Jiraiya, stop! You three are strong. And you managed to survive
and give me a tough time. I will give you time. Become stronger and
come fight me again! In exchange for your lives,
tell me your names. Jiraiya! Tsunade! Orochimaru... Your names have been carved
into my memory... Jiraiya! Tsunade! Orochimaru! I, Hanzo, hereby name you
the "Hidden Leaf's Sannin." I can't believe it...
He defeated Hanzo by himself? He's a god. He wields formidable jutsu. But that is not why Lord Pain
is to be feared. What is truly frightening is
his merciless heart of steel. Everyone who threatened his ideals
was ruthlessly extinguished. He didn't stop with just Hanzo. Hanzo's parents, his wife and child... His relatives and friends,
and even their infants, were killed. Then he burned down their homes. And he killed the emissaries of villages
allied with Hanzo. He erased them all. It was retribution... Just like a god, don't you think? A god... Yes... Then, just what is your god
trying to accomplish? Even underlings like you must know. It's the work of a god.
We wouldn't know what he plans. I see... Then if not god... you must at least know
something about the Akatsuki. Never heard of such a name. Your arms and legs are bound,
so that you cannot move. But that's not all... Your pulse is being measured. And if you lie, I'll know instantly. Tell me everything you know! Otherwise, you will end up surviving off
dragonflies and flies for the rest of your life. Now then...
Time to hunt the infiltrator. I taught you ninjutsu to enable you
to live through those harsh times.

 You were all, without a doubt,
my students. 

 The world may still be a cruel place,

 but to attack me without a greeting...

 This is too sad. 

 You know nothing about what happened
to us afterwards.

 No, I don't. However, what the Akatsuki
is doing is wrong! 

 That is the decision I've made,
Jiraiya Sensei.

 Next time:
"The Man Who Became God" 

 Hehe, a date with Sakura tonight! It's because you said it's lonely
to go to the festival alone! Hey, I smell ikayaki! You're treating! Hey, wait Sakura! - Yay, choco-banana!
- Roger... - Hey, yakisoba!
- Roger! - Takoyaki!
- Roger! - Yo-Yo fishing!
- Roger... - Yay, candy apple!
- I'm cashed-out... It's gotten quiet, hasn't it? - Huh?!
- Huh?! - It can't be a ghost...
- Of course not. Ghost! Sakura! What do you think you're doing?! B-But you...! Huh? I hope we can see the fireworks together
like this next year too. Yeah!


 Tune in again! 



﻿1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Don't tell me you're... It appears that you've remembered... Have we met before...? It looks like the freak beast's intelligence
is at the level of a beast too... Well... I'll make you remember soon... Itachi... Ah, so he is that brat...
who killed his entire clan. It's been a while, Mr. Kakashi, Naruto... <i>A Sharingan...
Just like Sasuke's!</i> <i>He is the...one who's tormenting
Sasuke and Naruto.</i> You bastard... Not just me, but Gaara too! I will destroy you guys! Everyone! Don't look directly
at his eyes! It's dangerous! <i>A Meeting with Destiny
  
  
</i> So this is the Akatsuki! Water Style:
Exploding Water Shock Wave! He's coming! Yes! Here I go! Itachi's Genjutsu is Visual Jutsu. Therefore, it's a type where one gets
caught by his sight, so it'll be okay as long as we don't make
eye contact with him. Yeah, I know! But then... How should we fight him? Well... <i>Guy, how did you fight with Itachi?</i> <i>Huh?</i> <i>Well...</i> Decipher his actions just by how
he moves his body and feet. That seems pretty hard. The Uchiha clan, eh? It's been a while since
I went up against a Sharingan. You don't have to be that surprised. There are a few fighting techniques
to counter this Visual Jutsu. What should we do? "If it's one against one,
then you must flee." "If it's two against one,
then take the back." Say what? You know what "if it's one against one,
then flee" means right? There is no way you can win. But if it's two against one... If it's two against one, even if one is caught by the Genjutsu,
the other will take his back and hit him. Then the Genjutsu will cease. Even if that is impossible, if you hit your teammate,
then you can end the Genjutsu. So, if there is more than one of us,
then one will distract him. The rest of us will constantly
attack him from the back where the Sharingan can't see. I see. Amazing, you know a lot from old age! Then I'll take his back-- Wait! Neji! Lee! So...how is it? Doesn't it remind you?! How can he let out this much water? This technique requires
a huge amount of Chakra. Kakashi Sensei,
what do you mean by wait?! Do you want to say my way of fighting
the Sharingan is wrong? That would work
if it's an ordinary Genjutsu, but it's a bit more complicated
in his case. What? He uses Mangekyo Sharingan which is a much stronger Visual Jutsu
than an ordinary Sharingan. If you receive his Visual Jutsu, then you will experience
his Genjutsu in a second. In other words, even though it may seem
like a second to others, the person who receives the Jutsu
will feel it for hours or days. In my case, I roamed around in
his Jutsu for three days, and lost consciousness
for more than a week. It's not a matter of ending
or not ending the Genjutsu. He's troublesome...
Who exactly is this guy? Impressive Kakashi. It seems you didn't suffer
my Tsukiyomi, Nightmare Realm, in vain. That is not all that I know... After you used the Visual Jutsu,
you were quite exhausted and you ended the battle immediately
and tried to leave. <i>But Itachi...</i> <i>Even for you, it is dangerous
to use that "eye" too much...</i> <i>We did not come here to fight.</i> <i>Unfortunately, anything more than
this is nonsense. Let's go.</i> In addition to using up quite
a lot of Chakra, it seems it comes with some risk
to your "eye" as well, Itachi. From just one match,
you have analyzed it quite well. Hey Itachi. Your eyesight...
How much has it weakened? Kakashi... Could it be that you...? Where is he? Guy Sensei! Tenten! A Water Clone! You didn't even have time to recall. <i>It seems like Itachi also has come
into contact with the enemy...</i> <i>Kisame is in the middle of a fight.</i> Lee! Leaf Rising Wind! What?! 8 Trigrams: Air Palm! It's programmed. Damn! I let him get away! Where did he go? Neji, where's the enemy's location? In front! He's coming up. I found him! Seriously... What troublesome brats. It's so bothersome. The Water Style Ninjutsu
and that big sword... You are...! It seems like you have
finally remembered. I do feel like we have met somewhere. You still can't remember, huh... <i>You really are  good
at hurting people's feelings.</i> Until you recall... I will take my time putting you
through pain. I underestimated you back then.
But I'm not that pathetic. It's not going to work
the way it did before, you see. It's a huge mistake if you think
I'm the same as before! Naruto, I'll deal with him. <i>This happened before too.</i> <i>Form the Manji.
You guys look after Tazuna.</i> <i>Don't get involved in the fight.</i> <i>Huh?</i> <i>And work as a team here.</i> Y-You mean another
non-fighting teamwork? No. This time, cover me. To be honest, I want to be cool
and say, "Go on ahead," but... Against him,
even I can't contain him alone. Let's see... It's time for a counterattack.
First, I'll get him off guard. If I succeed, don't hesitate to attack. - Roger!
- Roger! Do you think you'll get me
off guard that easily? I will quickly change your mind. Gentle Fist! I see... You swing that heavy sword so easily
and you don't get caught off guard. If close battle does not work... How's that? Did you do something? What an annoying sword. Oh yeah, that sword...! Did you recall? That's your weapon, huh? You can tell by looking. But there is a big difference
between knowing it <i>and really  knowing it.</i> As expected Guy Sensei...
Each word holds a deep meaning. Why now for god's sake?
Can you quit being amazed every time? Forget it, Tenten. Let me take back what I said. It seems like your intelligence
is less than an animal. Here we go! Dynamic action! It's about time for you to come with me... Naruto. I'll go first! Shadow Clone?! Rasengan! <i>This is also a Shadow Clone!</i> Sakura! Granny! Sakura...? Now! Water Clone Jutsu! What?! Water Prison Jutsu! Damn it! Lee! Neji! Tenten! Kakashi Sensei! What's going on? <i>Hello kids, thanks for coming to
the Kisame aquarium today.</i> <i>The show you've been waiting for
is about to begin.</i> <i>The five sharks led by this aquarium's
fabulous leader</i> <i>Shark Boy and Brother Guy.</i> <i>Before that, here are some warnings.</i> <i>Those in the front row should
watch out for the water splash.</i> <i>Okay everyone;
let's yell as loud as we can.</i> <i>Okay ready, Shark Boy!</i> Next time: "Naruto's Growth" Do you want to end up like this too? If you don't talk, you'll end up living on dragonflies
and flies for the rest of your life too. Turn me into a frog or whatever!
I'm not saying anything more! Even underlings have pride.
I'm a ninja too! There's nothing I have to say
to an outsider who knows nothing about our nation! Hmm... Still a ninja
even if an underling, eh? Well... I'm not too keen about
interrogation either. Talk is over. However, you're going
to stay right here. I'll go ask this god of yours in person. Jiraiya! What's the big idea,
summoning me?! If it's about the key to Naruto's... No, no. It's not about training. I have my reasons, but I thought of
releasing you for the time being. Release me? What's going on? I'm about to fight
a pretty tough opponent. So tough that you needed to release me? It's just a precaution. Anyway, I wish to press
the storage release seal now. Very well. There! How long until you return? I don't think it'll take too long... However, if anything happens to me,
go store yourself inside Naruto. Are you crazy?! The key that corresponds to
Naruto's Eight-Signed Seal is transcribed on my belly! Each year,
the Fourth Hokage's seal weakens! The key remains in order to re-seal it
when it becomes necessary! To place such a key right next
to the safe is unheard of! Still, Minato entrusted it to us. It was always meant to be
returned to Naruto. It's too soon! Once you talked me into loosening
the Tetragram Seal... You haven't forgotten
what the results were, have you?! Yeah... However, the fact that Minato left me
the jutsu for the key convinces me... that he intended for Naruto
to perfect that jutsu one day. That jutsu? Are you serious? Yes. Does Naruto even require such a jutsu? He would never be able to
control the Nine-Tails' chakra. Not only that... When that key was loosened,
Naruto's own chakra was thrust aside and a large amount of
the Nine-Tails' chakra leaked out. The Nine-Tails nearly
took control of Naruto. If the seal weakens any further and the Nine-Tails completely
overtakes Naruto, it will be totally against
the will of the Fourth Hokage! Minato used the Reaper Death Seal only
on the Nine-Tails' yin chakra. He purposely split the Nine-Tails' power
into yin and yang, and sealed the yang power into Naruto. He wanted to leave
the Nine-Tails' chakra to Naruto. Still...! Why did Minato go so far as sealing the Nine-Tails' chakra
into his own son? Who knows? Maybe it just turned out
that way by coincidence... Or perhaps, as a parent, he wanted
to pass on the power to his son. I know because I was Minato's teacher. Hmm? He never did anything without
good reason. Minato must have known
something important. And he entrusted the Nine-Tails' power
to his own son because of that. I think you're reading too much into it. Do you really think so? The Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that
attacked the Hidden Leaf Village long ago is said to have been a natural disaster. Lately, I've begun to suspect
that it wasn't a natural phenomenon. It may have been manually summoned. You fool! It has always been known that the Nine-Tails is a natural disaster
that mysteriously appears whenever humanity becomes
steeped in evil! Besides, there is no one
in this world powerful enough to summon the likes of the Nine-Tails! That's the thing.
There was  one person. Huh?! Who? The founder of the Uchiha Clan... Madara Uchiha. You fool! Madara Uchiha lived
during the era when the Hidden Leaf Village
was established! He wouldn't have been alive
fifteen, sixteen years ago! Indeed. And everyone knows that the First Hokage defeated
Madara Uchiha at the Final Valley. So your theory is pointless. Perhaps... But I just have this feeling... that fills me with unease. You return to the Leaf Village. When you get there, see Ibiki.
He already knows you're coming. I'm counting on you... Now then, I hope this works. Here I go! "The Man Who Became God"

 Well? It's Jiraiya. I see... Jiraiya Sensei, huh? How nostalgic... What'll you do, Pain? He's not on our side, right? Probably not... Then we'll kill him.
It's far too late for regrets. I came forth in this body in order
to kill the intruder. Take me to him. All right. Pain... I'll handle him until you arrive. Kill him if you can. Fire Style! Flame Bombs! Toad Subjugation...
Art of the Manipulated Shadow, huh? I was hoping to lure out
a fellow named Pain, but little did I expect you
to take the bait. You've honed your jutsu magnificently. But even more,
you've become quite a catch, Konan! I thought you had died... Instead, you turned into
a flimsy sheet of paper. You're his messenger...
The Lady Angel! And now, an angel? Which means, Konan, you're the messenger for
this so-called god? This guy is an intruder! You should kill him now! Move away. Y-Yes! Who is Pain? It's none of your business, Sensei. And that makes you an angel...? Does putting on an act like that
have its benefits? I have received orders from our god.
I will kill you. Toad Oil Bombs! Can't spread your wings
with all that oil, can you? You used to love origami, and you were the kindest
among the three kids. What became of the other two? Nagato...and Yahiko? I heard they had died.
Were they just rumors too? I see...
So this Pain is one of them, eh? What's your purpose? Appearing before us
after all these years... That wasn't my intention. If you all hadn't been part
of the Akatsuki... I heard that you had died.
I never expected this. I bet now you're thinking... You should've done what that
Orochimaru suggested back then... Shall I kill these children? Wha--?! I've seen many war orphans.
It's pitiful. They would be better off if we just put them
out of their misery right now... You saved us instead. But it's too late now... We've embraced his ideology
and made our move. I don't regret letting you live at all. But I'm so disappointed... I taught you ninjutsu to enable you
to live through those harsh times. You were all, without a doubt,
my students. The world may still be a cruel place,
but to attack me without a greeting... This is too sad. For a few years after that time,
I heard your names mentioned. You had made a reputation for
yourselves in a few confrontations, but I heard later that you had died. You know nothing about what happened
to us afterwards. No, I don't. But why the Akatsuki?! What the Akatsuki is doing is wrong! That is the decision I've made... Jiraiya Sensei. You look very different.
But those eyes... That shape... That ripple pattern...
I can't believe it! That eye... The Rinnegan...! So you were Pain... Nagato! It seems you've strayed off
the path of good. What happened? You don't need to know.
After all, you are an outsider. You've changed, Nagato. Summoning Jutsu! Whoa! Foam! Leave it to my student
to know my weakness! He intends to wash away the oil. Konan, stay back. Art of the Raging Lion's Mane! Nagato... I want to ask you a few things. What happened to Yahiko? Oh yeah...
There was such a guy, wasn't there? He died a long time ago. Nagato... You...?! I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. I see. What happened to you?
The old you wouldn't... Nothing... Just war. Too many people die here.
That pain made me grow up. What do you mean? Even a stupid, foolish kid will grow up
when he learns what pain is. Knowing pain controls one's words
and thoughts. But abandoning one's love for a friend... Is that what it means
to become an adult? Sensei... You are still just a man. However, through this never-ending pain... I have matured and become
even more than a man. What? Yes... From a man... to a god. When one becomes a god,
your words and thoughts become absolute. Sensei, since you are human it can't be helped
if you don't understand what I'm saying. Have you become that twisted? Things I couldn't see when I was human
are clear to me now that I am a god. And being a god, I realize that there are things
I can do which man cannot. To put it simply, evolving beyond man. Just what are you planning to do? I am going to put an end to
this senseless, war-torn world. That is a god's work. If that is your purpose,
why are you gathering Tailed Beasts? You are going to die anyway. So I shall tell you the true purpose. I will use the Sealed Tailed Beasts...
to develop a new Forbidden Jutsu. With just one such jutsu, a large nation can be
destroyed instantaneously. It will be the most powerful,
the ultimate Forbidden Jutsu weapon. How will making such a thing
end the fighting? Won't it simply intensify the conflicts? There are disputes
throughout the nations. How would you put a quick end
to them all, Jiraiya Sensei? That is my question to you!
Answer me! You give each warring nation
a Forbidden Jutsu weapon. Once they possess such a power,
they are bound to use it. What do you mean? Tens of millions will die instantly... and people will become scared. People...and nations will learn
what pain is! That fear will breed a strong aversion
to war and the fighting will end. It can be said that this world
is still in the process of growing and stabilizing. Pain will make the world mature. In the same way that I matured. In order for the world to grow up
and become wiser a god's hand is necessary. The world is still a child. Teach the world pain in order to
make it grow up... Do you believe that is your work? Yes...because I am the god of peace. You've gotten good
at telling jokes...Nagato. Joke? I'm not joking. My ideal is... Over here, Sensei. Is that you're next summoning? To me, you are a small existence
which never matured. Summoning Jutsu! A kid treating me like a kid! Well, I'm no longer human either! These tears of blood,
overflowing with rage! I went from the Sannin to Sage!
The Monstrous Toad of Mount Myoboku! I am Master Jiraiya...! You haven't matured at all...
You're just as clumsy as before. Hey! Mister Gamaken!
Don't jostle around during my juncture! I'm kind of clumsy... Hmph! Gotta hand it
to my former student!

 He knows my moves all too well.

 I don't know what happened
in the past.

 But now he's powerful enough
to head the Akatsuki.

 Plus he wields the legendary Rinnegan.

 Against this foe,
there shall be no playing by ear!

 I must go full power with
my Sage Mode!

 Next time: "Honored Sage Mode!"

 Look forward to my awesome action!

 Master Jiraiya, when is the new
Make-Out Series coming out? I've read mine over ten times already. You still young, aren't you? Surely, there are more
important things in life? What? Is Naruto in trouble again? No, just the opposite. But his power has exceeded
all my expectations. The passing of the torch
is just a matter of time. When it comes to fighting, he learns fast.
That's for sure... Huh? You really turn me on! Get lost, you old pervert! I'm not giving up! That's my Ninja Way! Master Jiraiya... There's nothing like
making out in life! Summoning Jutsu! I'm going to do some research
for my Make-Out Series! Take care of the rest! G-Good luck. Tune in again!

 Against this foe,
there shall be no playing by ear! I'm coming at you with full force! I'm using the Honored Sage Mode! What?! You don't mean...?! Yes indeed. I'm summoning the two great sages! However, it's going to take some time
to summon the two of them. And I cannot release my hands
during that time. I'm counting on you.
Buy me some time until then! All right. Clumsy as I am, I shall try. He vanished. What a bother... Where in the world did he find
such a creature? Now that he's made himself invisible,
we've got to use Barrier Battle Arts. Hmm... He's a hard one to battle. As I recall... This is a barrier ninjutsu that senses and
alerts any intrusion across its boundary. In that case... He saw the barrier and switched
to a strong offensive critter! Mister Gamaken! Right! Clumsy as I am, here we go! You're quite skilled! Not at all... I am clumsy. What?! Wh-What is this?! Are you okay, Mister Gamaken? You think you could do this
a bit smoother? But I am clumsy... They seem to multiply each time
you clobber them... I don't even have a clue what it is... Are the doggies bound to
a self-replicating summoning jutsu?! In any case,
we'd better move from this spot. We'll kill one dog at a time!
Let's lure them into a small space. Right! So that's the center of the jutsu... Were we able to lose it...? That should buy us some time. Or not! We're surrounded already! Incoming! And they're going
to split up again! Above you! There's no end to this. I am  trying my best... If they keep dividing,
no matter how hard we strike them, it's a waste of our energy. Here already?
Damn persistent dogs! Stupid little...! Are you all right?! Mister Gamaken! I really am... clumsy... If you can't move, Mister Gamaken... then there's no time to summon
the two great sages. I give up. But I'm amazed
there're so many of them... But against the Great Toad
of Mount Myoboku, you're all nothing but a small snack! Honored Sage Mode!

 Gone... Along with the dogs. So he's escaped for now. I haven't escaped! Nagato, you're still a novice. Leaving your back open for an attack! You're a Shadow Clone too?! Yes, but that's not all. At the same time... Summoning Jutsu! Damn it! It's no good... Mister Gamaken! What? Whoa... Yes! You're relieved from duty! I did it! Huh? It's one thing after another... But I'm almost there. So I can't quit now, but... Incoming! Wha--?! So fast!! Sorry I'm late. Good work! I want to attack the caster,
but I need to be able to see him! Don't you think something
is strange, Mister Gamaken? I-I am... too clumsy to understand
what you mean. He who possessed the same pupils
as the Sage of the Six Paths, not only mastered every jutsu
I taught him... he demonstrated the ability to achieve
all six changes in Chakra Nature. For a single person to do so
is unheard of. He was well versed in
all the mainstream ninjutsu... and mastered them by the time
he was ten years old. But why...? Why is he only using
the Summoning Jutsu against me?! Does he think I am beneath
the need for direct confrontation? Mister Gamaken! You've done enough!
I've got it from here, go home! All right. Thanks. Lad! Why do you always summon us
in such touchy situations like this?! It's no wonder Bunta gets so mad! Aw c'mon, Ma.
Naturally, Jiraiya-boy has his reasons. You be quiet, Pa! It's been a while, and I do apologize for calling you
under these circumstances, Boss, Ma'am. But lad... I thought you said
you hated that form, saying it would make you unpopular
with the ladies! I can't afford to be particular right now. After all, my foe has the Rinnegan. Ah...the Pupils of Six Paths?! Someone actually possesses
such an eye? Well then, you had no choice. You gotta start being able to go into
Sage Mode by yourself, Jiraiya-boy. Compared to you,
I'm still just a novice. So please lend me your aid
for just a little while... Shall we begin? He went through all that just
to summon those two toads...? No, there is a transformation going on
in Sensei himself. Humph, whether it's Orochimaru or Jiraiya,
the Sannin each have unique powers. And? Where is the one with
the Pupils of Six Paths? Your eyes must be degrading with age. No. He's hidden himself inside
a summoning creature that can make itself invisible. It's gotta be one of them
chameleon species. I have erected a probe barrier. That won't do any good! Let's drag them out using
creature detection jutsu! Ma, don't get so excited,
you'll get more wrinkles. Just hush up, Pa! But why go so far as to summon us
to fight this fellow, Jiraiya-boy? He happens to be
a former student of mine... We never knew you had one!
Then is he...? Yes... As summoned. Ah, good. I'm glad you've come! Jiraiya-boy. The Great Lord Elder had
a dream about you. As you are aware, it is a prophecy. So listen carefully. Yes, sir! I shall now tell you. In my dream... You, who are solely pervy, will still
manage to become a splendid ninja. And in time, you will have
your own disciple... That disciple will become a ninja who will bring about a great change
to the ninja world. That is what I saw in my dream. A great change? Either great stability or great destruction. The likes of which this world
has never seen before. One of those two. The child of the prophecy?! Then why are you fighting him? It seems he did not grow up
in the right direction. And when I heard he had died... I thought he couldn't have been
the one. In any case, if he is not righteous,
you must kill him. Well, that senile old man probably
made up that prophecy. Don't worry about it! All right let's do it! Found him! It's fast! Gotcha! There we go! Pa! I'm on it! That's the Rinnegan? It certainly looks like the one mentioned
in the legend. What nasty eyes...
I can't believe he's that child of prophecy. You will guide that revolutionary. The day will come when you will be forced
to make a critical selection. Selection? Your choice shall decide which way
the change goes. Great Lord Elder...  I wonder if this is
that moment of selection? Summoning Jutsu. This time he's summoned humans. You turned out to be
a harbinger of destruction... So as your mentor,
it is my duty to take you down! Those three...

 They may look different,
but they all have the same eyes.

 Even if Nagato is one of the three,

 I can't believe there'd be that
many Rinnegan running about.

 So what in the world's going on?!

 There must be
some explanation for this.

 Who and what is Pain?!

 Next time:
"In Attendance, the Six Paths of
Pain"

 Pay close attention to my battle!

 Tune in again!

 Three of them? What's going on? How could there be three Rinnegans...? It must be his jutsu...
There's some trick to it. Just when I was busy preparing dinner... Ma, never mind that.
Just focus on the opponent before us! What did you say?! I guess it's about time
I made my move! From this moment on,
let Sage Jutsu prevail! Look above, upon the halos
and heavenly canopies! Jiraiya the gallant-- - Quit yakking in my ears!
- Quit yakking in my ears! Ugh! Uh... My posturing keeps getting
interrupted today... Let's end this quickly and go home! I have to get dinner ready! Ma, that guy's eye is
more important than dinner! Stay alert!
It's the ultimate ocular jutsu! Like I care! Don't you dare belittle
a housewife's dilemma of what to cook every day,
you old geezer! How dare you use such a tone
against me! I was just looking after you! Don't give me that! Who are the ones yakking into
whose ears again? Not bad... Now then... Can we put
your spousal differences aside and get this here over with? Humph... Guess I'll just fry up something. Boy, you provide the oil.
Pa, you bring the Wind Style! Yes ma'am! Sage Art: Bath of Boiling Oil! Did it work? The oil vanished? They ought to have been basted by it. That one probably has tricks
up his sleeve too. Shall we find out with close combat? Yes. Massive Rasengan! He's...! He can absorb an entire jutsu?! So that's what he did earlier... Behind us! We got his back! What?! He blocked my Sage Mode attack
without looking?! Sage Art: Kebari Senbon! Not a single wasted movement. I would've gotten him if he'd dodged it... Instead he blocked it by summoning
without ever turning around. What's going on? Blocking my attacks not just once,
but twice! With no verbal signals or eye contact
between them at all... Even if all three were sensory types, they still have to see an attack
coming in order to counter it. Kebari Senbon is my fastest jutsu
with the widest attack range. The only way to defend oneself
against it is with a shield, as he just did. And he did it without looking. They're no ordinary clones. You said they have a trick up
their sleeves, and you're right. Hmm? Have you noticed? What is it? When we got their back earlier, you picked the target and attacked
from his blind spot, correct? During that time, one of the other guys
was watching us the whole time. I noticed that too. But there were no signs that they were signaling each other
either verbally or with eye contact. That's it! It's their eyes...
All three have the same eyes! Suppose the three of them can
share what they see with each other... Enabling their eyes to share images
with one another... Is that it? Yes. That's what I suspect... Still... What in tarnation are they? This is bad... Under these circumstances
where my ninjutsu are being nullified... To face all three at once
is a bit too much. At this rate, if I enter battle... I'll be killed,
even in Sage Mode. I never imagined
they would be this strong... Fall back for now, Jiraiya-boy. Yes sir. He's escaped into the pipes... In Attendance,
The Six Paths of Pain

 Why are we running away? We must analyze the Six Paths
and come up with a strategy. And we'll need some time for that. They may look different,
but all possessed the same eye. In short, they all have
the Rinnegan of Six Paths... Even if one of them is Nagato, I can't believe there would be
so many Rinnegan users crawling around. So what in the world's going on?! Which one is the real Pain? Figuring out the main one
isn't the problem. The real problem is the fact that three of them possess
the Rinnegan of Six Paths. Just who...and what is Pain? We don't know that yet.
But we can make a small deduction. Their vision is linked,
and they share images. That's the ability those eyes hold. Which means what, then?
And how is it an advantage? Put simply... In the same way that three
security cameras show different angles
of the same image, those three are able to see
three views at one time. So if just one of them
can see the target... the other two can counter with
the ideal attack, with perfect timing without having
to see their foe. In other words, their field of vision
is three times better. And unlike the Byakugan, they can always guard
each other's blind spots without weaving signs or
manipulating chakra. No wonder their combination
is invincible. Which means we have to split them up
and fight each one separately. I'm positive I can win one-on-one... Since they possess such eyes, fighting as a team would have to
be their basic mode of attack. Taijutsu isn't going to work... and any ninjutsu will just be absorbed. If taijutsu and ninjutsu won't work,
then it'll have to be genjutsu. Yes! But I am a dud
when it comes to genjutsu. Ah, but as I recall you two were... Yes... If they're former students
of yours, Jiraiya-boy, they know that you don't use genjutsu. So that might give us an opening. No way! I'm not gonna do it! Wh-What is it?! World peace is hanging
on this battle, Ma! This is no time to be selfish! I don't care about no old geezer's
senile prophecies! The Great Lord Elder told us to
get along, remember?! What is it that you
object to so much? I can't sing a duet with Pa
at this plump ripe old age! It's embarrassing! Huh? A duet?! Our most powerful genjutsu
involves appealing to the auditory senses of
the victim through song. Auditory senses? I see.
That's why we retreated. Correct...This genjutsu is powerful,
but as soon as we make a sound, our whereabouts will be revealed,
which is its weakness. Also, there's the harmony
of the sounds... In other words, the genjutsu
is placed with a melody. It requires a little time
before it takes effect. If they discover our whereabouts before they are caught in the genjutsu
and attack, we will surely lose. However, once they are caught
in the genjutsu, our victory will be assured. What's wrong? If both your lives are ever in danger, I want you to free yourselves
from my shoulders immediately. Huh? Absolutely not! The fate of the ninja world depends
on this battle! I have a plan.
Although it is a gamble as well... Do tell. Please begin... - Right.
- Right. What is that? This is...the croaking of frogs... Is this a genjutsu?! It's coming from in there. A Shadow Clone! Fire Style: Giant Flame Bombs! So that's your move! Good! My gamble's a success! That big one went after
 the jutsu to absorb it! The first fellow only used summoning... While both times, it was the big fellow
who absorbed my jutsu. Just as I suspected, each of them possesses
only a single type of ability! Right now, the big fellow's eyes
are focused on the jutsu. One, I blinded earlier... So only one of them... is looking at me! This one too! Gotcha! I can't move. The dark swamp?! Just a little more! Now we're really one-on-one! I'm not letting you summon! You got us... You are inside a genjutsu paralysis
that binds your psyche. Now none of your bodies, including your main body,
will be able to move. Jiraiya Sensei... I didn't expect
a genjutsu like this from you. I thought I taught you... Never let your guard down, no matter
who your opponent is, Nagato... You erred in your decision. I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. I see. Rather than rule the world
through pain... I wish you had moved past the pain and harnessed your power to bring
about peace in a positive way. That disciple will become a ninja who will bring about
 a great change to the ninja world. That is what I saw in my dream. Either great stability
or great destruction. The likes of which this world
has never seen before. One of those two. For just a little while...
I believed you were the one. Farewell... It's done... Are you both all right?! This genjutsu is hard on the throat. It's real hard keeping tempo with Pa...
This jutsu ain't that easy at all! Damages the throat!
Stretches the lower jaw 'til it sags! Creates wrinkles! My profound apologies.
Please take your rest now. For I've made my selection. Didn't you teach me to never
let down your guard...Jiraiya Sensei? Lad! Your left arm! I'm aware of that... What's going on?! This one's got a different face
than the other three... He was probably summoned earlier. I see! Before they got caught
in our genjutsu! Now then. In attendance...
The Six Paths of Pain. Six?! There are six of them?! Hey, look close!
The three we just did in are there too! The newly summoned ones
must have resurrected them with some sort of jutsu! There's even a jutsu that can revive
as many as three of them when they were undoubtedly dead?! Are they really human?! Pain... What are you?! Pain... That name is an alias that
denotes all six of us. Why... are there six Rinnegan bearers? Y-You're...! Never going back on your word
and never giving up...

 Naruto, if that is your ninja way,

 then as your mentor,
I have no business whining.

 For everyone knows

 that a student inherits his ninja way
from his teacher...!

 Next time, on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"

 Tune in again next time, won't you?

 It's Naruto Uzumaki's Swirling Radio!
Today's guest is... To all my female supporters throughout
the nation, Jiraiya has arr-- And now, let's get right to our first letter... Hey! Let me finish my intro! From radio alias "Pervy Hedgehog." "When will the next
'Make-Out Series' be published?" W-Well, I have an outline completed... Okay, next! From radio alias,
"Akemi from the Fun Fun Alley." "When will you pay your tab?" Hey brat! How could you read
that on the air?! Couldn't you have asked me backstage...? And so, we have Akemi
at the studio today! What?! I-Is there somewhere
I can hide? Just kidding. Huh? I-I knew that. Well, come on.
Let's move on with the show. Geez... And you were so cool
in the main story. Minato... Did I raise your son
the wrong way?


 Tune in again!

 The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

 There's no end to this awful rain... Joking! I'm just joking! You know, I'm grateful to you. I'm sure Master Jiraiya is fine. He, of all people, wouldn't... He's not coming back... Huh? That's what I bet him. And I never win my bets. Oh, I see. Rejection makes a man stronger. And besides... men aren't the ones
who seek happiness. What a poser... When he gets back... I won't let him keep his cool. Pain... What are you?! Pain... That name is an alias that
denotes all six of us. Y-You're...! That face... Is that you, Yahiko? Oh yeah... There was such a guy,
wasn't there? He died a long time ago. What's going on?
I thought you said Yahiko died! Plus, those eyes... You see Yahiko's image in me? You really are his former Teacher. But Yahiko has been dead
for quite some time. All that remains...is Pain. Quit it with the wordplay! Why do you possess the Rinnegan?! What are you talking about,
Jiraiya-boy? One of my former students
is among them. Except he didn't use to
possess those eyes... What in tarnation is going on? You saying there are
two children of prophecy? No, that's not it either... When I saw the Rinnegan, I convinced
myself that the first one was Nagato... But he's subtly different
from the Nagato I knew of... Come to think of it,
upon closer inspection, none of those six remind me of Nagato. On the other hand,
one of them resembles Yahiko... but possesses Nagato's Rinnegan... Are you Yahiko...or Nagato? Just what exactly are you?! We are Pain... We are god. Retreat, Jiraiya-boy! A god?! Yahiko! How could you possess
Nagato's eyes?! Even if you knew that,
you could not win! Lad! Give up already! I must find an opening to defeat them,
even if it kills me! I don't sense his presence... This is...a barrier? Gastric fluid? Rasengan! You did it, Jiraiya-boy. Is he dead? I barely managed to kill one... only after dragging it into my barrier... Are you all right, lad? Somewhat... My body...?! My chakra's agitated! Is it this?! Their identity is a mystery,
and they seem to use odd weapons too. They're no longer mortals...
They're something entirely different. No one really knows what
he looks like. And some claim that
he doesn't even exist. That face...
He is unmistakably Yahiko... And yet,
he possesses Nagato's Rinnegan... Did Yahiko steal them
from Nagato for some reason? But... There are other
Rinnegan bearers as well... So what's going on? Plus... Understanding such pain enables you
to be kind to others... That's what makes us human. What do you mean by that...? It's called growing up. Growing up? What do you mean? That, you need to figure out yourself. Too many people die here.
That pain made me grow up. In which case,
does that mean he is Nagato? That's right! Now I remember! This one is definitely not Nagato! What's the matter? This fellow before us... I've fought him before. He was a Fuma Clan member
I encountered right after setting out on my journey,
following the Great Lord Elder's prophecy. I gave him that scar on his forehead... So what's a fellow like him
doing here? Now I'm even more confused
about this whole Pain mystery. You will guide that revolutionary. The day will come when you will be
forced to make a critical selection. What must I do...? In order to make the right choice? In my dream, you traveled the world,
writing books. It can't be...
If this is the prophecy... I wish to go back and face them
in order to confirm something... You two please go back. What?! Absolutely not! You will be killed
if you go out again! They have more eyes, and they will not fall
for the barrier trap twice! They're not on to us in here yet. This is our only chance to
make a run for it! I may be killed if I go out there... But I may be able to learn
the truth about them. If I let this chance slip by, I don't think there's anyone else
who could get as close to Pain. This is our only chance to
uncover the truth... Plus... This is the time for selection
that the Great Lord Elder prophesied! Boss and Ma'am... please take the intel on Pain
we've gathered so far, as well as this corpse and go back. And please tell Tsunade... Ma should be enough for that. But... Just return by dinnertime. Yup... When we're done here,
I'll bring Jiraiya-boy on over with me. Thank you... It's just as I thought! They're all ninjas that
I've encountered before! That's it! I've figured out who Pain is! My throat... Jiraiya-boy! You were too late in figuring it out... I must let Boss know...about
Pain's true identity. Hang in there, Jiraiya-boy! It's no good...
My throat has been crushed. Damn it... At this rate... It's useless... I'm passing out... Am I...going to die? Have I failed...? It's not how you live, but how you die in
the ninja world... A ninja's life is not measured
by how they lived but rather what they managed
to accomplish before their death. Looking back, my life has
been nothing but failures... Continually rejected by Tsunade... Unable to stop my friend... And unable to protect either
my student or my mentor... Compared to the great deeds
of the Hokage, my actions are trifling,
insignificant things indeed. I wish I could have died like
each of the Hokage. A tale is only good as
its final turn of events, the plot twist. Failures must be seen
as mere amusements! They are trials, which hone your skills.
I lived believing that... And in return, I swore I would
accomplish a deed so great that it would obliterate all
of my failures... And I'd die a splendid ninja! At least, that's how it
was supposed to go... But...with my plot twist... My tale, ending like this... The Great Lord Elder prophesied that
I would guide that revolutionary. A person who will make
a great choice that will bring either stability
or destruction to the ninja world. I thought I would defeat Pain,
stop the Akatsuki, and save the ninja world
from destruction... But in the end, I failed in
that selection too. How pitiful... that this will be the twist to
"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant." What a worthless story... No, I don't think so.
This tale is wonderful! Each chapter reads like one of
your numerous legendary exploits. It's almost like an autobiography. The main character of this book... I thought his determination to
never give up was really cool... He's a lot like you, Sensei. Y-You think so...? So I was thinking. Huh? I really hope my unborn child can become a ninja just
like this main character! Which is why I'd like your permission
to name my son after him. H-Hey! Are you sure? It's just a random name that
I thought up while eating ramen. Naruto... It's a wonderful name. Kushina... Cripes...
So that makes me his godfather? Are you really sure about this? You are my sensei! And you are a great ninja who possesses
the true talent of a ninja! There's no other like you. Yes... That's right... I gave that child... I'm gonna become the Hokage! A Hokage that surpasses
all previous Hokage! I never go back on my word...
That's my ninja way! Naruto... Now that I think about it, Naruto, you are just like that
novel's main character. You've inherited Minato and
Kushina's wishes, their hopes... And yet...I... You are my sensei! And you are a great ninja who
possesses the true talent of a ninja! There's no other like you. A ninja is one who endures,
one who stands brave. Let me teach you one thing... The most important attribute
of a ninja is not the number of jutsu he masters. The most important thing is... the guts to never give up! Never go back on your word
and never give up... Naruto, if that is your ninja way... Then as your mentor... I have no business whining. For everyone knows that a student
inherits his ninja way from his teacher! Isn't that so, Naruto?! He fought his way back by sheer will?! Jiraiya-boy! I was sure his heart had stopped. Got it! Never give up... That was the true choice
I was supposed to make! Quite obstinate, isn't he? Let's finish him off. All right! Message received! A dying message...
He wrote it in code, eh? Naruto... You are the child of prophecy,
I'm sure of it now. I entrust you with the rest! The frog...got away. "The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"... Now it'll end a bit better I hope. The final chapter will be... "The Frog in the Well Drifts
Into the Great Ocean." Not bad... Not bad at all... Now... It's about time
I put down my pen... Ah, that's right!
What should I name the sequel? Let's see... "The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki." Yes... That has a nice ring to it... Itachi Uchiha...
You haven't changed, have you?

 But I'm no longer the same as before.

 You don't know anything about me...

 Of the hatred I carry towards you...

 And how it helped me
become stronger...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Banquet Invitation"

 Don't miss it!

 One of the legendary Sannin...
Jiraiya is no more... If we didn't have this secret,
we could not have won. Let us praise him as our teacher. By the way...
you can come out. Sure took you a while. His opponent was Jiraiya,
after all. That was some interference we got. I'm under orders from Madara
to capture the Nine-Tails. Well then... I'd love to see
the Nine-Tails captured, so let's go together. No! I'm going to watch another battle. - What?
- Shut up! Which battle is that? The battle between... I wonder if Sasuke is okay... What do you mean? What if the first Akatsuki hideout
is a bull's-eye? Are you saying Itachi is
inside this hideout? I said, "what if?" This Itachi is supposed to
be really strong, right? There's no way that Sasuke
could lose to... Maybe we should be thinking about
a worst-case scenario. Sasuke... I'm going to check out
the inside from here. If anything happens, we're going in! Huh? Why're you taking over
all of a sudden? When it comes to Sasuke,
you go overboard. Th-That's not true...! I'm not going... You idiot! Then I'll ask the birds to
scour the area and look out for
the enemy's approach. Geez... Both of you... They're so diligent. This one's a fake too... I'm chasing after Sasuke's scent, yet... It seems the enemy is
one step ahead of us. That's why we're compensating
for their diversions with numbers! We've checked this side thoroughly. We should report this to the original. What's wrong, Naruto? The south forest only had dummies. I see. Why so depressed?! You never give up.
Isn't that your ninja way?! He's right, Naruto! All right! I'll use the chakra I've restored
to increase the Shadow Clones. I'm counting on you all! - Leave it to us!
- Leave it to us! So you've come... Who's there?! It's me...Sasuke. You've grown a bit taller. And you're still the same.
Even those cold eyes... Not going to scream and attack
like you did before? It's just as you said... I've hated you...and resented you... for the singular purpose
of killing you, I... I... have lived my life! Chidori? I will kill you! Die! You don't know a thing about me... How much hatred I carry inside me... And how strong I have become
because of that hatred. You don't know me at all. You've become...strong. Come to the Uchiha hideout alone. I'll let you settle things there. Sasuke! I told you not to move until
you received orders. Karin said she sensed another chakra,
so we were worried. Feathers? Follow me. Let's go! Banquet Invitation

 He's coming along nicely. Now... Will you still emerge as a snake?
Or will you transform into a hawk? We shall see, Sasuke... The same chakra is all over the place! What's going on?! Should we change course, Sasuke? Ignore it. We'll forge straight ahead. Good. Taking the long way
would've been tiring. Sasuke! What was that?! A Shadow Clone. Naruto, eh? What a pest. Multi-Shadow Clones... I get it now... The same chakra I sense all over
the place belongs to him. Found him! Good job! Which way?! This way! I'm not letting you get away
this time, Sasuke! What is this?! A humongous chakra!
And it's fast! In coming!! You're...! Only Sasuke may go beyond this point. It's Itachi's orders. The rest of you are welcome
to wait here. All right. Besides, we were only
traveling as a platoon in order to prevent interference
for my showdown... This will do. No, you can't, Sasuke! Let's take him down and
go in together! I have no intention of fighting. But if you insist on going with him,
I will show no mercy. Karin... Stay put.
This is my  vendetta. Kisame Hoshigaki...
And the Great Shark Skin Sword... Hmm? Have you forgotten me? I'm Suigetsu Hozuki,
the younger bother of Mangetsu Hozuki. Oh... I didn't recognize you!
You've grown, Suigetsu. I don't want to just wait around
for Sasuke... Will you let me kill some time and have some fun with you,
Kisame Senpai?! Unlike your brother,
you're quite cocky, aren't you? Maybe I should grind you down a bit. Suigetsu... Shouldn't we abide
by Sasuke's orders? Don't be stupid! You blockhead! This way, guys! Wait! Naruto... This chakra... Howdy! What the-?! Well now... How's it going there,
there, and there? Imagine running into the Hidden Leaf
in a place like this... I mean... It's two, four, six... Eight against one. Such bad timing. That robe...
You're a member of the Akatsuki! Though he wasn't on the list
that Kabuto left us. Oh, I'm a newbie. Nice to meet you. Hah! Think you're funny?!
Don't waste our time! Don't be rash. Study the situation first. Right now, we have him outnumbered. Oh dear...
Am I being underestimated? By you guys? So this is an Akatsuki member... Another weirdo... They keep getting between us and
Sasuke over and over again! Don't get in our way! A Shadow Clone?! Just kidding... It seems you're more proficient
with the blade than that kid. Kid?! You mean, Zabuza Senpai? My Great Shark Skin Sword was
never intended for dueling, you know! Same here. This one's... for killing! Tsk! Have fun? As if!
They're dead serious! Hey! Jugo... Tell him... It's okay... The birds are telling me there's no one nearby who will interfere
with their fighting. Geez... What if something happens
to Sasuke while these idiots are going at it? Even the Hidden Leaf are in pursuit! The Hidden Leaf have stopped? You're so full of yourself! Just what can a kid like you do?! Naruto... Thank goodness... Hinata! Naruto can handle the damage! Don't take your eyes off the enemy! Hmm? Are you guys analyzing
my strength right now? The Hidden Leaf are very shrewd... But for a newbie, I'm pretty good...
don't you think? He's dodged every one
of Naruto's attacks. He's toying with us.
But what is he after? Tsk! He has a tad more power
in wielding the blade. Well then...! Such a monotone effort. I take back what I said about you
being better than Zabuza. Eat this! Almost got you there, didn't I? What are you so excited about?
Is it your snack time? What?! My chakra...
But I didn't use up that much yet! My Shark Skin Sword grinds
and absorbs chakra. I thought you would be more observant. Care for another taste? Why you...! Now then... What shall we play,
Hidden Leaf folks? We don't have time to waste
on the likes of you! He's right! That's because we have to go
after Sasuke. Shino, you didn't get to go on
the last mission to retrieve Sasuke! We're counting on you this time! Our bond, is it? All right...everyone.
Let's end this quickly. We'll go with Formation B, everyone. Roger! - Right!
- Yes sir! Ohh? Seems you're serious.
Well, I'd better get fired up. You jerk... Quit kidding around! Naruto, concentrate on the formation! Yeah, I know. Let's do it.
Kiba, are you ready on your side? Anytime. Right, Akamaru?! Then here goes! Oh my, so high...
That girl has such brute power. Oops! They distracted me with the decoy...
And now those three are surrounding me! I don't know which one to dodge! S-Say, that's no fair! - No time for you to look!
- Oh dear... What...? Cha! Cha! Olé! Three against one?!
You Hidden Leaf cowards! Rasengan! You weren't the decoy? You got me...! Not! Ninja Art! Blockade Jutsu! Cripes... You said you were going
to do it all together... And I believed you! Don't stop, everyone! Separate and force your way through! Oh dear! N-Ninja Art...
Umm... Geez! What kind of jutsu is that? I got it! I'm going to name this jutsu... Ninja Art: Whack-A-Mole Jutsu! Except the roles for hitting are reversed... Senpai... I know... Unless we finish him off for good,
he won't let us move forward. Damn it! Say say... What shall we play next? We can't be wasting time
in a place like this! I know that.
We'll go with Battle Formation A next. Just a bit longer...
You just wait, Itachi! My foolish little brother...

 So you've finally arrived before me.

 It seems you've been waiting
for this moment...

 But the same goes for me.

 Come...!

 Recreate my death as you've seen it.
  
 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Longest Moment..."

 How far do you see ahead?

 COMMEMORATING
THE 350TH EPISODE
W-Welcome to the party. It will begin shortly,
so please come this way. In commemoration of passing
the 350th episode... Hold it! What are...you doing?! Why didn't you guys invite me,
the main character?! Well, you weren't in Episode 350. Th-That was just by coincidence... Huh? Really? You weren't in Episode 100
or Episode 300 either. Shut up! I don't want to be told
by a newcomer like you who started from Episode 252! For a main character, you don't seem to have much luck
with milestone episodes. Maybe you're not so popular? I don't want to be told by you! But having no lines in
a milestone episode is pretty sad for a main character. Not you too, Sakura... So here's a toast! Cheers! - Cheers! Congratulations!
- Damn it! N-Naruto... Ch-Cheer up! You're not helping me here... Tune in again!

 My foolish little brother... Wow, Brother! You nailed every target, even the one
in the blind spot behind the rock! All right, my turn! Sasuke. It's time to go. You said that you would teach me
a new shuriken jutsu. I have an important mission tomorrow
that I must prepare for. You're a liar... Sorry, Sasuke. - Maybe some other time.
- Ow! Big Brother, watch this! Hey! Don't be reckless... The Longest Moment...

 How come the one who twisted his ankle
is the one laughing? Was it on purpose
so I'd carry you? No. I'm just happy 'cuz tomorrow
I'll be starting the academy too. Maybe now,
I can catch up to you a little. Itachi... Have you made up your mind? If not, then we will act instead-- No, please wait. It will be too late
once things start to move... The situation is dire! I realize that... I shall settle this with my own hands. What?! Do you know
what day tomorrow is?! You don't understand
your own position! I'm setting out on a mission tomorrow. What kind of mission? I can't tell you...
It's a top-secret mission. Itachi... You also serve
as the Uchiha clan's pipeline to the Village nerve center. You know that, don't you? Yes... Keep that well in mind. And come to tomorrow's assembly! Father only cares about you,
Big Brother... You probably hate me, huh? It's all right... It's a fact that ninja
go through life being hated. That's not how I feel... Being the best isn't all
it's cracked up to be... If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant. Even if you're coveted and
sought after at first. But, we only have each other
as siblings. I'm always going to be there for you, even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me... That's what big brothers are for. Is Itachi here?! We need to talk. Come out! What brings you all here? There were two people who didn't show up
at yesterday's assembly. Why didn't you come? We understand that joining
the Anbu Black Ops means being pushed to do all sorts
of petty assignments. Your father has said as much
and tries to defend you. But we have no intention of
giving you special treatment. I understand.
I shall be more careful hereafter. Now, I'm going to have to
ask you to leave. All right. But before that, we'd like to ask you
a bit more about something. It's about Shisui Uchiha who died after throwing himself into
the Nakano River last night. As I recall, you looked up to him like
an older brother, didn't you? I see... I hadn't seen him recently... That's too bad. And we, the Police Force, have decided
to launch an all-out investigation. Investigation?! This is the will Shisui left. The handwriting analysis shows
that it is unmistakably his. If there are no signs of foul play,
why investigate at all? Someone who uses Sharingan would
be able to make a perfect copy. I HAVE WEARIED OF DUTY. AS IT IS,
THE UCHIHA HAS NO FUTURE.
NEITHER DO I... I CAN NO LONGER
FOLLOW THE "PATH."







The most talented of all our clan,
feared as Shisui the Teleporter... He was a man who took on any mission
for the sake of the clan. It's hard to believe that someone like that
would kill himself, leaving this behind. You shouldn't judge people
by their appearance, or by your own preconceptions. Anyway, we'll leave his will with you. Take it to the Anbu and request their cooperation
in the investigation! Understood... Let's hope we get a lead on this soon. Why don't you just come out
and say it? You all suspect me, right? Yeah, that's right.
You little punk! Like I said earlier, appearances and preconception
aren't going to tell you anything. You assume that I'm very patient
and underestimate me... The clan...the clan... You keep harping on it, mistaking the size of that vessel
and underestimating the size of mine. That's why you're here now, groveling. Shisui had been monitoring you lately. It's been six months since
you joined the Anbu, but your recent words and actions
have been intolerable. Just what are you thinking? This attachment to the organization,
to the clan, to one's name... Such attachments put a limit on
one's vessel and should be shunned. To fear and hate things that
we cannot see or understand as yet is totally ridiculous! Stop! Itachi! That's enough...
What is going on with you? Itachi...
You haven't been yourself lately. I'm perfectly sane. I'm carrying out my duties.
That's all I'm doing. Then why didn't you come last night? In order to elevate myself higher... What are you talking about? My vessel is dismayed at
this foolish clan! Adhering to this clan...
and petty things... makes you lose sight of
what's truly important. Real change won't come about when
you're bound by regulations and limitation... when you're satisfied with
premonition and guesses. Such arrogance! Enough. Say another word and
we'll throw you in prison! So, what will you do?! I've had enough!
Captain, give us the order to arrest him! Big Brother! Please stop! I did not kill Shisui... But I apologize for the words
I have spoken... I'm truly sorry. You've been working too hard on
your Anbu Black Ops missions, and I think you're a little tired. But Captain! The Anbu Black Ops is under
the direct orders of the Hokage. Without an arrest warrant,
we cannot detain him. I will take full responsibility over Itachi
and keep an eye on him. You have my word. Very well, sir. Let's go inside, Itachi. Itachi... I'll leave your meal here. I know you're busy with work,
but do join us for meals once in a while. Thank you... Mother. I stayed back to practice
throwing shuriken and now I'm totally late. I had a feeling
there was someone there... What is this?! Father! Mother! Big Brother!
Father and Mother are...! Why? What happened?! Who would do such a thing?! Foolish little brother... Mangekyo Sharingan! He's worthy of being my son. Your father only talks about you. Stop it, Big Brother!
Why are you showing me all of this?! Why...? Why did you do this? To measure my abilities... Measure your abilities?
That's all? Just for that...
you...killed everyone? It is of great importance. It's a lie!
This isn't like you, Big Brother... It can't be...! I acted like the older brother
you desired... in order to measure your vessel. You will become a rival to measure
my vessel against... You have that hidden potential. You've been jealous of me
and resented me. You've harbored hopes
of surpassing me. That is why I am allowing you to live.
For my sake... Like me, you will awaken the powers
of the Mangekyo Sharingan. However, on one condition... You must kill...your closest friend! As I did... Then...you... You killed Shisui? As a result, I possess this "eye." In the main hall in Nakano Shrine beneath the seventh tatami mat from
the inner right side is the clan's hidden meeting room. There you will find the record of
the Uchiha Clan's Visual Jutsu and its true purpose. If you awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan, there will be three, including myself,
who possess its powers. Then... there will be meaning
in letting you live. There is no value in killing you now... my foolish little brother. If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me, and survive...in obscurity. Run...keep running... and cling to life. Then one day, come before me
with the same eye that I possess. That Sharingan...
How much can you actually see? How much can I see with these? What I'm seeing right now, Itachi... is your death. My death, huh? Well then... make it happen. Chidori! Chidori Stream! You've become...strong. Itachi... I have one last thing to ask... You've become...strong The same line as before...
and the bird... Another farce with
your special genjutsu? What do you want to know? It's not over, but I'll hear you out. I'll say it once more... Genjutsu... I have one last thing to ask... That's what I said, you bastard! Answer my question. That pain in your chest won't
subside until you answer. So you purposely missed a vital spot... You said back then... If you awaken
the Mangekyo Sharingan, there will be three, including myself,
who possess its powers. Then... there will be meaning
in letting you live. The third person...
The other one with a Sharingan... Who in the Uchiha Clan is it? Why...the curiosity about such a thing? I'm going to kill him after you.
That's why. Kill? When you killed off the entire clan, you mentioned the existence
of another person. So that Uchiha member you didn't kill
was a co-conspirator. Even you could not kill
the entire Police Force alone. So you figured it out... Who is it?! It's Madara Uchiha... With that vision and chakra
more ominous than my own... It's just like...Madara Uchiha,
from long ago... Heck if I know...that person. Madara...Uchiha?! One of the founders
of Hidden Leaf Village... The man who first possessed
the Mangekyo Sharingan. Madara Uchiha...

 The only man to uncover the other secret
of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

 If that's Madara,
the founder of the Hidden Leaf,
  
 he should be long dead.

 Who would believe such a story?

 Madara is alive...

 It's up to you whether you believe
that or not.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Light & Dark
of the Mangekyo Sharingan"

 Let me tell you a little about the past...

 Tune in again!

 The Light & Dark
of the Mangekyo Sharingan

 You've become...strong. The same line as before...
and the bird... Another farce with
your special genjutsu? What do you want to know? It's not over,
but I'll hear you out. I'll say it once more... When you killed off the entire clan, you mentioned the existence
of another person. So that Uchiha member you didn't kill
was a co-conspirator. Even you could not kill
the entire Police Force alone. So you figured it out... Who is it?! It's Madara Uchiha... With that vision and chakra
more ominous than my own... It's just like...Madara Uchiha,
from long ago... Heck if I know...that person. Madara...Uchiha?! One of the founders
of Hidden Leaf Village... The man who first possessed
the Mangekyo Sharingan. Founder? That Madara
should be long dead! Are you making fun of me?! Madara is alive... It's up to you whether you believe
that or not. Stop joking around! In order to survive, we cling to
all we know and understand. And we label it reality. But knowledge and understanding
are ambiguous. That reality could be an illusion. All humans live with
the wrong assumptions. Isn't that another way
of looking at it? Just what are you trying to say? It's only your assumption
that Madara is dead. In exactly the same way you once assumed that
I was your kind older brother. I just pretended to be the kind
of brother you wanted... in order to measure your vessel. What happened that night... I was so young and thought
it was all an illusion. That I was caught in
a cruel genjutsu... I wanted to believe that. But that was...unmistakably reality! My eye is not like it was
in the past! My Sharingan can see
through genjutsu! You still speak with such confidence. But for now, I'll take your word for it. Why don't we end this little charade? Being confident is fine. But Sasuke, your eye still isn't
the same as mine. Then one day, come before me with
the same eye that I possess. So...you couldn't kill the friend
who is most dear to you. And you dared to appear before me
with such weak resolve? Then hurry it up and try to kill me
with your Mangekyo Sharingan! Or is it too difficult to test
your capability against me now? You're pretty sure of yourself... Neither of them has moved
for a while. They're just feeling each other out
with genjutsu. Mangekyo Sharingan...
This eye is special... From the moment it awakens,
it goes towards the dark. And the more it is used,
the more it is sealed. What do you mean? In time, the Mangekyo Sharingan
loses its light. Blindness... Is that the trade-off for the power
to control the Nine-Tails? You did as I instructed and read the lithograph in
the meeting room? Madara... Exactly who and what is he? The first one ever to use that eye
to tame the Nine-Tails. An immortal man who is both
my partner and my mentor... And the only one to uncover
the other secret of the Mangekyo Sharingan. That...is Madara Uchiha. The other secret of
Mangekyo Sharingan? FOX It has another ocular power aside
from taming the Nine-Tails? Yes... One more secret.
The most important secret. Most important secret?
What is it? What is it?! Answer me! Let me tell you a little
about the past. It concerns the history
of the Uchiha. Long ago, Madara had a brother...
A younger brother. Madara Uchiha and
his younger brother... From the time they were little, they honed their skills and
competed with each other. The Mangekyo Sharingan awakened
in them both... and in time, they were considered
special by their clan. Both sought to sharpen
their ocular powers and competed against each other. And the brothers... They killed off those important to them and finally awakened
the Mangekyo Sharingan. It had never before been seen
among the Uchiha. The brothers used their
ocular powers to take control and Madara became the leader. However, a change began to
occur in Madara who had been physically fine. As I mentioned earlier,
this eye is special. The more you use it,
the more it is sealed... until you end up with total darkness. That is the ultimate fate of
the Mangekyo Sharingan. The price for gaining power is
destroying it yourself, losing its light. In order to regain his sight,
Madara tried every means possible... yet nothing worked. He was in despair. Madara became haunted by
the Mangekyo Sharingan and sought light. Forgive me... He took both eyes from
his younger brother. Madara now possessed new light. And...never again did the light fade
from his eyes. An eternal Mangekyo Sharingan! It is said that his younger brother's eyes
gained eternal light when it found a new host... And it triggered a change. A new, unique ocular jutsu was born
in those eyes. However, the exchange of eyes
can only be conducted among clan members. Furthermore, not everyone can attain
new powers from this method. That is the historical fact that remains
after countless were sacrificed. That is the other secret of this eye... Madara used his power and took control
of one ninja clan after another. Ultimately, he formed an alliance with
the Senju Clan of the Forest, which was touted as
the strongest ninja clan and established a new organization. Later, he clashed with the leader
of the Senju Clan, the future First Hokage,
over the course the village would take. He lost the battle over leadership, but Madara still lives with
his ocular powers intact. He formed a new organization
called the Akatsuki and hides himself in its shadows. Sixteen years ago, Madara instigated the Nine-Tails' attack
on Hidden Leaf Village. But that too was foiled by
the Fourth Hokage. In short... Madara is a bitter, defeated loser... He is not worthy of becoming
the best among the Uchiha. I am the one... who shall surpass Madara and
become the ultimate ninja! And now! I can finally obtain power
that exceeds Madara's! Sasuke! You are my new light! You have my spare eyes! Originally, the Uchiha Clan
killed off friends in order to possess
Mangekyo Sharingan. Parents and siblings killed each other off
to possess eternal ocular powers... And they showed off this power...
They are a tainted clan! And, from the day you were born, you have been inevitably linked
to this blood-sullied fate! Now come! My little brother! I shall kill you...
and free myself from this fate and bring about true change! I will be free of the constraints
that bind me! But, we only have each other
as siblings. I'm always going to be there for you, even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome. We are each other's spares! You've been jealous of me
and resented me. You've harbored hopes
of surpassing me. That is why I am allowing you to live. For my sake... This is the true bond between
the brothers of the Uchiha! It seems...you are finally seeing
what's inside my heart. So it was all for this... My name is Sasuke Uchiha. There are lots of things I hate.
And not many things I like. Also...I have no intention
of saying I have a dream. But I do have ambition! To restore my clan...and kill... a certain man. I've finally arrived... The moment to fulfill my goal! You say you can see my death... But you cannot win against
my Mangekyo Sharingan. Unfortunately, your goal will end
as an illusion. Because you do not possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan. You're still weak... You're weak,
because you don't have enough hate. You can use your eyes all you like, but my hate will turn
my illusion into reality! Your reality... is death! Even during our shoot out, he was able to weave signs
for a Shadow Clone! You ran it through with Chidori?! Forgive me, Sasuke... This is my reality... Give me your light. That ended quicker than I expected...

 Itachi's won.
Sasuke can no longer move...

 All that remains is for Itachi
to finish him off.

 Do you really think so?

 Of course.

 There's no way a Sharingan could win
against the Mangekyo Sharingan.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Amaterasu!" 

 Guess we can't take our eyes away
from this one.

 That's right. Naruto tosses around when he sleeps,
so I'd better move away. What?! Who's there?! Akamaru can dance just as well too... Now it's you... Tunneling Fang! He's half-asleep...but what power... I'm avenging Sakura! Uhh... This voice...isn't...? Sakura... You're a man, after all... Tunneling Fang! Rasengan! Cripes, talk about tossing and turning... I agree. Huh? Can you lie still and go to sleep?! No!


 Tune in again!

 Forgive me, Sasuke… This is my reality… Give me your light. I told you. You do not possess
the Mangekyo Sharingan. You can never win against
my eyes. I’ll take the other one too. So that is the power of
the Curse Mark… This is the difference in
our strength. And… the difference between
your ocular powers and mine. That was fast… Itachi’s won. How can you tell? Sasuke’s caught in the Tsukuyomi. He’s paralyzed. Itachi can do
whatever he wants now. Huh?! You broke through…my Tsukuyomi?! Huh? Sasuke took a Tsukuyomi,
so why isn’t he down? No… He didn’t fall for it. He broke out of the Tsukuyomi. What?! Someone with
an ordinary Sharingan could never win against the Mangekyo Sharingan! Even so, the Sharingan is
a ninja’s weapon. A weapon is only as powerful
as its wielder. It can be formidable or weak. You can have shuriken, and be taken down by
a mere pebble thrown by a master. The difference is in the power. It just means that Sasuke’s skills
far exceed Itachi’s expectations. Like I told you… No matter how much you use
those eyes of yours, my hate will turn illusion into reality. Humph… Make illusions a reality, eh? Then let me throw those words
right back at you. Like I told you… No matter how much you use
those eyes of yours, my hate will turn illusion into reality. Humph… Make illusions a reality, eh? Then let me throw those words
right back at you. Amaterasu!

 You saw your eyes gouged out
during the Tsukuyomi just now. Well, allow me to make that a reality. The air around Itachi has shifted! He’s gotten serious. Which means,
we might get to see the Amaterasu. What? The Amaterasu?!
I can’t wait to see it! We were right to come see this,
after all! Continuing to use genjutsu
will lead nowhere. Now that Sasuke has broken
the Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu battle is pointless. Which means from now on,
it’ll be ninjutsu against ninjutsu. If Itachi’s left Mangekyo possesses
the ultimate genjutsu, then his right Mangekyo is
the ultimate in physical attacks. The Amaterasu produces black flames
that are said to never extinguish… Not until it incinerates the target
within the caster’s sight. Is this it, the Amaterasu?! How quick… He’s planning to
not let Itachi weave signs! This is the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu! A rigged shuriken?! That last shuriken did the job. That’s strange… What is it? It’s just that Itachi should have been
able to dodge something like that. Backlash from that earlier Tsukuyomi? I like that. From the moment
Sasuke nullified the Tsukuyomi, he seized control of the flow
of the battle. Plus he slowed down
Itachi’s movements. Sasuke might actually win this battle. No… We don’t know that yet. Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Wounds like this won’t slow me down. Phew… We almost got caught in that! – Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!
– Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Sasuke has the upper hand. I really think Sasuke’s going to… Amaterasu! Ohh… There it is! I-Incredible…
He put out fire with fire. With that jutsu,
he eyes whatever he wants to burn and once the target is in focus,
black flames burst forth. The black flame cannot
be extinguished until the one it targets
is totally incinerated. Even if the target is also fire. I guess Itachi is the winner, after all. He stopped the Amaterasu…
He’s going to take Sasuke’s eyes. Huh? He went below?! Wounds like this won’t
slow me down. I can’t use this Substitution Jutsu
until he unleashes his Amaterasu. This is what I’ve been waiting for! Huh? Fire Style: Fire Jutsu! Hey, pretty good. Oh no! That Amaterasu earlier seems to have
taken quite a toll on you. They’re both totally exhausted.
They have no chakra left, huh? So it appears. This will probably be my last jutsu. The Sharingan can assess chakra. Stop bluffing… I can see that you’re out of chakra. You evaded my Amaterasu using the Orochimaru-style
Substitution Jutsu. A well-made substitution to deceive, but it uses an enormous amount
of chakra. That’s right…
Sasuke did absorb Orochimaru! So that’s it. You’re right.
I don’t have any chakra left. I used it up in that
last Fire Style Jutsu. However… Do you really think I would
come here to kill you unprepared? It will be instantaneous. This jutsu is just like Amaterasu. It is impossible to dodge. Now…
As you wished, I’ll recreate… your death! Oh wow…
I’m glad we chose to see this once.

 I never thought we could see
such a battle.

 Sasuke’s jutsu was impressive,

 but to think Itachi was hiding
that kind of jutsu up his sleeve.

 But looks like it also comes
with a heavy risk…

 Who will win this battle…?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“The End”

 Either way,
the next one will be their last. Seriously! Why do you pile up
this much work?! Sorry. What was Naruto’s registration number? You don’t even know that?
Naruto is #012607. Then how many missions
did Sakura carry out? Nine C-rank, six B-rank,
and seven A-rank missions. Then what is Sai’s height and weight? 172 cm, 53 kg. Captain Yamato’s birthday?! August 10th. What is Kurenai Sensei’s hobby?! Drinking! She enjoys evening drinks! You’re amazing, Lady Tsunade.
You’re aware of everything. Me, on the other hand… Naturally. I am the Hokage! THE OFFICIAL
SHIPPUDEN HANDBOOK


You’re right. How foolish to
even compare myself to you. Oh, by the way…
What is your hobby besides gambling? Oh no… It’s not listed in here! D-Don’t worry about it! After all,
even a Hokage can’t beat old age--! Tune in again!

 NO TRESPASSING In the main hall in Nakano Shrine beneath the seventh tatami mat
from the inner right side is the clan's hidden meeting room. I see... So that's what it is... That's my boy. Your father only talks about you. I wonder what kind of things
Father was saying to Mother. If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me! Brother... No matter what darkness
may await me, if it means killing you,
I will meet it head on! I will obtain that power
no matter what! I obtained power and hatred,
and now I'm here. Itachi! This is where you'll die!
By my hands! The End 

 Now... As you wished, I'll recreate... your death! A jutsu which, like Amaterasu,
cannot be evaded?! What kind of jutsu is it?! I get it! That's what Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu
was for earlier! What do you mean? The target of that Fire Style attack was
never Itachi to begin with! So what does that mean? He purposely released
his Fire Style attack into the sky, causing a sudden warmth
in the atmosphere and he created an ascending air current! Ascending air current? To form cumulonimbus...
In other words, thunder clouds! So what does that mean? Instead of using his own chakra... he intends to take advantage of
the massive energy in the atmosphere to create a Lightning Style Jutsu! What kind? In any case, it'll be on
a totally different scale than what anyone can create
using change in Chakra Nature alone. I see... Sasuke purposely lured Itachi outside, so he could also use the heat
created by Amaterasu. This jutsu brings down thunder
from the heavens. I merely direct its power toward you. Just as I thought...
Which is why it cannot be evaded. Why not?! A bolt of lightning is 1/1000th of a second. It's faster than sound! The name of this jutsu is "Kirin." What's that?! Sasuke has tamed lightning?! Come! Vanish with the roar of thunder... Such power... Did Itachi...die? It's...over. It's over! Is this...the death you wanted to recreate? Damn you! That's...! Without this, I would have been dead. What is that?! You really have...gotten stronger... Sasuke. This time...
I shall show you my final trump card... The Susano'o. I shall show you my final trump card... The Susano'o. Susano'o? Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu... When these two powers awakened, one more jutsu took root in my eyes. Sasuke, is that it for your jutsu? If you are hiding another power,
don't hold back. The real battle is only beginning. The sky is clearing... It seems that last jutsu is limited
to one shot. What's that?! What's the matter? Have you used up your chakra
and run out of options? What?! I can give it to you... I can lend you power... Damn it! You need me, don't you, Sasuke? I thought you were going to
get revenge on Itachi? Now, release my power! Then your wish... Judging by the feel of it... This is Orochimaru's
Eight-Headed Serpent Jutsu. What is that?! It's because Sasuke tried to
squeeze out more power despite having no chakra! Orochimaru's chakra that he'd absorbed
and suppressed has shoved its way to the surface! Finally, it comes out... Is that...?! A gross fellow as always,
puking out stuff from his mouth. Persistent vermin like his namesake... This is it!
This is what I have been waiting for! Thanks to you,
Sasuke's repressing chakra is gone! Now's my chance to take over
the child's body! And...! You think I can be beaten
with that level of attack? Now then, Sasuke...
What will you do next? This sword! It can't be...! The Totsuka Blade?! Itachi... You had it hidden
in your possession...?! What is that sword anyway? The Totsuka Blade,
also known as the Sakegari Blade, is a sword of sealing. It is said to trap and seal away
those it pierces in a genjutsu world of drunken stupor
for all eternity. The blade itself is imbued with
a Sealing Jutsu and is a variant of the Snake Sword. Orochimaru has long searched for it. Itachi's power really is immense! This is it...Sasuke. What's with Itachi's jutsu? That Susano'o jutsu...
it seems to be awfully risky. But... Sasuke's even lost his Sharingan and he's been stripped of Orochimaru. Don't you think Itachi's won
this one already? Now...your eyes are mine. I think I'll take my time to retrieve them. Wha--?! What's this?! Something seems wrong... Damn it! That jutsu he called Susano'o... Its shield is repelling every attack! There's no mistake about it... That is also a spirit weapon. It's called the Yata Mirror and
is said to deflect all things. Combined with the Totsuka Blade
for attacks, he's invincible. They're my eyes... Mine... Itachi went down?! No way?! Itachi is... Itachi is dead? It's Sasuke's victory. Something doesn't feel right... About what? Itachi's strength was greater than this.
His moves weren't normal... Even you said something was weird. That's true... He wasn't able to counter attacks
that he should have countered... He coughed up blood several times
during the fight... Maybe Itachi had sustained
serious damage even before the battle. Was it caused by excessive use
of his Sharingan? No... There's no way we can tell. Damn it! What is this guy?!

 All he's doing is trying to stall us!

 Why can't I hit him with my Rasengan?!

 No... That's not it!

 I did hit him, yet...

 Damn it!

 We can't waste any more time! 

 I have to get past here...

 I have to get to Sasuke!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Mystery of Tobi"

 Make sure to tune in next time!

 Tune in again!

 Let's go, Akamaru! - Yamato!
- Yes sir! Fang Over Fang! Rasengan! What?! You're mine! Huh?! Whoa! What?! I-I can't breathe... I'm keeping you restrained like that! Impossible! I'm really flexible, you see? Now to fight back! Hidden Jutsu! Retreat! Naruto! Kiba! Frill-Necked Lizard! That's all there is to this jutsu. He's toying with us... This formation didn't work either. He skillfully dodged all of our attacks. Kakashi Sensei... Yeah...I know. Naruto... Our formation attack
was timed dead on, right? Yeah... He should have taken a direct hit!
So how was he able to evade it?! We probably did hit him. Huh? It was the same when I first
attacked him with my Rasengan. I was sure I hit him... In other words, he made it look like
he evaded it, when in actuality; he allowed you and your jutsu
to slip right through his body. Is that what you're saying, Naruto? Huh? Umm... Cripes, Shino! It's hard to grasp
what you're trying to say! Maybe it's a clone... or some sort of genjutsu that makes
you see illusions or visions? I-I thought so too,
so I used my Byakugan to increase my field of vision
and checked the chakra. The only chakra I detected is
the one where he is. There we go! Slipped through... No wonder... Kakashi Senpai...
What do you think? No doubt about it. That's some unique jutsu
only he possesses. Which makes it a real bother, but... Shino... I know. The Mystery of Tobi

 For this type of situation, someone like Shino who uses
Hidden Jutsu is useful. Whoa! You're one of
the Aburame clan! Man, all wiggly and gross! Heh! Shino!
You look eager for a change! Of course. That's because I was left out of
that last Sasuke rescue mission. Go! Gross, I tell ya! Hey Shino!
He's dodging them so easily! Rather than a concentrated
pin-point attack, the Aburame clan specializes in making use of space to conduct
a wide-range attack. Naruto, you haven't teamed up
too often with Shino on missions. So let Shino handle this
and watch him. You'll get in the way of his insects. What do you mean
I'll get in the way?! Disperse! Now, he won't be able to get away. There's no way he can
evade all the insects. Oh! Is he dodging or
just slipping through? I'll figure out his jutsu! Do it!
Hidden Jutsu: Beetle Sphere! Wait a sec! All right! Way to go, Shino! I will settle this. Because now that
I'm part of this mission, I must make myself
useful this time! Cripes... You're still bearing that grudge,
aren't you?! The insects are closing in... It's impressive how he can manipulate
so many insects so easily. Well, Hinata? Y-Yes! I'm able to detect
the target's chakra. He is definitely inside the swarm
of Shino's insects. - Yamato!
- Right! We're ready to attack anytime. How is it, Shino? I feel him resisting. That's because the Parasitic Insects
are frantically sucking up his chakra. All right!
Just let 'em suck him dry then! What's going on? My insects,
which were reacting to his chakra, have suddenly lost him. This is impossible... Teleportation Jutsu? No, it wasn't teleportation. Because if it was teleportation, my insects would respond
and follow in his direction. They wouldn't let him escape. Then he used
a Transportation Technique? No...that's impossible. But he...suddenly...just vanished. He traveled through space without weaving signs,
summoning, or using marks? That's a Transportation Technique that
far surpasses the Fourth Hokage! He erased his whole body.
He can erase his entire presence? No way... But if we accept the fact that
he can erase his existence at will, then it follows that he can also erase
just a part of his body as well. Which explains why
a part of his body, which should have been hit by
an external attack, disappeared. And to us, it would look like
the attack went right through him. So he didn't evade the attacks, they really were slipping right
through him. I found him! Over there! Oh! Hello, hello. Don't think you can escape
my nose! Tunneling Fang! Hey, Kiba! Don't be reckless! Did he slip away again? Damn! Kiba... I think this time,
he simply dodged. How did it go? It's over. What...is that? He was on the Akatsuki roster
Kabuto left us with. We keep getting interference! Sasuke has won.
Itachi Uchiha is dead. Sasuke has won.
Itachi Uchiha is dead. What?! I don't believe it! Just kidding... It's as I expected. S-Sasuke...killed...Itachi? Sasuke's down too, but...
I wonder how he is? He's in pretty bad shape. Hey! You there, spiky aloe guy! Where's Sasuke now?! Aloe?! Don't bother with him. I'll take you on another time. That's...a Sharingan?! Who...in the world is he?! Later. We must find Sasuke
before they do! Hinata! Check in the direction
of four o'clock. Y-Yes, sir! Byakugan! I can see strong chakra over
a wide scope about ten kilometers ahead. Also...for some reason...
the forest is burning... from black flames. Amaterasu?! That's it!
Everyone, follow me! This time for sure! Full speed ahead! You're late. I'm not you,
so I can't move as fast. If you were watching,
you better have recorded all of it. Relax. Everything is recorded. I'll take a good look later. We're taking Itachi's corpse too.
We should go now. I detected their scents. They've already reached
where Sasuke is. Damn them! So this is Amaterasu...
I've never seen it before! What is that? That is Itachi's jutsu! Be careful! That fire will not go out until it
completely incinerates anything it ignites. Yamato! Yes, Senpai! Earth Style!
Planet Splitter! Please proceed! Right! Everyone, except Yamato,
follow me! Quit wasting time. You're... Zetsu. Tsk. We're not wasting time. So it's over? Yeah, it's settled. What about Sasuke? He's okay. Sasuke won. And...where's Sasuke? He's already been evacuated
to a safe place. Safe place? Akatsuki's hideout in the east.
You should head there too. The Hidden Leaf will come here
very shortly. Let's go...to where Sasuke is! What will you do, Kisame? If Itachi passed away,
I think I'll spread my wings for a while. I see... Do as you please. What happened here anyway? What kind of battle would cause this? Two Sharingan users... Is the battle between the Uchiha Clan...
this intense? Where's Sasuke? I don't detect any other chakra
besides ours in this area. There's still a faint smell left, but... We were too late... Naruto... Why? Why is it that I can never
reach Sasuke? I treated your wounds. You won. But you've sustained quite
a bit of damage as well. Try not to force yourself up. We've met once before. That appearance... You're... The last time, it was as enemies. Don't worry about Deidara's death... I am not your enemy. I brought you here in order to
tell you something. You're not interested at all, I see... Maybe if I put it another way,
you'll want to listen? It is about Itachi Uchiha. Yes... You think you know
about your brother, but you know nothing. Oh, all right...
Let's start with introductions. Like you, I am a survivor
of the Uchiha Clan... And the one who knows
the truth about Itachi Uchiha. It can't be! What was that just now? The Amaterasu,
which Itachi implanted inside you. How like Itachi. He surprises you
even after he's dead. To think he planned things this far... What are you talking about? In order to kill me,
he placed a jutsu into you... Or rather should I say;
in order to keep me away from you... He probably set his Amaterasu
to self-activate when you look into my Sharingan. Even Itachi didn't know
everything about me... Otherwise I would be dead right now. So this was his fail-safe plan... Although it didn't work on me. So...what's this all about? Before he died, Itachi must've done
something to you. At the end...for your sake, he transferred his own
ocular powers to you. What are you saying?
Just...what are you trying to say? Why would Itachi do
something like that?! Don't you get it? In order to...protect you. To protect me?!

 Are you kidding me?

 You think you know about your brother,
but you know nothing.

 If you continue speaking such nonsense,
I'll kill you!

 What I'm saying is the truth.

 Itachi did mention it, did he not?

 About his accomplice that night?

you went to sleep. <i>Damn it...
And I was so careful...</i> <i>I can't believe I got caught
 in a Genjutsu...!</i> Genjutsu? Are you going to teach me Genjutsu,
Pervy Sage?! <i>To be exact, I'm going to teach you
how to break a Genjutsu.</i> How to break...a Genjutsu...? Listen up, Naruto. There's a trick to breaking
a Genjutsu if you get caught in one--. Pervy Sage. You should know that trick very well... Hey, Pervy Sage! What?! I want to know about
how to cast a Genjutsu, not about if I get caught in one! Huh? Wh-What's up with that reaction?! Listen up, Naruto... A Genjutsu works on
an opponent's five senses. You can control the Chakra flowing
through their cerebral nervous system. It's a Ninjutsu requiring
a great deal of intelligence. Hmm... I don't really get it... I didn't think so... Nobody is telling you to
master Genjutsu. You're not a Genjutsu-type Shinobi
at all in the first place... Huh? Really? Then forget about Genjutsu! Let's get to my next training,
my next training! That won't do! Why not?! Some enemies use Genjutsu,
after all. For example, Itachi Uchiha! Come to think of it, even Kakashi Sensei
was beaten by his technique... That's why you need to know
how to deal with Genjutsu! Fine. When you're in a Genjutsu, the Chakra inside your head
is being controlled. So if you get caught in one, make sure you temporarily stop the flow of your own Chakra
as best you can. Stop the flow...of Chakra...? Thanks to your training until now, you've subconsciously
concentrated Chakra at the bottom of your feet and
are standing on the water. Now that you mention it... You need to temporarily stop all of it.
Give it a try. Right! First, I need to stop
the flow of Chakra. Then with power greater
than your opponent, you need to immediately disrupt
the flow of Chakra in one shot! Got it! If you do that... the Genjutsu will be broken! <i>Guy Sensei...!</i> <i>I'm running out of breath...</i> <i>Tenten's reached her limit, huh...?</i> Water Style: Shark Bomb Jutsu! <i>What incredible power...</i> I know! You're... It's too late for you...
to remember now! Guy Sensei! <i>Guy Sensei... Don't tell me...!</i> <i>Guy Sensei won't
be beaten that easily!</i> <i>That guy...
I know I've met him somewhere...</i> Don't think I'm done settling
the score just yet. Water Style... Five Hungry Sharks! First Meal! Second Meal! Third Meal! <i>No effect, huh...?</i> Fourth Meal! Fifth Meal! My five sharks will completely devour you
and leave no bones! <i>Tenten!</i> <i>This is not good...
She's reached her limit...</i> <i>I can't be slowed down any further...</i> <i>I have no choice...</i> What's he planning? <i>The Eight Inner Gates...
First Gate, Gate of Opening, Open!</i> <i>Second Gate, Gate of Rest.</i> <i>Third Gate, Gate of Life.</i> <i>Fourth Gate, Gate of Pain.</i> What's this remarkable power...? <i>Fifth Gate, Gate of Closing, Open!</i> What?! <i>Wh-What's that?!</i> <i>There's an incredible amount of Chakra
being emitted from the water!</i> <i>Guy...</i> <i>Surely he's not going to
use that, is he?</i> The Eight Inner Gates! Sixth Gate,
Gate of Joy...Open! What's this?! <i>Now!</i> <i>Here!</i> 8 Trigrams 64 Palms! Severe Leaf Hurricane! Are you okay, Tenten? Y-Yeah... Thanks, Neji... We're saved... That stance is...! He has grown. Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
Come on back. Doctor, something's wrong
with my body! Doctor, what's this? Hmm, it's some terribly dry skin. No, it's not just that! Oho, this is sure a large corn. Look at this, too! Th-That large growth on your shoulder...! Hmm, it's the boil
I've heard rumors about, no mistake. Doctor, what should I do? Oh, you don't need to worry.
The baby in your belly is doing just fine! - What?!
- Congratulations. Hey, just a minute. I'm a guy! Next episode:
"The Secret Weapon is Called..." Protect? Did you say protect?! You've got to be kidding! I'll say it once more... You think you know about your brother,
but you know nothing. If you continue speaking
such nonsense, I'll kill you! You're not making this easy, are you? I suppose that's natural though... Suddenly being told such a story
by a stranger like me. But what I tell you is the truth. Itachi did mention it, did he not?
About his accomplice that night. I am that  Madara Uchiha. I know everything about Itachi. I suppose Itachi died
without realizing that. Shut up!
Such things don't matter anymore! Just get out of my sight! No, you will listen.
You need to hear this. It's your obligation! For the sake of the ninja world... For the sake of
the Hidden Leaf Village... And for your sake... Your brother risked everything.
You will know how Itachi Uchiha lived! Do you know why? Why Itachi implanted Amaterasu
into your eye? Itachi was determined to make sure
that you and I would not meet. You will understand why,
as well as everything else, when you hear me out. Those who knew the truth about Itachi were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf,
the Third Hokage, and his advisors Homura and Koharu.
Just those four. The Third Hokage died...
and now, there are only three aging folk. Still, those three will probably
never reveal the abominable truth. The truth about Itachi will fade
into darkness forever. And that is what Itachi wished. However, I know the truth
about Itachi too. As I said earlier...
Itachi died without realizing that. However, he wanted to
make doubly sure. It seems Itachi did not trust me. So just in case I did know the truth, he planned to silence me
with the Amaterasu. He probably anticipated I would show
my Sharingan in order to speak to you. What is this? What is this guy saying? Protect me? Protect?! The truth? Think back. Think carefully and
remember about Itachi. About your kind brother. What's wrong? This is it, right?
The place where Father works. This is the headquarters of
the Hidden Leaf Police Force. I've always been curious. Why is the Uchiha crest
on the police force logo? What? You noticed that? Who wouldn't? Well...let's see... Simply put, it seems our ancestors formed
and organized this police force. And so, they used our family crest
as the symbol of this organization. From ages past, our clan has been entrusted
with the safety of the village. The Uchiha crest reflects
the pride of our clan. While its numbers have dwindled, even today, nearly everyone in
the clan serves on Squad One and is dedicated to preserving
the peace and safety of the village. After all, only exceptional ninja are capable
of preventing crimes that ninja commit. Father is great, after all! Are you going to work here too? I wonder about that... You should! No, he... He tried to kill me! He tried to take my eyes... Who would do such a thing?! Foolish little brother... Mangekyo Sharingan! Calm down! Breathe slowly. Don't touch me! Even if you do hate me... That's what big brothers are for. Sorry, Sasuke... Another time. Fate    

 You're awake... Sorry, but I took the liberty
of tying you up. Since you weren't gonna stay still
and listen to me. He... Itachi was my enemy. He killed our parents...
He killed everyone in the clan. He was a Rogue Ninja...
A member of the Akatsuki... He was despicable. He was my target. It's true... that he annihilated
the Uchiha clan that night. And he deserted the Hidden Leaf. Then... And that is what he was ordered
to do by the Hidden Leaf. That is the beginning of
the truth about Itachi. It was his mission? Yes. That night, Itachi killed his personal feelings
and fulfilled his mission. It seems you've calmed down a bit. What are you talking about?! In order to talk about Itachi, I must take you back to the early days
when Hidden Leaf Village was founded. Itachi sacrificed himself. This is fate that has continued
since ages past. He was sacrificed for it. Sacrifice? That's correct. A huge problem rooted since the time
Hidden Leaf Village was founded. That is what determined Itachi's life. It's a long story,
but everything I tell you is the truth. On what basis should I believe you? You're untrustworthy. There's nothing I can show you
as proof. And it's up to you whether
you believe me or not. But you will hear me out until I finish. Fine... So talk. It all started more
than 80 years ago. The world was in turmoil.
It was the age of war. Nations battled for power and
to increase their territories. During this age of war, ninjas consisted of individual clans
serving as armed units. They were hired by various nations
to participate in the fighting. And among the many ninja clans,
two were feared as the strongest. One was us, the Uchiha clan. And the other was known
as the Forest's Senju Clan. We of the Uchiha clan possessed
exceptional chakra and the Sharingan. Excelling in all types of warfare,
we became known as a battle clan. And I was born into the Uchiha clan, possessing chakra that
was especially powerful. Perhaps the fact that I've lived
this long is proof of that. Back in those days,
all I did was battle. In an age defined by power, I sought to become ever stronger and killed my friends and
even my younger brother. Why you...! As a result, I came into possession
of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan, and became the leader of the Uchiha. And using that power,
I fought the Senju clan countless times. It was inevitable that I face Hashirama,
the leader of the Senju clan. "Wood Style" Hashirama Senju,
the future first Hokage. The one who stood at
the top of the ninja world... And the one I respected most. The Senju clan, led by Hashirama
who became the First Hokage, was feared and respected
by all the other clans. If the Senju moved,
so did the Uchiha. Our clan was probably the only clan
able to compete with them. If a nation hired the Senju, the opposing nation would hire
the Uchiha. We were like rivals. The more I went up against Hashirama, the more my name became known
as well. To get close to the top...
to measure my abilities... To heighten your reputation... You took your younger brother's eyes
just for that?! I did take them. But I needed power in order
to protect the Uchiha. Protect? Yes. As the Uchiha name spread,
its enemies increased. It was a necessary sacrifice
to protect the clan during the fierce fighting with the Senju,
and the other clans. It was not for my fame. My younger brother was
in total agreement and offered his eyes to me. But one day,
the Senju clan offered a truce. And the Uchiha accepted it. Everyone, in both clans,
had grown weary of the fighting that had dragged on for so long. They had enough. But I... I was the only one who opposed it. Where has all the hate gone?! For what purpose had my brother
sacrificed himself?! The Uchiha and Senju are
like oil and water. I couldn't help fearing that in time, the Uchiha clan would come to
be oppressed by the Senju clan. However...everyone in the Uchiha clan
wanted a truce. As their leader, I had no choice
but to go along with their wishes. Shortly thereafter, the ninja alliance
signed a pact with the Land of Fire, which had sought dominion
over the territories. The secure one nation, one village system
was formed and became the Land of Fire and
the Village Hidden in the Leaves. Other countries adopted
the one nation, one village system. And subsequently,
the fires of war were extinguished. Momentary peace. But due to a certain incident, the Hidden Leaf Village quickly
descended into turmoil. A certain incident? A fight...for the First Hokage's seat. As you know, the first to occupy
that seat was Hashirama Senju. The Land of Fire and
the entire clan chose Hashirama. It was inevitable that the Uchiha's hold on
the reins of power would loosen. I decided that the Uchiha
should take leadership... That we should confront Hashirama... But no one, not even from
the Uchiha clan, supported me. My subordinates, who did not wish
to light the fires of war, were unsympathetic and betrayed me. I was accused of acting
out of greed and self-interest. Not only that... They scorned me as
a selfish brother who stole his younger brother's eyes
in order to save his own. What brother would willfully
hurt his younger brother?! I just...I just wanted to
protect the Uchiha! I left the village. Everyone betrayed me. I became an avenger and declared
war on the Hidden Leaf Village. And I lost... At that place which became known
as the Final Valley. I was said...to have died there. Even Hashirama believed it. And everyone forgot about me...
History forgot about me. Hashirama's younger brother
who became the Second Hokage was determined that there would
never be a traitor like me again. So, as proof of his trust, he granted
the Uchiha a special position... And he created
the Hidden Leaf Police Force. But the truth is... This was to further distance the Uchiha
from the reins of government. Furthermore, it was a way to keep
a close eye on the entire clan. There were Uchiha members
who realized this... Members who wanted to carry
on my rebellion. But...it was too late. Time passed... The Senju clan solidified
its hold on power and the Uchiha fell to
becoming Senju dogs. And what I predicted came to pass. A certain other incident sealed
Uchiha's figurative demise. Yes... The attack of the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon
16 years ago. What do you mean? The Nine-Tails can only be tamed
and controlled by the ocular powers of the Uchiha. The higher-ups of Hidden Leaf Village
perceived the Uchiha to be behind this attack. That was a natural occurrence,
a natural calamity. The Uchiha had nothing to do with it. Yet suspicion fell on them... That the Uchiha had revolted
and sought to take power. As a result,
the Uchiha was put under the strict surveillance of
the Anbu Black Ops, and they were forced to relocate
to the outskirts of the village. They became totally estranged. The Third Hokage was the only one
to voice opposition to our treatment. But Danzo of the Anbu Black Ops and the rest of the councilors
would not listen. In the end,
the Uchiha clan was not trusted. And the discrimination began... Their distrust bred hatred and eventually,
their suspicions became reality. The Uchiha clan plotted
a coup d'état to take over the village... The higher-ups in Hidden Leaf Village
planted a spy within the Uchiha clan. That spy was your older brother... Itachi Uchiha. From that moment,
Itachi's suffering began. You laid false charges
against the Uchiha!

 That's Itachi's lie.

 I won't believe it!
Itachi tried to kill me!

 If he really wanted to,
you certainly would be dead. However...

 Stop it! I've had enough!

 You should know why.
Because you are...

 Next time, on Naruto Shippuden:
"Truth"

 That is Itachi's truth. Tune in again!

 The attack of the Nine-Tailed
Fox Demon 16 years ago. Suspicion fell on them. That the Uchiha had revolted
and sought to take power. As a result, the Uchiha was put under the strict
surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops, and they were forced to relocate
to the outskirts of the village. They became totally estranged. Their distrust bred hatred
and eventually, their suspicions became reality. The Uchiha clan plotted
a coup d'état to take over the village... The higher-ups in Hidden Leaf Village
planted a spy within the Uchiha clan. That spy was your older brother... Itachi Uchiha. From that moment,
Itachi's suffering began. A coup d'état by the Uchiha? Itachi was...a spy? Despite being an Uchiha,
you were kept in the dark. Because you were still young. But it's all true... Your father, Fugaku,
was the mastermind behind the plot. And your brother, Itachi,
was ordered by your father to spy on the Anbu Black Ops. Itachi... You also serve as
the Uchiha clan's pipeline to the Village nerve center. You know that, don't you? However...it was actually the opposite. Itachi was working for the village, feeding them information
about the Uchiha. He was what they call
a double agent. You can't even imagine
what a heavy burden that is to bear. Why?! Why did Itachi betray the Uchiha? It may be hard for you
to understand, not having witnessed the horrors of war. The Third Great Ninja War... When Itachi was merely
four years old, he witnessed the deaths
of many people. He was too young to experience war. War is hell... That trauma made Itachi
a pacifist who hated war. He was a man who put
the village's safety first, and who strove to preserve peace. Instead of being bound
by obligation to his clan, he was a ninja who loved his village. And the village higher-ups
preyed on that trait. They assigned him to
a top-secret mission. An eye for an eye... For them to oppose the Uchiha,
they would need the Sharingan. Yes. The mission was... The total annihilation of
the Uchiha clan. I can't even begin to imagine
what he went through emotionally. Itachi was forced to make
a terrible choice. The impossible choice of killing
one's own brethren. But a civil war started by the likes
of the Uchiha would shake the very foundations of Hidden Leaf Village
and the Land of Fire. Other nations would waste no time
in seizing the opportunity to attack. It could even trigger
a Fourth Great Ninja War... The Uchiha clan's self-interest would
involve innocent people who had nothing to do with
the ninja world. And countless people would die
once again. If you were Itachi,
what would you have done? So Itachi made up his mind. He himself would bring
the curtain down on his clan. He did not hate the Uchiha
nor did he betray them. It was inevitable. The discrimination by the village...
and the object of their antagonism... He shouldered the blame all by himself. No one can ever question Itachi's decision
and the sacrifice he made. To be truthful, back then,
even I anticipated war. I was bitter towards Senju's
Hidden Leaf Village as well as the Uchiha. But Itachi was even aware of that. He alone was aware
of my existence. Itachi sought to contact me
and made certain conditions. In exchange for guiding me
in my vendetta against the Uchiha, I was not to lay a hand on the village. He would help me kill our brethren... But the Third Hokage tried
a different hand. He tried to approach the Uchiha
for a compromise. But time ran out,
and his efforts failed. Leading to that night. It was a mission. To be the sole perpetrator
of his clan's slaughter and become a Rogue Ninja
with his reputation in tatters. All of that was his mission. And Itachi completely fulfilled
his duty... With one exception... He could not bring himself...
to kill his younger brother. Truth    

 After that, Itachi appealed
to the Third Hokage to protect you from Danzo
and the higher-ups. Then he threatened Danzo
and left the village. If he laid a hand on Sasuke, he would leak every detail about
the village to unallied nations. Above all else,
he was concerned about you. And yet he couldn't tell you
the full truth. He had no choice
but to say the things he did. It's a lie... This isn't like you, Big Brother...
It can't be... I acted like the older brother
you desired... in order to measure your vessel. You will become a rival
to measure my vessel against... You have that hidden potential. You've been jealous of me
and resented me. You've harbored hopes
of surpassing me. That is why I am allowing you to live.
For my sake... My foolish little brother... If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me. And survive...in obscurity. Run...keep running...
and cling to life. Then one day, come before me with
the same eye that I possess. By making revenge your goal,
he hoped to make you strong. The Uchiha is a proud clan
of the Hidden Leaf. He wanted you to keep
believing that. He beseeched the Hokage that
you never learn the truth. And from the moment
he left the village, he was resolved to fighting you,
and dying. So that he could instill in you
a new power. That is Itachi's truth. No, you're lying. They must be lies. That's nonsense... He almost killed me several times! If Itachi wished it, he would have.
Without a doubt. He even used the Mangekyo Sharingan
to try to kill me! That's why...! Your battle was part of his plan. Itachi needed to pressure you
in that fight. The reason for that... Well, you probably realized it too,
haven't you? Finally, it comes out... He freed you of the curse mark. And the death of someone
closest to you... It was a battle to awaken
your Mangekyo. It was a battle that Itachi planned
entirely for your sake. He pretended to be after
your eyes until the very end. It's starting to sink in, I see... You are lying. The one who made the Nine-Tails attack
the village was you, Madara! Itachi said so. Sixteen years ago, Madara instigated the Nine-Tails' attack
on Hidden Leaf Village. But that too was foiled
by the Fourth Hokage. In short... Madara is a bitter, defeated loser... He is not worthy of becoming
the best among the Uchiha. I am the one... who shall surpass Madara
and become the ultimate ninja! You framed the Uchiha! And you teamed up with Itachi
to toy with the clan! Itachi was lying
when he told you that. Itachi feared that you would
somehow learn the truth. He wanted to make absolutely certain
there was no chance of that. He lied to make sure
you would not trust me... Not only that,
he implanted Amaterasu in your eyes. As if I'd believe you! He... Itachi was evil! He's a criminal who killed his clan
and joined Akatsuki! Itachi took sole responsibility for
an unspeakable crime and left the village. Then he found a way to join Akatsuki
and watched over an organization that was dangerous
to the village from the inside. He was always thinking
about Hidden Leaf Village. And he thought of you... When the Third Hokage,
who had promised to protect you, died... Itachi made an appearance
in Hidden Leaf Village. It was to tell Danzo and
the other superiors that "I am alive." You were foremost in his thoughts-- Stop! Lies! They're all lies... You're still alive, aren't you? In order to survive, we cling to all
we know and understand. And we label it reality. But knowledge and understanding
are ambiguous. That reality could be an illusion. All humans live with
the wrong assumptions. Isn't that another way of looking at it? That Sharingan...
How much can you actually see? My eye is not like it was in the past! My Sharingan can see
through genjutsu! Humph...
You still speak with such confidence. But for now,
I'll take your word for it. Your eyes did not perceive
a single thing about Itachi. You were not able to see through
the illusion Itachi created at all. Itachi killed his friends, his superiors... He killed his lover,
his father and his mother. But he could not kill...his little brother. He cried tears of blood and killed every shred of feeling
he had inside him, then he killed his brethren
for the sake of his village. But he just couldn't kill you. Do you understand what that means? To him, your life...
was more precious than the village. Until the moment of his death... No, even in death, it was all for you. To pass on a new power... By making you defeat him,
he had avenged the Uchiha clan. In order to raise and make you
the hero of Hidden Leaf Village. His body was ravaged by illness
and he knew he was near death. Even if he had to rely on drugs
to prolong his life... For the sake of
his beloved little brother... He had to fight you...
and die in your presence. For the peace of Hidden Leaf Village,
and most of all, for Sasuke Uchiha. He wanted to die
as a criminal and a traitor. He accepted disgrace
in the place of honor, and hate in the place of love. And despite that, Itachi died
with a smile on his face. He entrusted the Uchiha name to you,
his younger brother, deceiving you to the very end. I'm home. Welcome home, Big Brother! Play with me, Big Brother! Huh? What'll we play?! Sasuke! Your brother has
Academy homework to do. You can play after he's done. Huh? That's okay.
I can do my homework later. It's easy anyway. Goodness... Where could Big Brother be hiding? Found you, Big Brother. You're pretty sharp, Sasuke. However...too bad. Ah! No fair! Say, Father... Hmm? Brother and I were playing
hide-and-seek today, but Big Brother used Clone Jutsu
to run away. That's not fair, is it? Hmm... You're able to do
the Clone Jutsu already? Big Brother, teach me
the Clone Jutsu too, after dinner! Homework! Sorry, Sasuke.
Let's do it some other time. Sasuke. It's time to go. You said that you would teach me
a new shuriken jutsu. I have an important mission tomorrow
that I must prepare for. You're a liar... Sorry, Sasuke.
Maybe some other time. Big Brother, watch this! Hey! Don't be reckless... Big Brother... Will you train with me again? Yeah... But I'm assigned to missions
and starting tomorrow, you will be attending
the Ninja Academy. We won't have much time
to spend together. That's okay. As long as you can stay with me
once in a while. But, we only have each other
as siblings. Even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome. Big Brother... Can you help me with
shuriken training today? I'm busy.
You should ask Father to teach you. But you're better than Father
when it comes to shuriken jutsu. Even a kid like me can see that. Oww. Sorry, Sasuke... Some other time. Even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome... I'm always going to be there for you. Even if you do hate me... That's what big brothers are for. Sorry, Sasuke... This is it. We are no longer "Hebi." From this day on,
our team will be "Taka." Taka has only one goal. We... will destroy the Hidden Leaf. The light hurts my eyes...

 Noon already?

 Damn it, bastard!
Screw you, man!

 Training from the morning,
stomach so starving,

 Rap-loving weirdo,
that's what I am.

 Lunch menu Suikiyaki for sure, yeah...

 Humph, looks like that's him.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Battle of Unraikyo"

 Eight-Tails, I'm here to capture you.

 Tune in again!

 Kakashi Senpai... If there is even a faint scent that lingers from Sasuke... Yeah...that's right. No way can we give up
after coming this far. We'll see this through until the end. Until there's absolutely
no trace of Sasuke's scent. Byakugan! Nothing... Please, find him. Sasuke... Yeah...I know. There's no trace of Sasuke's scent. Dammit... Where did you go? We've done what we could... Let's go back to the Hidden Leaf... Sasuke... Battle of Unraikyo

 What are you doing? The preparations are already complete. When I look upon the full moon,
it takes me back to that night. As well as... the memories I've been trying to forget. Now I can finally recall things
about Itachi... Faint memories buried deep in my heart are floating back to the surface. Run...keep running... and cling to life. Then one day, come before me with
the same eye that I possess. Wait! He was crying at that moment. I thought I had imagined it. I didn't realize... It seems what you told me was true. So what will you do? Are you going to transplant Itachi's eyes? No... What Itachi wanted to see,
and what I will see hereafter, will be completely different. I can't do as Itachi wished me to do. I will restore the Uchiha clan
in my own way. Umm... I need to talk to you,
Kisame Senpai. First Zetsu,
now you come bothering me? I actually thought you were dead. It turns out that you will be
the last to know. I'm sorry that I had to deceive you,
the person closest to me. Hmm? So that's how it was. I never would have guessed
that Tobi was you. But I'm relieved... If you're the one pulling the strings,
that makes it easier for me... Former Lord Mizukage...
I mean, Madara. I shall continue to count on you, Kisame. The same goes for me. Itachi is out... And now, his little brother joins. What an interesting turn of events. We, Taka, will destroy the Hidden Leaf. You say that, but how do you intend
to go about it? We're going to kill the Elders. The others are not
our immediate concern. If you aim high,
the ones below will shield them. It won't be that easy. You so-called "Taka" don't have
enough strength for that. Kisame Senpai... You shouldn't underestimate us. We still haven't settled that
last game of ours. This time, I'm serious... Stop it, Suigetsu! Sasuke! You haven't trained them well. He stopped it with just his arm...! Suigetsu! Are you stupid?
This isn't the place to... My objective is his Shark Skin Sword! I've been hanging with Sasuke only
so I could get that! Sasuke... What'll you do? All right... Go for it if you want to, Suigetsu. You probably can't beat him
yet anyway. Yet, huh? Oh...thanks a lot, Sasuke. Just hold tight. I'll treat you to some tasty shark's fin
soon enough. The Akatsuki is also low on manpower. I'd like to avoid unnecessary skirmishes. Humph. Then you shouldn't
criticize others, you guys. We share common interests. From here on, Taka will work together
with the Akatsuki. And what's in it for us? We'll give you a Tailed Beast. Tailed Beast? You don't know about them? I know! It's like the Nine-Tails, with chakra physically manifesting
as tails, they're mon- In other words? They're chakra monsters. Originally, the First Hokage collected
several of them and kept them under his control. Each time a Great Ninja War threatened, the Hokage Hashirama used them
to maintain the power balance and distributed them to other lands,
starting with the five great nations, as proof of alliances or agreements. You could call them
the ultimate chakra weapons. It's not a bad preposition. That's quite generous. However, if you betray the Akatsuki,
you will die accordingly. Humph... There are nine Tailed Beasts
in this world. The Akatsuki has collected six so far...
so there are three left. The Akatsuki and Taka will split up
to hunt the remaining three. That is our immediate goal. You don't have the Nine-Tails yet, right? Taka will capture the Eight-Tails. The Akatsuki will hunt the rest.
Which includes Naruto... How did it go? It went well... That's good. Itachi is dead...
So our eyesore's finally gone. And now,
we need no longer keep our pact to stay away from the Hidden Leaf. We've waited so long... All so we could proceed
according to plan. This is fine. But Itachi had placed insurance
in Sasuke. The Amaterasu. Itachi believed that no one knew
the truth about him. So why go so far...? True intentions aside, he probably feared I would try
to recruit Sasuke. But...who would have thought that the Akatsuki would lose so
many members to get to this point. We had problems at every turn... But everyone made a valuable contribution
in their own way. Deidara... Sasori... Hidan... Kakuzu... Without them,
we could not have gotten this far. Thanks to them, the scenario is
playing out just as I planned. Most importantly...
I've won Sasuke over. So? Where is this thing called
"the Eight-Tails"? Don't take us lightly... We have no intention
of telling you a thing. We, the Yotsuki clan,
never betray our comrades. That is- Doubt exists...in a fearful heart. Suigetsu, enough. He's under Sasuke's genjutsu. Shucks... I was just getting
to the fun part. Tell me where the Eight-Tails is. He is training...at Unraikyo,
Storm Cloud Ravine. Any distinguishing features? He...wields eight blades... And has bull horns tattooed on his...
left cheek. Sheesh...
Those eyes of his have improved. Now he's even more difficult
to deal with. Oh wow...
Sasuke's gotten even cooler. This is a nice place... I think I could control
my impulses here. It's calming... UNRAIKYO You make my eyes hurt... Light... Noon already? Damn it, bastard! Screw you, man! Training from mornin',
stomach so starvin' I'm just a rap-lovin' guy and just decided on sukiyaki for lunch! Yay! Hm...?! Are you the Jinchuriki host
of the Eight-Tails? No, it's Lord Eight-Tails. Okay? Say, "Are you Lord Jinchuriki?" Okay? I'm here to capture you. No. You have to say,
"Please allow me to capture you, sir." Okay? Right? Suigetsu, you take the right. Jugo, you take the left. Karin, get behind me. Hmm... Let's see. Right in the middle of our conversation... Here's some serious advice! You're fools! Fools. We can't kill the Jinchuriki. Isn't that what the Akatsuki
told us, Suigetsu? It's all right. I can feel his chakra. Geez, talk about a showy diversion. Why you...! The only one who gets
to dig me is me... So scram, you fools, or I'll blast y'all! You fools... Yeah! Suigetsu, get back. I'm peeking through...
And see you alive... But y'all are so brainless! Stop joking around! My thirst for blood is my courage... Making me so optimistic. My blades are swirlin',
but my store's a closin'. Making for a blow-out sale
for my performance! Yeah... I've got spare power and
my appeal is glowing, Eight-Tails the bridge. Killer Bee, that's me! Ah! Yay! Start fighting and
you're gonna be embarrassed. 'Cuz you'll be torn apart... Bit my tongue... Wh-What's with this guy? He's totally crazy, but that Jugo... He keeps dodging
my Executioner's blade... What is this guy?! You made me bite my tongue... Fools! Are you all right?! Yeah... I'll go. Who the heck are you all?
Fools... You fools! This guy's getting on my nerves! Who are you?
Why would you capture me? Huh? We don't owe you an explanation. A guy who talks in weird verses...
is such a pain to deal with. It's to obtain power
as quickly as possible. If you don't like it, leave. Tsk... That's your prerogative... I also want to confirm whether the Akatsuki's verbal promise is
true or false and get it over with. Either way, we're the ones who
are going to use the Akatsuki. Keep that in mind. The Akatsuki? That goes without question. Y-You are so cool, Sasuke! I knew he wouldn't let himself
be used as a pawn. Well then, let's get to it and
silence this irritating rapper. I intend to. Your illusions I obliterate,
then you all I shall annihilate!

 My true form of the Jinchuriki...

 It's a Monster, so watch it now,
Host Transformation, yeah.

 Eight-Tails will pee your pants,
you lil' ants!

 To spear my foes,
my glorious longhorns!

 Wheeeee!!!

 Such chakra...
Is this even possible?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Eight-Tails vs. Sasuke"

 That's his...true form?!

 Hinata... Huh? Y-Yes?! That episode where you said,
"N-Naruto"... I heard it was quite a hit. Especially among the guys. Huh?! R-Really? You know, that's cool how
you can boost popularity just by saying names, Hinata! Right?! Sakura... Why look at me when you say that? Huh? Well... Why this difference in
the treatment of heroines? If I get down to business, even I can... - You're embarrassed.
- N-Naruto... - When you're happy...
- Naruto. - Sexy.
- Naruto... - Cry.
- N-Naruto. - Panicked.
- Naruto. - Scream it out.
- N-Naruto! How was that? That's good...
Is what I'd like to say. But Sakura won't be saying lines
like that. So we won't need them. Huh?! Quit joking around. Cha! STUDIO



 Tune in again!

 Let's get to it and
silence this irritating rapper. I intend to. It's not irritating... It's cool rhythms and rhymes.
You fool! Ah! Yeah!! He's really...irritating! He's got zero rapping talent! What?! You fool! You jerk! Will you shut up?! The pain in my chest, baby!
Is like from your kicking, yo!
You're not running now, come on!
We're settling this score
'til I'm kicking, YEAH! RHYME NOTES I'm feeling good right now. Just came up with
the greatest rhyme. Thank you. That's why I'll play with you...
You foolish baby! Watch out, Sasuke!
This guy's used to handling blades! He's no ordinary ninja! I'll give you a taste of my hook. The Eight-Tails vs. Sasuke

 Wha--? What's with that stance? Sasuke! Are you all right?! What's with those moves? I can't read through
his line of attack. Chidori? He plans to use
his indefensible Chidori Blade! What?! He countered it?! He can stream his chakra too?! Float... Float like a butterfly...! Eight-Tails! Sting like a bee! Sasuke! And this is the finishing sting! He also uses...
Lightning Style, which is my weakness. Sasuke! Sasuke! This is bad... Here, Sasuke... Hurry up and bite me! Do it now! He funneled the Lightning Style
through his body and shifted the course of my attack. He avoided a fatal injury... And...that woman possesses
the ability to heal others by letting them
suck her chakra. Thanks, Karin. Sure... Sasuke! Let's do this together! The fact is this guy is super strong. We should go at him as if
we are trying to kill him, instead of not. That way we can probably take him
down without killing him. Looks like this battle is gonna drag on... Check it out, yo! Got you! Sasuke, now! Just do the both of us! Chidori! Gone! Where is he? So weak, yet so persistent... I'm done playing,
now go home for some drinking! Yeah! - Karin!
- I know... Over there! That woman's also a sensory-type, eh? Can't be helped... Going with the eighth tail. Here it comes... It's the same as back then. Hmm... He's the first to dodge
my eight-tails form since my brother. Damn, he's going after the others! First, you guys will be torn apart! Are you all right? Yeah...more or less... He definitely has speed and power. But he only moves in
a linear fashion. My eyes should be able to
make them out. Karin! Read his chakra and
predict his movements! Stay on him and keep me informed
of his location at all times! That's if you can really keep up! Sasuke! Those eyes... The Sharingan!
Is this genjutsu? I can't move my body. Lariat! Sasuke! Wha--?! What is this? His neck and chest portion have
been blown off, organs and all. He's beyond our... He is like my reincarnation. Hang in there! Karin, it's all right. I'll do it. The chakra you have now
can't deal with it. What do you intend to do? I'll distribute my body and chakra to
Sasuke by merging with him. Since his body was compatible with
my curse mark, it should work. In order to release the genjutsu, I need a partner to disturb
my chakra and awaken me. My partner is
the Eight-Tails inside me. A genjutsu has no effect on
the Jinchuriki host, which controls a Tailed Beast. Your illusions I obliterate,
then you all I shall annihilate. My true form of the Jinchuriki... It's a monster, so watch it now, Host Transformation, yeah... Eight-Tails will pee your pants,
you lil' ants! Such chakra...
Is this even possible? That's the Eight-Tails? An ox-octopus monster...
That's his true form? To spear my foes,
my glorious longhorns! His chakra is off the scale... We'll die if we stay here! Jugo, are you done yet?! Thank goodness... Sasuke... You're conscious.
Come on, get up! All right, Jugo... Huh?! He turned into a child?! Why?! Jugo... I won't let you die... You're a memento of Kimimaro. Come on! Hurry! We gotta run! A Water-Style ninja... I knew it. You have the advantage
of the terrain! I'll take over from here! Run while you can! Suigetsu... Let's go, Sasuke. Heh. Who would've thought... that I'd end up sacrificing myself
to save their hides this often? As if I'd let you get away after
what you've done, you fool, you jerk! Th-That really doesn't look good. Could that be Lord Killer Bee's?! Wh-What is it, Senpai?! - Let's go!
- Yes, sir! Th-That's...! Lord Killer Bee... Why has he transformed into
the Eight-Tails?! And after all that lecturing
from Lord Raikage... Look closely!
He's battling someone! Those robes... Are they the Akatsuki? The ones who kidnapped Yugito? Suigetsu is wasted... Damn it! We can't get away... What'll we do?! Here, Sasuke.
Hurry up and bite me! I won't let you die... You're a memento of Kimimaro. I'll take over from here!
Run while you can! He's coming! Amaterasu! S-So those are the inextinguishable
black flames Sasuke spoke of! A-Awesome! Karin, run! Damn! The black flames! It's too late for Karin. We need to get away before
we get caught too! - Wait, Jugo.
- No! Karin! Wh-What? Jugo! Get Karin! Hurry! The black flames are extinguished... What's going on, Sasuke? I was able to extinguish
the black flames of Amaterasu. Are these the visual powers
of my Mangekyo Sharingan?! In which case... The Eight-Tails...
It seems he's barely alive. Then...we managed to take down
the Eight-Tails without killing him. Let's grab him and go. No way...
Lord Killer Bee has been defeated? I-It must be some mistake... Shall we rescue him? They're Akatsuki members.
Don't be hasty. Huh?! That's... What is it?! The Uchiha crest! Uchiha? Rather than taking action ourselves,
we'd better get word to Lord Raikage! If he hears what happened
to his younger brother... Knowing Lord Raikage,
he won't be pleased at all. You seem quite affected, physically. Especially since, in addition to
losing Orochimaru's curse mark, you haven't quite healed from
your battle against Itachi. Yeah... Though I really didn't expect
we'd have such a fight on our hands. But now... I've been waiting for you all.

 Lady Katsuyu!
What are you doing here?

 It's an emergency.

 The barrier to Mount Katsuragi
has been broken!

 What?! Of the Tsuchigumo clan?

 Time is of essence.

 Under the secret treaty made
by the Third Hokage,

 Team Seven will immediately
head out to the location

 with Yamato as team captain.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Wanderer"

 It's an all-new mission! Tune in again!              

 That seat is reserved for me... Sir Utakata! Tonbei is looking for you. I'm counting on you. Not again. They sure went through
a lot of trouble setting up this many traps on
such an open field. Someone is breaking through our traps
and approaching our fort. Just in case, in accordance with
the late master's instructions, I have alerted the Hidden Leaf. It's impossible for any ordinary person
to get close to our fort. However, if the enemy does succeed
in getting here... The three of us, including Sir Utakata,
just have to fight together! We'll turn the tables on them! Why are they targeting us?
What is their purpose? Most likely... the Forbidden Jutsu that has been
passed down to our clan. All these traps,
then as you near the fort, there's a deep ravine... On top of which is
a barrier beyond that. Talk about being overly cautious. Don't you think so, Nango? Yeah... You're just not a man of many words...
are you? Chushin, enough of your rambling. A loose mouth is indicative of
an empty brain. I'd say you're the one who looks bad
each time you open your mouth. Benten... Going through the extremes to
protect something is proof of its value! Get into your positions. That must be it... What?! The barrier has been broken. These guys...are not ordinary people. Benten! Leave them to me! Next is mountain climbing. Lady Hotaru, take this... In order to protect the Forbidden Jutsu
that your grandfather passed down, you and Sir Utakata must escape
to our hidden village. What about you? I will follow immediately.
Now you must hurry... No! If we're to escape,
the three of us will go together. The enemy is at our doorstep. This is not the time for
self-indulgence. You're not coming? Go, Lady Hotaru. Sir Utakata! Please...take care of Lady Hotaru. The debt I owe you will be repaid... Phew, that was close. This isn't gonna be
an ordinary climb, Akaboshi. I can't wait to see what's waiting
for us at the summit. Lady Hotaru... Please be extremely careful
while traveling. You must not leave Sir Utakata's side. Tonbei, you must follow us later.
Promise me that! Lady Hotaru, think only of
your own safety. Nothing else! Lord En no Gyoja... I promise to buy
as much time as possible... So I can protect Lady Hotaru! Lady Tsunade, we received this... What?! Lady Katsuyu! Oh, Kakashi... What? Lady Katsuyu came
all the way to greet us? No, she didn't. There must be trouble. Because... Lady Tsunade only uses
Lady Katsuyu during emergencies. I get it! So there's an urgent situation. I know how you feel, Shino... When you aren't allowed to finish
what you wanted to say... A secret treaty? During the Third Great Ninja War,
a certain jutsu passed down by En no Gyoja, the leader
of the Tsuchigumo Clan, wiped out an entire village. The Third Hokage demanded that
such a dangerous jutsu be classified as a Forbidden Jutsu. And in exchange, it was agreed that
the Hidden Leaf would provide aid to the Tsuchigumo clan
in time of danger. Kakashi, you are to report to the village
for details from your last mission. Understood. We're battling against time. Team 7 will go with Captain Yamato and head for
Mount Katsuragi immediately. Yes, sir! Why aren't you coming,
Kakashi Sensei? Is there a problem if it's just me? That's not what I meant... En no Gyoja passed away a year ago
and the fort on Mount Katsuragi is occupied by his granddaughter,
Hotaru, and her servant. Whoever is attacking the fort
is undoubtedly after En no Gyoja's Forbidden Jutsu. We must prevent the theft of
the Forbidden Jutsu at all cost. Why did you send Naruto too? It's a countermeasure against
the Akatsuki. Did this old man intend to
protect the fort all by himself? Still, this took longer than planned. Let's hurry and start the search. That's the Tsuchigumo clan's fort?! Captain Yamato! Hm? What happened here? It doesn't look like this is from a fight... Sai, how about it? There are fresh footprints headed
towards the fort... The enemy is a group of four. These are from traps surrounding
the fort. It looks like the enemy avoided them. Then there are more in this area? We'll just follow the trail of trap marks. I get it! That way, we'll get to the fort
without encountering any fresh traps! Where is the Forbidden Jutsu
of En no Gyoja?! You lost, so 'fess up. I know nothing. Playing dumb is useless! The granddaughter. That's right. En no Gyoja
has a granddaughter. Did you let her escape? She has the Forbidden Jutsu? Is that it? Hey! Enough. I know where to find her. We're out of time.
It seems we have some interference. It's a dead-end, Captain Yamato. We'll just lay a bridge across it. Wood Style! Gotta hand it to you, Captain Yamato! Aren't you glad I was here? Don't rub it in. Hang on, old man! It's weak, but he still has a pulse.
He'll live. We were one step too late... Sai, check the area to see
if there are any others. Right. You've come to... We are from the Hidden Leaf and were dispatched to
provide assistance. You are Lady Hotaru's servant,
I presume? I am...Tonbei... L-Lady Hotaru is headed for the hidden village of
the Tsuchigumo clan. There is an escape route with
a collapsed entry in the back of the mansion. Lady Hotaru went...through there... I understand. We will follow her. Sakura, stay here and tend
to Sir Tonbei's injuries. Right. Naruto, Sai, let's go. Sir Utakata, there's something
I'd like to ask you... Will you teach me jutsu even
after we get to the hidden village? I don't recall teaching you anything. But back at the fort,
you trained me in many things. You did that on your own... Also, when we reach the village,
I will no longer be needed. There's no one stronger than you
in the village! And I want you to teach me.
That time, when you saved me... Persistent guys... What is...that jutsu?
It's amazing! Now they know my location... For the time being,
I must stay out of view as I move. Are you all right?! That wound... Allow me to treat it back at our fort. That's the least I can do
for coming to my aid. Fort? Please hang on! I'm going to get help.
Don't move from this spot! - Damn! I used too much chakra.
- I'll be right back... At that time, I wanted to become
like you, Sir Utakata! I didn't save you that time... But...! The ninja who attacked were coming
after me, not you. I just fought in order to protect myself. Even so, after watching you, I knew I wanted to be strong
like you. No, I must. That is why I wish to learn your jutsu... Being strong is enough for you? Huh? You may end up regretting being taught
by one who is a wanted man. I trust you, Sir Utakata. No matter what happens,
I will always consider you my master. Don't call me your master! Shoot! Step away from that girl! A Shadow Clone? What a bother... Give it up and be captured--! No! He is not an enemy! Naruto! Pardon him for jumping to conclusions. Sir Tonbei had told us only
about Lady Hotaru... Tonbei is alive and well? Yes. He's under the care
of our medic. I'm glad... From here on, you have
our protection as well. Hey, I'm really sorry. I can leave the rest to you then... Huh? Sure thing!
I always fulfill my missions... Huh? Thanks... Take care. Sir Utakata! Hey, where're you going? Can't you at least stay with me until
we reach the hidden village? Those guys are strong...
You can rely on them. I don't need guards!
I need someone to teach me jutsu! Come with me, please... I'll be more serious than ever
in my training! I'll endure anything and
I promise never to cry! And... And I'll never call you
my master...ever...again... Stupid Master Utakata! I told you not to call me that... I'm not foolish enough to
be called master. Why are you people following me?

 We're your bodyguards, that's why!

 There is no need for that.
I can protect myself just fine.

 You Hidden Leaf people may leave.

 Don't ask such nonsense!

 Oh well then. Let's do as she says
and leave.

 What?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Successor of the Forbidden Jutsu"

 Now, now, don't worry. YAMATO'S ROOM




Among his comrades,
he's the only one who remains a genin. Our guest today is Naruto Uzumaki. That was a deflating introduction. That's what it says in the script. So you didn't forget your script today, eh? Are you still gonna bring that up? Well, it happened twice! The last time, Kakashi Senpai had it. Then how about the first time? That script went missing
while I was using the restroom. Then it was found splattered
with ramen soup. Hm? Ramen soup? Heh heh heh.
Ramen during break time! Ahh! Crap! Whose script is this? Oh...what'll I do? What'll I do? I guess I'll just have to get rid
of the evidence! All right, done! We're on air! Yeah, be right there. That was...yours, Captain Yamato?! It was you... I knew it! Yikes! Tune in again!

 So...the girl has bodyguards now... I never imagined
the Hidden Leaf's bodyguards would reach her so quickly. But even so,
there are only four of them. I say we get rid of them all and take the Forbidden Jutsu
from the girl, Boss. Don't be so impatient. Then, what's the plan? That Forbidden Jutsu is worth
more than money to us. We can't afford to fail. That Jutsu displayed unbelievable power
during the last great war. If we steal it, all of us could go from
a motley band of thieves to lords of our own domains. But... The Hidden Leaf people... Could the Forbidden Jutsu
have fallen into their hands? Very unlikely. The previous Hokage and En no Gyoja
forged a secret treaty to protect the Forbidden Jutsu
at all cost. The Hidden Leaf is
only fulfilling that promise. But...if they're the vanguards
of that treaty, then those bodyguards
must be skilled fighters. Yeah...and reinforcements
are sure to come! Nango! Benten! Have you guys lost your nerve
before the fight even begins?! Seems it's not just your face, but your head's bad, too. What'd you say?! Consider all the possibilities and
use what you've got up here. Stop fighting amongst yourselves. Have you forgotten? We're a team. We can't afford to lose even one of us. And it's our unity and
Combination Jutsu that helped us live through
chaotic times. Yeah, fine... There's no need to rush. I already know what
their destination is. They're headed for the Hidden Village
of the Tsuchigumo Clan. The Hidden Leaf will leave
on their own once they arrive at the destination. But won't it be trouble if they manage to enter
the hidden village? Akaboshi. Seems you still
don't understand humans. To us, that Forbidden Jutsu
is a treasure, but to normal people,
it's nothing but a nuisance. Successor of
the Forbidden Jutsu

 What'd you do that for?! That's what I want to ask you! Why are you following me?! Why? I'm your bodyguard,
that's why! I'll say it again.
I don't need a bodyguard. I can protect myself just fine. You Hidden Leaf people
may leave now! We can't just say,
"Oh, is that so?" and leave. Why not?!
Really, please don't bother with me. We're not bothering you,
we're just guarding! Naruto, let's do as she says
and leave. How come?! We have no choice. W-Wait here for a sec. Are you sure?
The enemy could still be close by. Now, now, don't worry. Hey! I get it. Well then, we'll be leaving. Fine. No! No! Get it off! Get it off of me! There. Wh-What was that thing? A mountain leech.
There are a lot of them around here, so it's not unusual for them
to rain down on you. Rain down? Yeah. See you!
Be careful on your way. All by...yourself! What'd you step on it for? Naruto, please stay by me... I can't touch something like that.
I just can't. Absolutely impossible. If leeches rain down on me, I want you to block them, Naruto. But you said you didn't need
a bodyguard. Just until we clear this forest! Hmm... What should I do? Please, Naruto! I suppose I could... But now that I think about it, Sir Utakata would still be
my bodyguard if you all hadn't shown up. Utakata... The guy who uses
that weird jutsu? He is my master. I want to become
strong like Sir Utakata. Hmm... Your master, eh? There's no such thing as
a good master. Take my master, for example... He's a perv and a scatterbrain... And on top of that,
he gets carried away a lot. But well...as a ninja,
he's very strong, dependable, and above all, kind. Guess you can't judge a person
by their appearance. If I could, I wouldn't mind becoming
a ninja like him some day. You like your master, too,
don't you, Naruto? Like him? Who could like
an old pervert like him? I, too, want to be strong
like Sir Utakata. If I become strong, I can master the jutsu
Grandfather bequeathed to me. If I do that... I could even restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan. For someone so young, it looks like you're carrying
some heavy responsibilities. By the way, where could
your master have gone off to? I don't know. For some reason,
when I call Sir Utakata "master," he gets very upset. Sai! What's with the numbers?! You can stop with the leeches now. Hmm... Does he mean
he wants bigger ones? Huh? No? Then... For crying out loud.
Enough is enough... Huh?! What're you doing, stupid Sai! Get a clue from my gestures! Come on, you guys... Now I can go back to
my drifting life style... She should be okay
if she's with him. But...that chakra... Nah, can't be. Excuse me... You need to be treated immediately. Come to our fort... Looks like no one's coming after me... My wounds have also healed...
Guess it's time to... Please take me as your student! After seeing your fight
the other day, I have nothing
but respect for you, master! Master? Yes, Master Utakata! Don't ever call me that again... Huh? But... Don't you ever call me master again! I have no intention of taking
a student. Sir...Utakata... But that would be forgetting
your debt to me for accepting my hospitality. Is it okay to eat free meals
and drink free sake?! So, what would you like
on today's menu of free food?! You sure hit where it hurts. Tonbei taught me to say that if you refused to take me
as your student... So that old man was in
on this, too, eh? Look here, you haven't had
any training at all... If you're talking about ninjutsu, I have received some training
from Tonbei. Then why don't you study
with the old man? It wasn't enough...
That's why I'm asking you! Okay, then,
try walking on that pond. On the pond... All right! Good grief. At this rate, she won't be able
to do it before I leave. Sir Utakata! Sir Utakata! See? Look, Sir Utakata! You...practiced all night? Yes. So now will you make me
your student? N-No. This is just the first step... Next is this jutsu. Water Style: Raging Waves! Amazing! If you can't even do this,
you can't be my student. All right! Water Style: Raging Waves! Huh? Water Style: Raging Waves! Huh? Why doesn't it work? This jutsu cannot be done unless you possess
the Water Style Chakra. Don't take it personally... Huh? Rain? Sir Utakata! Whoa! You're too close! Please watch this! Water Style: Raging Waves! Will you make me your student now?! Ugh...no...I... N-Not yet... W-Wait, Sir Utakata! I figured you'd be coming to
see me about now. Come on, give me a break. What was the big idea,
putting that kid up to that? I have a big favor. Would you stay here and
protect Lady Hotaru? That's...quite a troublesome thing
to ask in return. Lady Hotaru is...a child of destiny. Judging by the way
you defeated the thieves, I know you are a person
of extraordinary skills. And above all, you lack greed. As you can see, I am already
advanced in years. If she becomes your student,
Lady Hotaru's life will be safe. Won't you please
do me this favor? I'm sorry, but that won't be possible. I'm sure you must've noticed it.
I'm being pursued. Death gathers all around me. How could you even think of leaving
that child with me? I see. And besides, the relationship between
a master and student... is not something you can count on. Master! What're you
trying to do, Master! M-Master?! I must've dozed off... Do you really think we can be lords
of our own domain? Damn right! Isn't that right, Akaboshi? Yeah. Even if we sold it off, we'd still get enough money to live
the rest of our lives in leisure! Hey, what's wrong? Be on guard!
There's someone nearby. There! What the--?! There! Damn! What's going on?! Who the hell are you?! He doesn't seem to be one of
the Hidden Leaf's reinforcements... You don't think this guy's after
the Forbidden Jutsu as well? Oh... The fact that you know about
the Forbidden Jutsu means... You guys are the band of thieves? Makes me wonder, though. Is it that awesome?
That Forbidden Jutsu? If that's the case,
I think I want that Forbidden Jutsu, too. What? Are you planning
to grab it from us? So? What should we do? Go ahead and kill him! After him! What is this slime? I've been blinded! Spread out! We'll surround him! This chakra flow... Their movements have become faster
all of a sudden. Barrier jutsu?! Let's go! Damn! It's over! How far do you intend to follow me? How far? You're the one who said
until we clear the forest. I did say that, but... Thing is, there's only forest between the fort and the hidden village! You people, too? Looks like we'll complete our assignment
without incident. Oh! We reached the village! What? No one here? Hello! Is anyone...anybody here? Sai. Yes... Hey! Hotaru is back! Isn't anyone here?! Hmm... Okay! Hold on a sec! Oh, Naruto! Good grief... Emergency! Fire! There's a fire! Oh, so you were here. Sorry to startle all of you! But you all wouldn't come on out. Hotaru is back after being away
a long time! You should welcome her! What? What's the matter
with all of you? Hotaru! Uncle... Thank you for all you've done. I am responsible for this village. I heard from Lord En no Gyoja about what to do if worse
came to worst. Please leave the rest to us. All right then, we will be on our way. Uh, no, just a moment. We haven't had a chance
to thank you. - At least allow us to...
-We appreciate your thoughtfulness. However, we left our teammate back
at Mount Katsuragi. I see... That's too bad. Come on, let's return to Sakura. Oh, okay... Naruto. I... You'll be fine. Thank you. What's the matter, Naruto? Sorry, Captain Yamato. Would you mind going on ahead
without me? I'm returning to that village. Return? Something keeps...bothering me. I can't help but think about
the way those villagers looked at her. Wait, Naruto! I can't leave her there alone! What do you mean
Hotaru is gone?!

 - Naruto, don't.
- But...

 Something might have happened
to one of their people,

 so why aren't they looking?!

 There is no point in arguing here.

 In any case, finding her
is our top priority.

 - Sai.
- Understood.

 I will scout around right away.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Successor's Wish" Just hold tight.
We'll find you! Tune in again!

 Naruto. I... You'll be fine. Thank you. What's the matter, Naruto? Sorry, Captain Yamato. Would you mind going on ahead
without me? I'm returning to that village. Return? Something keeps...bothering me. I can't help but think about
the way those villagers looked at her. Wait, Naruto! Damn, I have a bad feeling
about this. You must be exhausted after
your long journey, Hotaru. Come... Umm... Follow me. What is the Chief thinking? Does he really intend to
shelter her here? You've got to be kidding. If something happens, we'll get-- Hush! You talk too much. Should I have not come back? Of course not. You're finally home. You must get some rest. Thank you. Well then... We finally meet the granddaughter
of En no Gyoja. Who's there?! We knew you would rely
on this village. You're the ones who attacked the fort! Someone, help! Bandits! Uncle, please open the door! Uncle! Somebody! It's useless. Now, hand over the Forbidden Jutsu. No! Don't give us trouble! Hey, hey... Be more gentle
when handling a lady. You should talk. Bro. So this is the hidden jutsu in question... So it was rigged, eh? Sassy kid... After her! Don't let her get away. To think they had already
taken steps in the Tsuchigumo village... I have to get away from here. So she ran into the forest... Found you, girlie. Water Style: Raging Waves! Don't let a petty jutsu like that
bring you down, Chushin. Shut up! She just caught me
by surprise, is all. Playtime is over. Tell me. Where is the Forbidden Jutsu? What a pain. I'd talk now if I were you. Benten might look like a girl,
but he's scary when he's mad. I won't talk! That is my people's last hope. Geez... This is getting ridiculous. If you don't want to talk,
I'll help you get into the mood. Don't kill her. That's all up to her. What?! What's all this racket?
Can't a guy even take a nap? Sir Utakata! You! You're still alive? We got you back there for sure! Well, sorry to disappoint you. It's not like I wanna fight you guys... But I have business with her too. The Successor's Wish

 What? She's gone?! What's up with that?! I'm not sure myself.
This is where I hid Hotaru. Then there was a loud noise
and when I rushed over, she was... All right. I'll help you find her. Tell me where you've searched already. Well, um... We haven't started
the search yet. What?! Why didn't you search
for her immediately? Judging by the damage,
it's obvious something happened! Yes...but... What's wrong with you?!
Isn't she one of your people?! Enough, Naruto. Yelling won't help. Captain Yamato.
What are you doing here? We were also worried,
so we rushed back. It seems we were right. When did you last see her? Just a while ago. After you brought Hotaru here,
I showed her to this room. Then not much time has passed. Let's hurry, Naruto. But... Her safety is our main concern
right now. Sir Utakata, you came to save me! That's not quite the case,
but we'd better do something here. What's with this guy? I thought our jutsu hit him that time. Are you scheming to steal
our treasure away from us? I won't let you. Acid Flower! Nango, come back! Oh... It missed. Why you--! Surround him!
We'll bring him down this time. He's outside our formation! So long. Not so fast! Sir Utakata! He's fast. They can't have gone far.
Let's go after them. Forget it. Boss. Why? Are you just gonna let
our treasure get away? This is the Mist's Bingo Book. We've stumbled across
a very interesting guy. Meaning his head's worth enough
to be in this book? Wow... 50 million ryo. We're in luck. The girl's jutsu is worth a fortune,
and now this. We'll be rolling in money. But with a bounty this high,
he's bound to be a formidable foe. Hah! Don't get cold feet now!
This is our big chance. What? I'm just... Hey! Pipe down.
So what'll we do, Boss? Let's see... It's my fault. I... I should've returned right away. Can I ask you a question? Our mission was to protect the girl until she reached
Tsuchigumo village safely, right? That was supposed to be it. But if we can't completely guarantee
that she's safe, the mission had no meaning. This mission is based on a treaty
which was drawn up by the Third Hokage and En no Gyoja
of the Tsuchigumo Clan. So if the current Tsuchigumo Clan
cannot protect her, then it's our job to do so. Sai, can you scan the entire area
and search for her? Understood. Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll. Hold on...
We'll find you for sure! Sir Utakata, where are we? Wow... So high! This should be good. I thought I was done for. You are amazing, after all. Don't get me wrong.
I didn't mean to save you. Then why did you come? Well... Let's just say
I became curious about this Forbidden Jutsu
those guys seem to want so badly. You're lying. You're not like that. Never can tell.
There's not a person in the world who doesn't love
the smell of money. Don't pretend to be a villain. You have a knack for putting me
off balance. But what will you do now? Those guys aren't the only ones
who'll target that jutsu. Others are bound to turn up. You're right. That's why I must get stronger. That's why I want to become
your stu-- Stop right there. I'm not listening. Besides, this keepsake of
your grandfather or whatever... Why are you so determined to protect it? Well... It's to honor the wishes
of my master. Grandfather was also my first master. A master and student must
be one in thought. That's why I want to fulfill the dream
that my grandfather could not. In order to restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan, I cannot lose this jutsu. Hmph... One in thought? Such a stupid delusion. Where are you going? I'm under no obligation
to stick around. If you wanna play master and student,
go somewhere else. It's not play!
I'm serious about you! I want to call you my master! You can't stop me, you know. I know that.
But my feelings won't change. That is why... Huh?! I-Idiot! What're you doing?! I want you to see me... Everything about me. Hotaru...you... How could they? No one knows about this... But I didn't want to hide it from you. Please, Sir Utakata... - I...
- Don't say it! Damn it! Hidden Jutsu: Kirisame. Shoot! As I thought...
This rain is Kirisame... Utakata. There is no escape for you now. What's going on? We cannot keep the village
waiting any longer. You guys sure are persistent.
Stay back, Hotaru. Water Style: Water Whip! Hotaru! I'll say it once more.
Cease resisting and come with us. If you try anything, this girl will die. Sir Utakata... Let me make it clear that
she is nothing to me. I couldn't care less what happens. I see. We'll see about that. I see that worked.
Now return to the village with us. No matter how many times you ask,
the answer will be the same. Then we have no choice. Lightning Style: Earth Flash! Sir Utakata! Don't take this personally. We absolutely must take him
back to our village. Such cruelty... Please stop. This isn't enough to kill him. I'm just restricting a little of
his strength. Stop it! Just what did Sir Utakata
do anyway?! Utakata is a heinous criminal
who killed his master and escaped from the village. We need to tie him up. Get started. - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! Rasengan! What?! What's going on? You guys are pretty rotten,
taking a hostage. Naruto! Sorry to keep you waiting! Let her go, bastards!

 Wait, Naruto.

 Why are you stopping me?!

 Those masks...
They're Tracking Ninjas.

 They're not after Hotaru.
It's Utakata.

 He's a Rogue Ninja listed in
the Hidden Mist's Bingo Book.

 What?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Rogue Ninja's Past"

 What's his story? Man, did I eat! Winters are made for hotpots! The Chinese cabbage tasted great. Okay... Time for ramen. Huh? Huh?! A cockroach! There! What're you doing?! Every living creature has a soul. Don't kill recklessly. Besides, it appeared because
this room isn't clean, and that's the owner's fault. Uh... But we can't just let it run around. True... They say that wherever there's one,
there's a hundred more somewhere. Fine. I'll handle this then. I'm going to use
my Beetle-Summoning Hidden Jutsu and return them to the forest. Okay, then get right to it! Fine. Hidden Jutsu! Beetle-Summoning! Tune in again!

 You people... Are you all right? Yeah... But why are you here? You were also worried about Hotaru? Yeah right. It was just
sheer coincidence. But...these guys didn't come here
for Hotaru. What do you mean? And who are these guys? That mask... I see... So they're target is... Master! Why are the Hidden Leaf here? Please let that girl go. No! In that case! We'll take her back... by force! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Ninja Art! Super Beast Scroll! I'll take the one in the middle. You take the ones around him.
We'll attack together. Got it. But...these Black Ops are... Let's see how it goes for
a bit longer... We need to find out what
their purpose is. Master... Hidden Jutsu: Kirisame! What's with this rain?! It's a jutsu that eats away the chakra
it comes into contact with. It's called the Kirisame Jutsu! Why you...! Go! Stop! Don't be hasty! Let's go! Water Whip! Wood Style! Master! I need you to stay quiet
for a while. What the hell are you doing?! Naruto! Wait. We are on a mission to guard
that girl. Please return her to us. Yeah! Give her back, you! You are Anbu Black Ops
from the Hidden Mist, and the one you seek
is this man, correct? Huh? Anbu Black Ops...
from the Hidden Mist? I get it now... So that means he is a... Utakata is a Rogue Ninja from
the Hidden Mist and is listed in the Bingo Book. These men have come after him. So these guys...
aren't ninjas who are after her? They're after Utakata? She has nothing to do with you.
Please release her. Then we'll exchange her for him. No. That, we can't do. What?! That girl seems to be very fond
of this man. If we hand him over to you,
no doubt, she will pursue you. Then we'll be in trouble. So we can't turn him over. Then...neither can we... If we resort to force, it may have major effects
beyond this village, and erupt into a full-scale war. Are you willing to go that far? The Hidden Mist? Captain Yamato. Men of the Hidden Leaf... I command this unit from
behind the scenes. I am Tsurugi, head of
the Hidden Mist Anbu Black Ops. It is certainly not our desire
to escalate this into a war between nations. Certainly, we can still negotiate? Yes, I agree. You're... Let us meet. Just you and I... And Utakata. Understood. You two stay here. "Rogue Ninja's Past"

 Then until you complete
your mission, we will postpone
apprehending Utakata. As soon as her safety
is guaranteed, I will notify you. Please keep in mind that should
you go back on our agreement, war between our nations
may be inevitable. I understand. Hmm... You guys are too much.
I'll be doing things as I please. Not likely. Until our mission is over,
you will remain with us. After that, it's all between you
and the Hidden Mist. Fine. Tell me... Just what did you do
in Hidden Mist Village? That...is none of your business. My apologies. I want to speak to him alone. I'll wait over there. Captain Yamato! How did your talk go? Oh, it went well. Where are those two? Having a discussion. Is it true...
that Utakata is a Rogue Ninja? Yeah... Don't give us trouble.
Return to the Hidden Mist. Humph! No thanks! Why would I go back
just to get killed...? The village has changed. We no longer have the practices
that once gave us the nickname, "Blood Mist Village." But while things may seem peaceful, it is a delicate power balance
between the Five Great Nations. The importance of what you possess
increases each year, and research into its use
has also been stepped up. The village needs that power,
so you certainly won't be killed. I don't trust anyone anymore. Master... Please stop, Master! My master...tried to kill me... along with that thing inside me. I sacrificed myself for the sake
of the village. I trusted my master's words...
and did as he bid. And he betrayed my trust... he tried to kill me! What?! Th-This...power... Wait! Stop! Stop! No, Utakata! He didn't... Harusame didn't try to kill you. It wasn't like that. That cursed deed he performed on you... He was trying to separate it
from you. He was trying to save you. Like I'd believe such a story... You've grown senile. I speak the truth... My master... No, that man used me
and tried to kill me. And in the aftermath...he died. If you ask the villagers,
they will say I killed him. Utakata... Return to the village. Then you will know that
I am not lying. No thanks. Then, we have no choice
but to kill you. As you please. And I will do as I please. Master! Let her go. Yes, sir! Master! Enough! Never call me that again. Understand? Men of the Hidden Leaf, as agreed,
we will retreat for now. Let us pray that both our missions
are successful. However, we will continue to
keep watch over you. Understood. Farewell. Scatter! Oh dear... Now then, where do
we go from here? It's best that we don't return
to the Tsuchigumo village. Yes, you're right. If it's no longer secure as
a ninja village, her safety is questionable. Then it may be better to return
to Mount Katsuragi and rethink our stance. I also wish to go back. I want to make sure Tonbei
is all right. Although, the ones after
the Forbidden Jutsu may also go back to Katsuragi,
so it may not be safe either. Let's join up with
Tonbei and Sakura, then decide on our course of action. Utakata, you too. Are you all right? Uh-huh... I wonder why he doesn't want me
to call him "Master." Utakata is a heinous criminal
who killed his master and escaped from the village. Just what happened between...
Sir Utakata and his master? We don't know what
the relationship is between Utakata and
the Hidden Mist. But that's not important. If you've already decided
you want to be his student, then who cares? It matters.
I want to become strong. In order to restore my clan's honor. That's why I want to
learn from him. I can tell. You want him to
teach you hands on, right? It's not like that... Well, I felt the same way too. I don't have any memories
of my parents. Huh? So maybe that's why...
when I traveled with the Pervy Sage... I wondered if that's what
it felt like to have a parent. And I acted spoiled
with him sometimes. But training isn't that easy. You have to think things
through yourself, and learn the technique by yourself. Otherwise, you'll never get better. If the Pervy Sage hadn't been there, I wouldn't even have realized
something that basic. We're not alone... Just the thought that
someone is nearby, watching over us... that alone makes us strong. I understand how you feel.
I envy you, Naruto. Just like you, I'm going to think of
Sir Utakata as my master and... Hey...you look pale... I'm...okay... Hey! You're burning up... You're hurt! Is it from that fight?! Captain Yamato! I'll see to her. Can you go and get some
medicinal herbs? The dokudami plant should
be abundant around here in the moist areas. It has heart-shaped leaves
which are purple underneath. The leaves are purple underneath, right? Yes. All right! What's wrong? Hotaru is injured... Let us be. All right... Moist areas... I guess I should search
by the riverbank! There! That's gotta be it. Huh? What the hell?!
This is a chameleon plant! Aw man, there were lots
of 'em along the way! Damn it! I wasted so much time! What the...? What the hell is this...? The Forbidden Jutsu of
the Tsuchigumo Clan It was engraved...
into this child's very own body. How could they do such a thing? To hell with Forbidden Jutsu...
To hell with the clan... To hell with one's master! And all these selfish guys who
do atrocious things to those who serve them
without a hint of remorse. They think of us...as mere tools. Tools...who don't speak. Hotaru... What is this, Tonbei?

 So En no Gyoja left behind
a way to extract the Forbidden Jutsu.

 It is evident that our clan
no longer has the strength

 to safeguard the Forbidden Jutsu.

 To prevent its misuse,

 we have no choice
but to destroy the jutsu.

 Destroy it?
What'll happen to Hotaru then?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Heir to Darkness"

 Damn it! Isn't there
another way?! I see... So sometimes, a hand-made present
is very effective. Hey, Sai! Hi. Has something come up?
Calling me out of the blue like this. It's nothing really... Then don't call me. But I drew this for you.
Will you accept it? Huh?! Don't you like it? No, it's not that...
Well, actually it is... But guess I'll take it if you insist. He made it for me,
so I'll hang it up somewhere. Huh? Wh-What is this?! Hey! Hey! Cut it out, will ya?! That Sai...
He's done it this time! I wonder if Naruto liked it? Tune in again!

 Say, that boy... He's the one. The only one
who failed to make it! Humph! Good for him! It would be terrible if someone
like him became a ninja. I mean that boy is actually... Don't say another word.
It's taboo. Damn! What's with all this?! Heir to Darkness

 Good thing I took extra measures,
just in case. They haven't returned yet. Naruto? Why you...! Wait, Naruto! Stop! No, Captain Yamato!
Let me just say this! Old man Tonbei! You knew the Forbidden Jutsu
was embedded into Hotaru's back, didn't you?! Answer me! The Forbidden Jutsu is in that girl? Friends of the Hidden Leaf... Please stop!
It was my grandfather. You served Hotaru's grandfather
all through the years, didn't you? So why didn't you stop him?! Please stop, Naruto! No, I won't stop! Because of that...
Because of that, you're... I asked that it be done! What did you say? I...I asked for the Forbidden Jutsu! Lady Hotaru... Hotaru... Why do such a thing? Tonbei... I'm glad you're all right. I should say that about you,
Lady Hotaru. Friends of the Hidden Leaf...
Sir Utakata... I am beholden to you
for all you have done for us. Don't mention it. But the Tsuchigumo Village was already
under the bandit's control. I see... And that is why
you returned here... Yes. Never mind that. Tell us the rest of what
you were saying earlier! About the Forbidden Jutsu? Yeah. It was Grandfather's dream. En no Gyoja's...? The Tsuchigumo Clan was once
hailed as a proud clan. By possessing
a powerful Forbidden Jutsu, we were said to even be able to tilt
the balance of the Great Ninja War. But at the same time, our clan was targeted often
because of the Forbidden Jutsu. And one life after another was lost. When the Great War was over, only a few remained who could
wield the Forbidden Jutsu. Furthermore, Lord En no Gyoja and the village elder had disagreements
over the clan's survival. This led to the clan splitting
into two groups with one in
the Tsuchigumo Village and the other at Mount Katsuragi. However, Lord En no Gyoja was
already quite advanced in years and few opted to follow him
to Mount Katsuragi. Hotaru...I'm counting on you. The future of the Tsuchigumo Clan... Grandfather! Grandfather believed that
protecting the Tsuchigumo name was the way to make amends and honor those who lost their lives
for the Forbidden Jutsu. That is why I want to carry
on the wish of my grandfather, who was my master. How stupid. Just for that you had the Forbidden Jutsu
embedded in your body? For your master, for your clan...
It's all so stupid. Even so, it's a student's duty
to carry out the wishes of her master! Hotaru... You wouldn't understand...
Master Utakata...how I feel. Lady Hotaru,
perhaps Sir Utakata is right. Tonbei? It is evident that the Tsuchigumo Clan no longer
has the strength to safeguard the Forbidden Jutsu. If we allowed the misuse
of the Forbidden Jutsu, Lord En no Gyoja would
surely turn in his grave. To prevent its misuse, we have no choice
but to destroy the jutsu. Destroy? And how would you do that?! The Forbidden Jutsu is
inside Hotaru's body! You don't mean...! Don't get me wrong. Mr. Tonbei...
You mustn't move too much. Do not be concerned. What is this? Lord En no Gyoja entrusted me
with that scroll. It contains the way to
remove the Forbidden Jutsu from Lady Hotaru's body. Is there such a method? Lord En no Gyoja would never have
embedded the Forbidden Jutsu into Lady Hotaru without
a way to remove it. What kind of master would
even think of such a thing? Please forgive me. I should have advised you sooner. Once it is removed from your body, the Forbidden Jutsu will
no longer have any power. I also longed to restore
the clan's former glory. Without the Forbidden Jutsu,
that dream would fade. But this is how it should be. You can't be serious! Friends of the Hidden Leaf... Please help me remove
the Forbidden Jutsu from Lady Hotaru. However, we cannot make
such decisions on our own. Then hurry up and get
Granny Tsunade's permission. We can't just leave Hotaru like this! Please wait! I haven't decided to let go
of the Forbidden Jutsu yet! But Lady Hotaru... Not only the Forbidden Jutsu, but also your life would be in peril! It's my life! Come to your senses! Sir Utakata... I-I'm sorry. Are you telling me to abandon
my clan pride and honor?! Hey, wait! Naruto! I'll bring her back! Lady Hotaru... I'll go and convince her. Hold on, please! We cannot let you move around. She can't have gone far.
I'll be right back. I won't put Hotaru in danger. All right. Sakura, go with him! Yes, sir. I'd be better at scouting her out. There's something I want you
to do right now. Yes, sir. Grandfather... Hotaru...take a look. Once, the Tsuchigumo clan was
known far beyond those mountains, and all one could see from here
was part of our lands. Our clan was so grand, wasn't it? Are you crying? Grandfather... Was I wrong? If I had not been the leader,
would the Tsuchigumo Clan...? So your grandfather's grave is here? I picked those near by. Thank you, Naruto. With a view like this, your grandpa must be very happy
to be buried here. I'm sure he's worried about you. He's right. Let's go back, Hotaru. Sir Utakata. Well? Let's go. But I... If you truly wish to restore
your clan's glory, you don't need to rely
on such a thing. Having too much power only
gives rise to suffering. I'm the prime example... Right, Naruto? Huh? There's still one other way. Another way? There is someone named Shiranami
among the Tsuchigumo Clan... who is able to use
the Forbidden Jutsu. Who's Shiranami? He is grandfather's student. En no Gyoja's student? Well, more correctly,
he is the student's student. Sir Shiranami's father, Sir Hato,
was my grandfather's first student. I have heard that he was brilliant
with exceptional ninjutsu skills. And it was said that his son,
Sir Shiranami, was even more skilled. But during the Great War,
Sir Shiranami's father was killed trying to protect the Forbidden Jutsu. Grandfather sensed that
Sir Shiranami was also in danger and had him flee the village. Grandfather often said that
if those two were here now, this village would not be
in such dire straits. So where is this Shiranami fellow now? You know of anything? Well... There's no telling when
the bandits will return. We have no time to look for Shiranami. Make up your mind, Hotaru. All right then! I'll go and
find this Shiranami! What are you talking about?! Actually...Hotaru... I'm sorta in the same dilemma as you. You too, Naruto? Naruto...that's... I can't go into detail,
but deep down, I've always been troubled by it. Anyway, I can be like this now
because people like Sakura, the Pervy Sage and all the rest
of my friends have stayed by me. But Hotaru, you're awfully strong. You accepted those troubles
and you've suffered all alone. Carrying your clan and
your grandpa's dream on your shoulders. That's why I want you to
fulfill your dream. If this Shiranami fellow is found,
he'll be an ally, right? Then you won't be alone. And you don't have to suffer
by yourself. Naruto... Now don't worry. Just leave it to me, Naruto Uzumaki. Give me one...no, two days. I'll find Shiranami without fail. What a surprise. I never would've guessed my name
would be mentioned here. Is there some kind of trouble? I see... It's pretty much what I imagined. What will you do? It will be dangerous to keep
the Forbidden Jutsu intact. But it says here they want to
keep the Forbidden Jutsu and guard the girl at the Leaf village. Without a doubt, it's necessary
to keep the Forbidden Jutsu from falling into
a third party's possession. Cripes... I acted like finding the guy
was no big deal for me, but where do I start looking? Well, it's no use thinking about it. This calls for the strength
in numbers approach! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto is...? Indeed, if Shiranami returns
to the village, we could... Can he find him in only two days? We may not be able to wait
that long. If the bandits attack again
before Naruto returns... You're right... Just in case, we'll make preparations and stand by to purge
the Forbidden Jutsu. You understand, Hotaru? Yes. It looks like the Diremption Jutsu
requires potions. Sakura, you'll be in charge. Mix the potion and be ready. Understood. Lord En no Gyoja would never
have embedded the Forbidden Jutsu into Lady Hotaru without
a way to remove it. What kind of master would
even think of such a thing? M-Master...?! No, Utakata! He didn't... Harusame didn't try to kill you.
It wasn't like that. Could it be...
that Tsurugi spoke the truth? If so, then what was
Master trying to tell me? I must speak to Tsurugi once more. Say, ever heard of a guy
named Shiranami? Do you know a guy
named Shiranami? I see... Don't know him, huh? Anything you know? If you find out, tell me,
Naruto of the Hidden Leaf! It's no use... I've used up my chakra and I don't even have a clue. What's the matter? Standing in the middle
of the road like this. Well... I'm looking for someone and just can't seem to find him. Hmm... Who might that be? A guy named Shiranami. Shiranami... Oh, there is such a man. No kidding! Is that true?!
Are you sure about this, old man?! Yes. There's a man by that name
who lives in a small hut by the waterfall beyond this mountain,
and does ninja training. Beyond this mountain, right?!
Thanks, old man! Found him! Sir Utakata...
Don't tell me he already left... Come on out, Tsurugi. Tell me what you had to
say one more time. Utakata is on the move. I see...Utakata...
Is he trying to lure me? - Let's go!
- Yes, sir! What?! I finally got a lead!

 This Shiranami of
the Tsuchigumo Clan

 was supposed to be a skilled ninja...

 I'm sure the guy training
in the mountains

 must be the one Hotaru
is looking for!

 Looks like I'll make it within
the time I promised.

 Just sit tight, Hotaru.

 I'll bring him to you right away!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Separation"

 I've been looking for you,
Shiranami! Tune in again!

 Separation

 That must be it. I've finally found you. Hold tight, Hotaru. I'm coming back with
Shiranami right now! Mister...Shiranami? I found you. Are you Shiranami? You fell for it. How could you leave without a word? Sir Utakata, I still... I take it that you are Lady Hotaru
the granddaughter of En no Gyoja? Wh-Who are you?! My name is...Shiranami. Shiranami?! Release! We finally meet, Lady Hotaru. That's... That crest is bestowed only
to those initiated in the use of the Forbidden Jutsu. Can you really be...Sir Shiranami? I don't blame you for being surprised. I came after hearing Naruto's story. Naruto?! Then you really
are Sir Shiranami! Where is Naruto? I must thank him... He's no longer here. He asked me to take care
of the rest, and left. I see... Naruto too... Naruto told me that...
you wanted to revive the clan. Huh? Oh...yes. If you are truly serious, then could you listen to
what I have to say? Sir Shiranami? I'm told Tonbei is alive and well... and that he's planning to use the Diremption Jutsu to destroy
the Forbidden Jutsu. You know Tonbei too? We trained together for a time. However, I am opposed to
Tonbei's intentions. Why? Long ago...my father
was ordered by Lord En no Gyoja to guard the Forbidden Jutsu. My father was a hero who protected
the honor of the Tsuchigumo clan along with the Forbidden Jutsu. That is, until he was killed by one
who was after the Forbidden Jutsu. My father's death motivated
Lord En no Gyoja to move the Forbidden Jutsu to
the fort on Mount Katsuragi, and he let me escape out
of the country. I promised myself that one day, I would return to the village for
the sake of the Tsuchigumo Clan! Sir Shiranami... Lady Hotaru. My father was killed and
I was forced to run away because we were
the only two survivors who knew how to use
the Forbidden Jutsu. He went through the same anguish... But I've become strong
and now I'm back. If we join forces,
we can revive the Forbidden Jutsu! There is no need to destroy
the Forbidden Jutsu! The restoration of the Tsuchigumo Clan
is my dedicated wish too! Let us fulfill the dreams of my father
and Lord En no Gyoja! But... Beyond this mountain is
my secret hideaway. Lady Hotaru! I understand. Hotaru is gone? I searched around the entire fort. I did relay Naruto's message
that he "found Shiranami." She went after Utakata...
Could that be it? All right, we'll postpone
the ritual preparations for now. Finding Hotaru is our top priority. Sai, send out as many
search mice as possible. Let's go. Yes, sir. Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll! Is that for Tonbei? Huh? Oh, yes...
I must let him know. At least a short note to Sir Utakata... Off you go... Let's go, Sir Shiranami. You're making this difficult... What? DESTROY Go. Huh? What's...? If you do as you please...! I thought I had come
to terms with it... So why am I thinking
about my master now? What is that? A word manipulated by chakra? A carrier pigeon? From Hotaru?! To Sir Utakata, I will work to revive the Tsuchigumo Clan
with Sir Shiranami. Thank you for all you have done. Good-bye. From your student, Hotaru. Hotaru... So she met up with Shiranami... That means I'm finally free of her. Who are you guys?! Don't tell me you have Shiranami--! What a simpleton. He's concerned about
Boss Shiranami. If we let you see the girl
with the Forbidden Jutsu, all our plans will be ruined. You're telling too much. No need to worry. This is Boss' special barrier, which takes away an enemy's chakra! It's just not possible for anyone
inside the barrier to resist. Wh-What?! D-Damn you...! Get him! He's...strong. Don't panic! Just stick to the Boss' strategy
and use the next jutsu! Multi Mugenhouyo! Let's see you free yourself
from this... What?! This is... nothing! Damn... I can't believe he can still move
after losing so much chakra! No time to be impressed. Let's get this over with! What is it? You're... I couldn't help but overhear
what you said. So the leader of the bandits
is Shiranami. Where the hell did you
take Hotaru to?! Wh-What's with this guy? This is bad, Akaboshi. The Boss should be
in the village by now. Time for us to go too! - Right!
- Right! This is...the village
of the Tsuchigumo Clan? Are you awake, Lady Hotaru? Sir...Shiranami? Come on out, everyone. Lady Hotaru has come home. These people are... Did something happen
to the villagers? I used a jutsu to make them
obedient, that's all. What?! I had no choice. It's all for the sake
of getting the Forbidden Jutsu. Sir Shiranami! Did you trick me?! I didn't trick you.
What I told you earlier is true. Although I should add
that my old man, who died protecting the Forbidden Jutsu,
was actually killed by me! I killed my old man after trying to take the Forbidden Jutsu
from him! Lady Hotaru! CONTROL It's useless.
You're already under my jutsu. The Forbidden Jutsu... The Forbidden Jutsu is finally
within my grasp! It's just a dried up branch. Rather than tracking
the soil like that, wouldn't it be faster if I just used
my Multi Shadow Clones? And destroy any trace left of Hotaru? Looking at this imprint... There's no doubt about it. These are footprints of someone who
was carrying a body under his arm. This way. Hey! You're sure? Every search begins by analyzing
all traces that are left behind. That's one of the basic rules for a ninja. For someone who boasts
about their master, neither you nor Hotaru received adequate
training from your masters, have you? That's not true! Seriously... That's what happens
when you're obsessed over something as stupid as masters. H-Hey! Hold on there! There's nothing stupid about it! I learned all sorts of things from
the Pervy Sage. Taijutsu...ninjutsu...
That goes without saying. I mean, really great jutsu. But he wasn't just strict... He also taught me what's most important
about being a ninja... The guts to never give up. What I received from my master
was valuable. It wasn't stupid or useless. You had a master too, didn't you? Memories of my master... Mission accomplished! Ninja must perform their missions swiftly. Right, Master? You fool! Huh?! Your mission was to track
the stolen scroll! Who said to bring it back?! Your life is precious!
Do not waste your life! A ninja never runs away from
a battle that must be fought. However, a ninja never fights
an unnecessary battle! Still... I'm glad that you are all right. Master... He cared for me...
That's what I thought. But... That power...is too great
for you to be its vessel. S-Stop! It wasn't me he cared about... but the "power" inside me. He merely saw me as its vessel. But...if what Tsurugi said is true... Hey! Is this it?! Huh? Oh, yeah... Hey, this is the village of
the Tsuchigumo Clan! It is? But the tracks all led to this place. I wonder if something happened? The bandits attacked Hotaru here. And... And the villagers here didn't
think highly of Hotaru. The fact that the Forbidden Jutsu
was shunned in this village is pretty obvious. Yeah. And if Hotaru was attacked
right in this village... The bandits and the village
are connected, or the village just turned
a blind eye to it. In any case, the bandits are using
this village as their hideout. Also, the footprints that
were left behind... They just don't seem natural. Maybe he became overconfident
after he got the Forbidden Jutsu... Or maybe he's planning to ambush us. You mean, a trap?! I'm not sure. But tracking them
has gone too smoothly. "Beware when the chase
seems too easy." That is what my master... Anyway, let's be careful. Yeah. Seems you did learn stuff
from your master. After we rescue Hotaru,
you should teach her some of that. Let's go! H-Huh? Are you sure this is the place? I think so. Thank you. Sure. Just for that, here! What's going on?! Here they come. What? These guys... They've joined up with the bandits
to come after us? But... Yeah, this is different.
They're being manipulated. What?! How dirty... Here they come! Damn! We can't proceed any further
without hurting the villagers. So, what do you suggest we do?! What happened to
your earlier enthusiasm? It's hopeless, eh? Those guys are controlling
the villagers... Get 'em, guys! Don't give 'em
a moment's rest! What? Sai! Captain Yamato! Naruto! Sakura! Naru...to! You idiot! Stop going off
on your own like that! I-I'm sorry...
But how come you're here? We were looking for Lady Hotaru, who had disappeared from
Mount Katsuragi. We had Sai push himself. I'm really not cut out
for physical labor. I didn't expect to use
so much chakra. Here, have a food pill. I'll have one later. What are you talking about? What if something happens to you? It's my special food pill.
So get energized! You know, that thing tastes awful... Stop fraternizing! Shoot! We won't let you go past here. You can't interfere with the Boss' ritual. Wordbind Jutsu. My years of painstaking preparation
are about to pay off. Your heart must also be rejoicing over
the Forbidden Jutsu's release. What is this?! Sai! Sakura! Captain Yamato! Wood Style! Captain Yamato! You two, go on ahead! But! Leave this to us, Naruto! Go, Naruto! You must save Hotaru! Guys, I'm counting on you! We'll save you right away, Hotaru! Hey! What do you mean chakras
are being gathered past here?

 The chakra existing within
the atmosphere and terrain

 are being drawn towards
a single direction!

 Hotaru must also be there!

 Damn it... I don't get it!

 What is Shiranami planning to do?!

 Time is running out!

 If you have time to talk,
then get moving!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Forbidden Jutsu Released"

 We're coming, Hotaru! Tune in again!

He has grown. But...he's still not good enough. <i>Damn it! This hurts.</i> <i>But this is...a Genjutsu...
I've got to overpower it!</i> <i>Naruto...</i> <i>Naruto...!</i> Sasuke...? <i>Long time no see, Naruto...</i> <i>I failed to kill you back then,
you see...</i> <i>You're finished!</i> <i>Why...?</i> <i>Why...didn't you stop Sasuke?
I believed in you...</i> <i>You couldn't protect your friends...</i> <i>I was counting on you...
I'm so disappointed.</i> <i>You always...</i> <i>You always come out ahead...</i> <i>You always...achieve happiness...</i> <i>It's a Genjutsu...</i> <i>I know...
it's a Genjutsu, but...!</i> <i>Naruto... I believed in you...</i> <i>I'm so disappointed...
Naruto...</i> <i>It's...always you...</i> <i>This time...I'll finish you off!</i> <i>Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!</i> <i>I know it's a Genjutsu, but...!</i> Say, say! I get the part where you temporarily
stop the flow of Chakra and use a greater Chakra
than the enemy's to disrupt the flow of Chakra. But what if that still doesn't work...? What should I do if
I can't break the Genjutsu?! At that time... you give up! What?! You'd have to accept you were
out of luck, and just give up. That's the way it goes
with Genjutsu. No way... Then what was the point of falling
into the river and getting drenched? However...if you've got
your comrades with you... there just might be a chance! Get them to touch you and
funnel their Chakra into you. By doing that, you have the flow
of Chakra inside you disrupted... Then...you can break the Genjutsu. <i>I believed in you...</i> <i>I'm so disappointed...</i> <i>It's always you...</i> <i>I'll finish you off!</i> <i>Naruto!</i> <i>Sakura...</i> <i>Naruto!</i> <i>Kakashi Sensei...</i> <i>Naruto!</i> <i>Gaara...</i> <i>Naruto!</i> <i>Sasuke...</i> <i>S-Somebody...
give me Chakra...</i> K-Kakashi Sensei...Sakura... Please...give me Chakra! You okay, Naruto?! What happened to me...? You were caught in a Genjutsu! But you're okay now! We poured our Chakra in you
and broke the Genjutsu! Where's...his Shadow Clone...? Shadow Clone...?
He's using no such thing. You suddenly started running and shot off your Rasengan
with nothing around. Don't you remember? <i>Rasengan!</i> <i>Then back then...
I was already in the Genjutsu...</i> This guy's using more
than just a Vision Jutsu... Now, it's about time for the main event. Get it together, Naruto! Hey! Get a grip! Naruto, I'll show you how it's done. <i>Fire Style...</i> <i>Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i> He dodged it! Here comes the next attack! <i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i> <i>The Secret Weapon is Called...
  
  
</i> Lightning Blade! Rasengan! Did they get him...? Naruto! <i>I see... He sure has learned
 an interesting Jutsu.</i> <i>However...</i> <i>Damn it! I guess
 it won't be that easy.</i> <i>I thought I totally got behind him</i> <i>using Kakashi Sensei's
Lightning Blade as a diversion...</i> <i>The Sharingan sure is a problem.</i> <i>He can instantly foresee
what I'm going to do.</i> <i>Not again!</i> <i>This isn't going to work without
a combination attack with Kakashi Sensei.</i> <i>On top of that, I'll need a powerful Jutsu
that can beat him in one shot...</i> <i>I'll have to try out that Jutsu...</i> <i>Where's Naruto...?
Is he okay?</i> <i>What?! Is this one of his Genjutsu?!</i> <i>A Hidden Mist Jutsu?!</i> Don't worry! It's one of Kakashi's Jutsu. Then... More importantly,
the mist is getting thicker! Don't avert your attention away
from his presence! R-Right! <i>The Hidden Mist Jutsu...</i> <i>It's indeed an effective Jutsu</i> <i>for making it difficult
to cast a Genjutsu...</i> <i>But it's meaningless against me,
who possesses the Sharingan...</i> Could we please stop this childish game
of hide and seek, Mr.Kakashi?! I suppose we could... <i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i> <i>I get it! Awesome, Kakashi Sensei!</i> <i>The Fireball Jutsu...</i> <i>But I noticed earlier,
something's off...</i> Don't tell me, Kakashi Sensei...
is under his Genjutsu?! Just as I'd expect...
You sure know how to use a Jutsu... Since you hid yourself temporarily
using the Earth Style, I didn't notice in time... No wonder...
my Genjutsu's having no effect. This is a Shadow Clone. <i>He's fast...!</i> Is that...? Yeah... Game over! Asakujaku! Looks like it's over... Take him out, my Shadow Clone
and all, Naruto! - I know!
- I know! Huh? Improve my Rasengan? That's right... I can already use the Rasengan
well enough! More importantly,
teach me some new Jutsu! Listen, you... Do you think the Rasengan
you use now is good enough...? Think back to when you fought that four-eyed guy
who was with Orochimaru. <i>I don't know what kind
of Jutsu you've learned.</i> <i>But you can't hit me with
that large of a motion.</i> <i>This won't work...
It's too tough to hit a moving target...</i> And then what did you do next?! <i>You won't get away now...</i> Are you going to get
your hand cut open each time you face off
against an enemy? That's exactly why
I need a new Jutsu! Are you being serious? Don't tell me you've forgotten? The Rasengan is a Jutsu
the Fourth Hokage left behind for us! Oh...Uh... Well...
I haven't forgotten it or anything... Fair enough. The Rasengan is a Jutsu completed
by the Fourth Hokage. Now you should try
to make it your own. Improve the Rasengan and make it
into your own original Jutsu. Huh?! My own original Jutsu... That's right. Use that massive Chakra
of yours to make the Rasengan
easier to hit an enemy with. It'll be a Jutsu possible only
through that massive Chakra. It'll be your own original Rasengan! My own original Rasengan! And in order to improve
the power of the Rasengan, you need to build up
much more Chakra. The training will once again be rough! But if you complete it,
it will become your strongest weapon. We'll call it... - Giant...Rasengan!
- Giant...Rasengan! A-Amazing...! Ooh... He's...! What...was up with that smile? I do get the feeling I fought him
somewhere before, but... You really don't remember? It looked like he knew
a lot about you, Guy Sensei... What's going on...? H-He's... Wh-What's this...? While we were fighting,
I felt like something wasn't right... What do you mean?! It's one of...their Jutsu or something... He's... What is this?
What in the world does this mean? I don't know... But...there's one thing I can say... I don't know this man, after all! Do you know him...? Yes... It's Yura...
He's a Jonin from our village... Seeking the truth always involves
putting one's life at risk. As we pursued mystery,
the desert's blazing sun, sand storms and poisonous scorpions
awaited us. However, we will end up reforming
the darkness of history. Secrets about the statue beyond
our imagination will now be revealed! It's on next! "Pursue romance
in the Shinobi world, mysterious lands,
and the mystery of the giant statue!" That's just a statue of
the previous Kazekage. Next episode:
"The Secret of Jinchuriki" The Forbidden Jutsu Released

 No wonder it was useless looking
for the Forbidden Jutsu. CONTROL He had used his own granddaughter
as its hiding place. That En no Gyoja... What a cruel thing to do. If the Forbidden Jutsu is removed
from its human vessel, it would become lost forever. And unless the human who became
its vessel is skilled enough to control it, the Forbidden Jutsu cannot be activated... So even if someone were to come
after the Forbidden Jutsu, they cannot lay a hand on it. En no Gyoja's kindness has protected it. However, if it stays this way,
the treasure will be wasted. Right now, you are no more than
a storage tank accumulating natural energy. You have yet to wield the activation jutsu
necessary to set off that collected natural energy. And then I come along... The sole survivor of the Tsuchigumo Clan
who has mastered that jutsu. What a lucky turn of events, right Hotaru? The jutsu which will restore the clan
to its glory is on the verge of
seeing the light of day. Let's use it to give a scare to those
who denounced our clan. What is it, Hotaru?
Aren't you happy? Then laugh. Come on. I see. You're happy too? You should be. You should be. Tsuchigumo Style:
Forbidden Jutsu Release! Big Bang! It's coming... It's coming... Now, the trump card to our clan's revival... The moment is here... The Forbidden Jutsu shall awaken
after its decade-long seal! Gather chakra! Overflow in Hotaru's body,
which serves as the vessel! And manifest your formidable power! Utakata! What are you doing?! Chakra is flowing... Chakra? I don't see anything. It is probably chakra that exists
within the atmosphere and terrain. What is this? They're riding the chakra, the chakra's current,
towards a certain location. And Hotaru is... She's there?! Let's go! Right! Why is the chakra gathering there? Hey, you're sure Hotaru will be there? If you have time to talk,
then get moving. Hotaru... Over there! All right! Hotaru! We're too late... Useless bunch. Couldn't they at least hold you off
a little longer? Oh well, I don't mind having
an audience. You bastard! What did you do to Hotaru?! Sir Utakata... Hotaru's dream... I'm just helping her to realize it. The revival of the Tsuchigumo Clan. And the key to that is activating the Forbidden Jutsu
with my abilities. Your ability? What do you mean? She doesn't have the skill to
activate the Forbidden Jutsu yet. She's only able to accumulate
the chakra in nature. So I'll activate it for her,
from the outside. In order to restore the tarnished honor
of the Tsuchigumo Clan. What honor?! All you're trying to do
is steal Hotaru's feelings for her grandfather, Tonbei,
and her people. Everything that Hotaru holds dear! Who needs something
as cheap as feelings? I'm going to steal the world. What?! As long as I have this, be it
the five Kage's or the Lords... No one will be able to ignore me. A new village... No, I can even attain lands
superior to the Five Great Nations. Are you out of your mind?! I've never been more serious. Now that I've come this far,
I can take on the Five Great Nations. With this Forbidden Jutsu, taking over the world is
not just a dream! I knew it! You don't give a damn...
about the people of the Tsuchigumo Clan! Yeah...that goes without saying. What about...
What about Hotaru's feelings?! As if I care. She put her faith in you... A carved seal of that magnitude
was embedded into her... and she protected that
Forbidden Jutsu with all her might... for the sake of her people. And she entrusted you with it. Huh? It's true that I killed my own father
in order to satisfy my greed. But you're not one to talk.
I know all about you. You're listed in the Bingo Book,
aren't you? You're a Rogue Ninja from
the Hidden Mist, right? You turned your back on
the Hidden Mist. I don't need to be lectured
by someone... who doesn't care about his village! I can tell we're alike, you and I.
We smell the same! I didn't trick you. What I told you earlier is true. Although I should add that my old man, who died protecting
the Forbidden Jutsu, was actually killed by me! Utakata is a heinous criminal who killed his master and
escaped from the village. No... Sir Utakata is nothing like this man! And yet, and yet I... What?! Th-This...power... Wait! Stop! Stop! Did I hit it right on the mark? Well, whatever. But since Hotaru is
so attached to her people, I'm willing to name my new nation
after the Tsuchigumo. I'm not a bandit, after all. Thinking of the land of my birth, I'm helping to bring it back to glory. I'd say I'm a pretty fine person! Don't kid around! You're right.
Maybe I don't give a damn... about my village... Utakata... But what will happen to Hotaru? She'll live. As the ultimate weapon
for the Forbidden Jutsu. I will control this great jutsu... and she will be my tool. Tool... Did you say "tool"?! Yes... My tool! Shut up! CONTROL Too bad. You can't oppose me anymore. Just like Hotaru. Good... More... Let your body overflow with chakra! Now then, what shall
I make you do? How about making comrades
fight each other? I can't move... Or maybe bodyguards? You can guard my tool. Why you... CONTROL Don't think you can get near
my tool so easily. Don't call her your tool... Hotaru is not a tool! Don't talk. You're irritating. Forget it. You have no grounds to object. Hotaru chose me.
She chose to become the vessel. To Sir Utakata, I will work to revive the Tsuchigumo Clan
with Sir Shiranami. Thank you for all you have done. Good-bye...
From your student, Hotaru. Hotaru doesn't want
to be rescued by you. So stay there and watch as the Tsuchigumo
village disappears in an instant. Sir Utakata. I'm so sorry. It's all because I was so foolish... Hmm... You still have the will to resist. Sir Utakata. Damn it! Just a little more... Just a little more
and Hotaru's vessel will be full of chakra. You will be my witnesses to
the resurrection of the Forbidden Jutsu. There's no way we can put up
a fight against those four like this. First, we have to stop the villagers. But how? It can't be helped if we get
a bit rough with them. We'll isolate them all in one place. I'm sorry! I have to get a little rough. Cha! Super Beast Scroll! Wood Style! Four Pillar House Jutsu! We'll have them lay low there
for a while. Way to ruin our fun. We can't keep letting them
have their way. That's our line. I wonder about that. It's no fun...without an audience. Oh boy...
There's just no end to this, is there? Damn it... You're doing well, Hotaru. Our guests are probably
getting anxious. Now surrender
your body and soul to me! Unleash the chakra you've
accumulated all at once! This place which rejected you...
Let's reduce it into ashes! Ninja Art... What?! Bubble Bomb! You blockhead! When did you set that up? If you had behaved,
you could've lived a bit longer. Why did my Wordbind Jutsu...? These guys... The amount of chakra is unnatural... Like we'd let you control us so easily! I won't let you! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Wordbind Jutsu! Rock! Rock! You bastard! Hotaru... Are you all right, Hotaru?! Hotaru! What do we do? Why you... You still wanna fight? Whoa! Have you forgotten that
my Wordbind Jutsu controls Hotaru? Get back! Damn! She isn't fully charged with
the chakra from nature, but... Now Hotaru... Let us show them. How dreadful
the Forbidden Jutsu is! Now let us start. No. Let us show the world! Our... No, my...power! No... No! Die! Fury Jutsu! No! I didn't want to hurt anybody.

 I wanted to protect this jutsu
entrusted by my grandfather

 and carry out his dream.

 And yet, I hurt Naruto and Sir Utakata
with my very own hands!

 I don't want it.
I betrayed Sir Utakata.

 Someone like me should disappear
along with the Forbidden Jutsu!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Master and Student"

 Goodbye, Sir Utakata... Tune in again!

 What's that?! It looks like the Boss took possession
of the Forbidden Jutsu. Take a look Hotaru,
isn't it magnificent? This is the power of
the Forbidden Jutsu! The art we honed together. No... I couldn't have... No... No! I... I... killed Sir Utakata? Oh, come on... This is a problem... I don't need a vessel
that comes with feelings. CONTROL Now then, once more. This time, the Tsuchigumo village. Those worthless villagers... Incinerate them all! Wood Style Jutsu! It's useless! Hah! You see?
You can't hurt the villagers. However, I couldn't care less
what happens to people like them! This is the end! We got them! What?! Benten?! How did you guys...?! Like this! The jutsu created by the four of you
was quite formidable. But with just two remaining,
you're no match for us. With this Forbidden Jutsu,
I'll conquer small nations and make the Five Great Nations tremble. N-Not likely... A-As if I'll let you have...
your way. Utakata! This is no time
to be lying around! Yeah... We have to get Hotaru back. Hmph! Don't know when to die,
do you? Do you want another taste
of the Forbidden Jutsu? Like I'll let you! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Go! Don't underestimate me! Wordbind Jutsu, Explode! Utakata! Get Hotaru now,
while there's a chance! I won't let you! Wordbind Jutsu, Flame! What's the matter? Is that all you have? No! You can't form seals now... Hotaru! Damn it! I'll pay you back tenfold! Hotaru! You...! You're activating
the Forbidden Jutsu again?! It's not me! Look at this...
My hands are bound! Then what's going on here?! Who knows? Maybe it's from absorbing
too much natural energy. Stop it right now! And how am I supposed to do that
with my hands like this? Release. Now then... Damn! Hey! Hurry up and stop it! The Wordbind Jutsu...isn't working. This is... What's wrong? It's getting worse. If it keeps accumulating
the chakra from nature like this, it'll explode along with
the entire village. What?! Hotaru... Master and Student

 Damn it... The revival of the Tsuchigumo Clan... The wishes of En no Gyoja... After being forced to take on
all the grown-ups' selfish desires, Hotaru has finally lost it! Shut up! What the hell would
you know about Hotaru?! All alone, she kept
the Forbidden Jutsu safe! She happily offered herself for
the sake of restoring her clan. She shouldered the entire burden...
by herself. But then she met Utakata... And although you tricked her,
she met you, her senior. Hotaru... She was finally able
to find a comrade. People she could share a bond with. And you crushed it! Comrade? Bond?
Don't give me that nonsense! I'm the same as Hotaru. For the sake of the Forbidden Jutsu, they would sacrifice their student,
their own son, without hesitation. Saying it's what a ninja would do... That it's the only way to survive. I went through it all
until I got sick of it! That's why I went on the offensive. I killed my father,
who had been my master, and I tried to steal
the Forbidden Jutsu. What?! And you over there... Didn't you basically
do the same thing? I...I... You're wrong. Huh? My master always...
thinks about his student... About me. No matter how far apart we are... I can always feel his thoughts. He's in my heart every single minute! That's why I can believe in him. Hotaru also has
her grandfather and Tonbei. And Utakata... Your feelings should
have reached her too! It exists deep inside her heart! Even now, she yearns for her comrade,
for her master... for her bond! You don't know anything about her! Don't talk like you do! Dream on! Wordbind Jutsu! Split! Naruto! Thanks... Shoot... For now, I'd better fall back
before the vessel explodes! Hotaru! I'll bring Shiranami back. - I'm coming...
- No! You're Hotaru's master. Stay with her. I'm counting on you! Got it! Hotaru also has
her grandfather and Tonbei. And Utakata... Your feelings should
have reached her too! My feelings...are within her! As well as within my heart... That's right... My anger had closed off my ears. But I did hear... No, I did feel...
my master's thoughts. It was there.
My master's thoughts... They reached me, and yet... Utakata... Live...side by side with this power. I had sworn never to use
your power again. But I beg you, help me,
for Hotaru's sake! Hotaru... I didn't want to hurt anybody... And yet... I hurt Naruto and Sir Utakata! I'm right here.
Naruto and I are both alive. I... Hotaru? I...I betrayed you, Sir Utakata. Someone like me should disappear
along with this Jutsu! No! I will not allow that. A student should listen
to her master! You said... Master... We're going home, Hotaru. What's wrong? No! No... Sir Utakata... Please get away from me!
Please run! Hotaru! I cannot suppress it any longer... The Forbidden Jutsu is
going to tear me apart... and explode. It's all right. Sir Utakata... Believe in your master. So be it, destroy this entire village! Eradicate everything! Damn it! Multi... Shadow Clone Jutsu! Persistent bastard! Wordbind Jutsu, Flame! Fool! I'm going through! I'm not going to forgive you,
no matter what! Wordbind Jutsu! Slice! Rasengan! What?! I've gotta take him to
Hotaru right away! What is that? Hey! Utakata! Are you all right? Yeah... Master... What a troublesome student you are. By the way, what happened
to the Forbidden Jutsu? It seems to have disappeared. Disappeared? But Hotaru's safe, right?
That's a relief. Naruto... Sakura! Well then, the mission negotiated
between the Tsuchigumo Clan and the Hidden Leaf has been
successfully completed. Thank you for everything. The Forbidden Jutsu is no more. However... Yes. I think it was for the better. Now Lady Hotaru will no longer
be targeted. And the villagers will accept Hotaru
without reservations. But now... Are you going, after all?
With Utakata? I still have much more to learn. After I have trained with
my master and become a ninja strong enough to help restore
the Tsuchigumo Clan, I promise to return to this village. Good for you, "Master"! Are you toying with me? No, I'm happy
that you've finally accepted your role as a master. Take care of Hotaru. Well, everyone, take care. It's nice, after all...
Having a master. Hmm? Now I kinda...
miss the Pervy Sage too! This is where I first met you, Master. Hotaru... Will you wait here
for just a while? Is something the matter? I'm going to meet with
the Anbu Black Ops from the Hidden Mist. I'm done running. I'm going to get their permission
to travel and train you. Yes, sir! No response, after all. Did something happen to
Tsurugi and his men? The Six-Tails' Jinchuriki Host... Are you the ones...
who killed Tsurugi and his men? I'm going to build a new world. And for that, I need you. Rather, I need the Tailed Beast
inside you. So that's it... I'm taking you...Six-Tails. Hota...ru... You...must live... Shocking news suddenly arrives.

 The Leaf Ninja are shaken
as they receive

 this unexpected message.

 People are left in disbelief,
unable to cope with the situation.

 A sad storm is about to befall
the Leaf Village.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Somber News"

 Naruto! Lady Hokage
has summoned you. Tune in again!

 Sealing of the Six-Tails...
is done. It takes time when
there are five of us. There are two Tailed-Beasts left. Yes... I've sent Sasuke to go
and retrieve the Eight-Tails. Can we trust him? I can vouch for Sasuke. I know that you're alone. So why don't you run? Hah! My numbers can go
from one to a thousand! Besides, I can't run away! If I capture you,
I get to see Sasuke! Why are you so attached
to my brother? He's a Rogue Ninja. That's because unlike you... I think of him as a brother more
than you ever would. You're already under my genjutsu. Damn it! I'll say it again. I just wanted to talk to you
for a moment. You've been trying to take
Sasuke back to the village. But what if it doesn't go
the way you want? I'll do anything to
make it happen. Even by force? If by some turn of luck, Sasuke goes with you willingly, great. But what if the exact opposite happens? What does that mean? You just said you consider Sasuke
to be like a brother... What if Sasuke were to
attack the Leaf Village? What would you do then? What? Why would Sasuke...? There's no way
he'd do something like that! Sasuke is still naïve.
He can easily be dyed in any color. In such a case, can you stop him? Even if you have to kill Sasuke? Could you weigh Sasuke
against the Leaf Village on a set of scales? I would defend the Leaf Village! But I would also stop Sasuke
without killing him! You're such a child... What you speak of are all fantasies. A ninja must sometimes make
very harsh decisions. You should give up on Sasuke. He was destined to leave,
sooner or later. Don't suffer anymore... Forget and dismiss him. It's not just jutsu or power... If you're a ninja, develop eyes that can make
the right judgment. And if you're going to live
as a ninja, become wiser. This world... It's no place for a fool.
That's the reality. Okay, I got it. If that's what being wise is,
I'd rather live my life as a fool. Even if I have to do it alone, I'll figure out a bigger, better jutsu
and rescue Sasuke. Someone told me that before... But for me, there is no choice. I never go back on my word... That's my Ninja Way. I have shared some of
my power with you. Though I hope the day
never comes when you have to use it. What's going on? Aren't you after me?
Then let's finish this! I'm going now... I have an important task to do. What did Itachi mean by that?
Why did he...? Sasuke has won.
Itachi Uchiha is dead. Sasuke's down too, but...
I wonder how he is? He's in pretty bad shape. What are you doing now, Sasuke? You're okay, right? Are you all right, Sasuke? Yeah... Let's hurry. We're almost at
the rendezvous point. As promised,
I brought the Eight-Tails. You did well. I had faith
that you could do it. Where are you going? First, I'm going to tend
to my wounds. Then... I'm going to the Hidden Leaf. I'm going to ask
one important question... After learning about Itachi's life,
there is a chance that you will carry out his wish
and protect the Hidden Leaf. Tell me the truth.
What are your intentions? Itachi showed me how
a man would give his life to protect his village. But for me, the sadness
of losing Itachi impacts me more deeply
than how he lived... Unbearably more. The peace that Itachi sacrificed
himself for isn't appealing to me. Now that I know the truth, following in Itachi's steps to
protect the Hidden Leaf is the last thing I would do. Most of all, I will never forgive
the three elders. And I believe that everyone in
the Hidden Leaf enjoying the peace gained in exchange for
Itachi's life is guilty too. I thought you were only going
to kill the elders? No... I wish to slaughter
the entire Leaf Village by myself. I was just feigning in front of Taka. Is that the truth? After knowing just what
Itachi went through to protect the village... Instead of carrying on his wish,
you'd destroy the village? Are you serious? You said so yourself. The reason why Itachi couldn't
bring himself to kill me was... he cherished my life more
than the village. I feel the same way. Itachi's life is more precious
to me than the village. That's all. They shunned the Uchiha clan. They forced my brother to
kill his own parents! The elders who cast him out
and sealed his death! And the rest of the Hidden Leaf
who abide by the Senju clan! They're nothing but scum! They are all objects of
my vengeance! If you want to ridicule me as a brat swayed by his emotions, go ahead. Carrying on Itachi's wish are
merely pretty words. The foolish sputtering of those
who don't know hatred. If anyone criticizes my way of life, I'll kill every single one
of their loved ones! Then they might understand a little... ...of the hatred I carry. When a man learns to love,
he must bear the risk of hatred. What?! Killer Bee was taken?! A member of the Hidden Leaf...
from the Uchiha clan was among the assailants. My partner is tailing them right now. Lord Raikage, what are your orders? The Akatsuki won't get away
with this! The Akatsuki...! Just you wait, my brother! Somber News

 Oh, it's you, Kakashi Sensei. Lady Hokage has summoned you.
Let's go. Huh? Chief Toad and Gamakichi? Yo, Naruto! What're you guys doing here
so early? Did something happen? Actually... Gamakichi! It's not your place
to say anything. Leave this to the Boss and Tsunade. What's going on? Just hurry up. He is Jiraiya-boy's student? Yes... This is Naruto Uzumaki... The "Child of Prophecy"
you mentioned. A geezer frog? What the hell? Hey! Watch your mouth, Naruto! This is Lord Fukasaku, one of the Two Great Sages
of Mount Myoboku. He came all the way here
to speak with you. Well, to be more accurate,
I am a Great Sage Toad. But never mind that. You are, without a doubt,
Jiraiya-boy's student. Jiraiya-boy? "Boy"?! You talk as though
the Pervy Sage is a kid! Who does this geezer frog
think he is?! I said to watch your mouth! This great man is the one who taught Sage Jutsu
to Lord Jiraiya. He is Lord Jiraiya's master. Pervy Sage, eh? What a fitting nickname
for Jiraiya-boy. So what does this geezer sage
want with me? I'm not sure where to begin. But let's see... I suppose
the most important thing is... Jiraiya-boy has died in battle. Huh? Wh-What are you talking about? I know this is sudden. I don't blame you if
you don't believe me. For quite some time,
there were rumors that the leader of the Akatsuki
was in the Hidden Rain Village. Jiraiya-boy went in person to
verify the truth of these rumors. The leader of the Akatsuki was
in the Hidden Rain Village? As I recall,
that village is difficult to infiltrate. A village closed to the outside world. Yes... However, Lord Jiraiya was skilled in infiltration and
espionage tactics. Exactly... That's the decision I've made... Jiraiya Sensei. Jiraiya-boy came upon
the leader of the Akatsuki..."Pain." However... You look very different.
But those eyes... So you were Pain... Nagato! It seems you've strayed off
the path of good. What happened? You don't need to know.
After all, you are an outsider. Pain was Jiraiya-boy's former student. Student? What do you mean? Jiraiya-boy called him "Nagato." That goes way back. During the chaos of
the Great Ninja War... Jiraiya looked after some orphans
in the Hidden Rain Village, which had become a battlefield. Who would have imagined
that those kids... However... To corner a ninja like Lord Jiraiya... How did this Pain...? He possessed the Rinnegan. What did you say?! Rinnegan? The Rinnegan is an Ocular Jutsu that was said to be possessed
by the father of all ninja, the Sage of the Six Paths. I thought it was just a legend. The legendary Ocular Jutsu...
The Rinnegan. Its power was beyond imagination. Not only that... There were six of them
who possessed the Rinnegan?! How can that even be possible? Perhaps, there's a trick to it. Most likely, only Jiraiya-boy,
who was there, discovered their secret. But... Jiraiya-boy! Even after he had his throat
crushed by Pain, Jiraiya-boy left a message
before collapsing. This is that message! It's a code... I'm sure he did this to prevent
Pain from noticing. I've told you everything
about Jiraiya-boy. I wonder what Jiraiya wanted to say. If we can decode this...
we'll understand, won't we? Did you...let him go, Granny? That's right. Why'd you allow such
a reckless thing?! You knew Pervy Sage better
than anyone! How could you send him to such
a dangerous place, alone?! Enough, Naruto. You of all people ought to
know Lady Hokage's feelings. It's too dangerous to go alone! I am one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Leaf. You know what that means as well. You were beautiful back then... and now,
you're a fifty-something old granny. It pains me to see how
all the memories of your lost friends and loved ones
are stored inside that big breast of yours. And you know,
the number will continue to grow. However...I guess I shouldn't
wallow in sadness. My duty is to be a model for
the next generation and to help them out. For that, I'd happily give my life. It's what makes us old folks cool, see? Damn it! Naruto! Where are you going?! If Pervy Sage had been
the Fifth Hokage... he wouldn't have let Granny Tsunade
take such risks... Never! Naruto! Sakura... It's all right.
Let him be. But... My apologies, Lord Fukasaku. I'll arrange for Naruto to... No... That's all right. About the Child of Prophecy
I mentioned earlier... I can see that child truly loved
and admired Jiraiya-boy. I can't help but hope that
he is the Child of Prophecy. I will now teach you...
the Summoning Jutsu! This is it! Summoning Jutsu! Whoa! Huh?! Why? Why?! Why do I have to go with
the Pervy Sage on a research trip?! It's not just a research trip. There's a woman I want to research
and I must find her. Say! Say!
Why did you choose me? Long ago...
I taught the Fourth Hokage. And you have an uncanny
resemblance to him. I don't waste any time. During the journey,
you will have my undivided attention. Me? It's time to make you strong...
to train you! The boy wanders the village
in despair,

 reminiscing about the memories
with his late Master.

 The end of
his childhood days approaches...

 When all his grief is let out,
the boy will rise up once again.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Following the Master's Shadow"

 After all, we can't
stay brats forever. Tune in again!

 Naruto! Where are you going?! If Pervy Sage had been
the Fifth Hokage... he wouldn't have let Granny Tsunade
take such risks... Never! Naruto! Sakura... It's all right.
Let him be. But... I can see that child truly loved
and admired Jiraiya-boy. I can't help but hope that
he is the Child of Prophecy. Following the Master's Shadow

 I'm sorry...that you always get
the short end of the stick. What's with you?! I'm saying, you were supposed
to be Hokage. The Third Hokage always wanted
you to be the next to-- I was never cut out for
that sort of thing. Being on my own suits me too well... You regretted not being able
to stop Orochimaru. So all that time, you were tracking his movements
alone, isn't that right? I no longer need to do so. That means I get to release
the sequel to my novel sooner. Tsunade-girl... Tsunade-girl! Are you all right, Master? Yes, I'm fine. I'm sorry. You just received sad news. I don't blame you
for feeling distraught. However, you have the important duty
of protecting the village. This is where you must stay strong. Yes... Anyway, the clues left by Jiraiya-boy... There is something besides
the hidden message on my back. A Hidden Rain Ninja captured by
Jiraiya-boy is inside his belly. And, one more thing... Inside this fellow is one of Pain's bodies
that Jiraiya managed to kill. Pain's? "MAKE-OUT TACTICS"
LONG-AWAITED NEW NOVEL
BEST WORK EVER Oh, there they are! So many well-developed gals! Hey! What're you doing, Pervy Sage! What a sight! What a sight! I'm getting inspiration
for my next novel! AUTOPSY ROOM This is Pain... The ripple pattern...
Is it the legendary Rinnegan? That's correct. If we study it well, we may find clues on how
to defeat him. A ninja's corpse is
a treasure trove of information. We will gather skilled Medical Ninja,
and begin an autopsy immediately. Shizune. Yes, ma'am. I will take care of it. Hmm... That is a good photo. I have given you all that
was entrusted to me. Yes, indeed. I will return home now.
Let me know what you learn. With Jiraiya-boy's student here, you will be able to
contact Mount Myoboku. Thank you very much. I promise that we will find
a way to defeat Pain! Now listen, Naruto. I have only three years to
make you strong. I will spend that time
training you vigorously. Be prepared for that. You bet! This time, I'm going to
bring him back for sure! There's no time for me to waste. Cripes... I can't stand this... What is this?!
What's with this lame training?! Fool! Nothing in training is lame! You foolish student! You're mine! You're not the only one
who uses Shadow Clones. You're still so naïve... Damn! I was so close! Liar. It'll take a hundred years
before you can beat me. I can't wait a hundred years! Just wait... Next time... This is super-cool! Hmm... Fine feathers make
a fine bird, eh? Yo! Naruto. I hear you've been real active
on missions and such. Everyone in the village
is talking about you. Hey, let's go somewhere and catch up! How about Ichiraku for some ramen? No thanks... What? Right now? Yes. Take that,
and go immediately. The Cipher Corps folks
don't work this late. Summon them and tell them
it's on my orders. I'm putting you in charge of this case. I know it's a very important encryption, but can't you ask someone else
who's not on a mission right now? Wait... Where are you going? I came here on a different matter. Shikamaru! But... Lady Tsunade has been busy
since morning, and... Well, the same goes for me. Shikamaru, please... I must say...
You've grown even more beautiful. You haven't changed... But... If you try anything to
betray the village... At that moment, I will kill you. Then how about making a bet with me? You bet that I will die.
After all, you always lose. But if I make it back alive... Joking! I'm just joking! You know, I'm grateful to you. Heya... I'm Jiraiya! You can send me the love letters later! Nice to meet ya! You fool... 24-HOUR CONVENIENCE STORE Naruto... I heard about Lord Jiraiya. I wanted him to keep watching
over me. I wanted him to see me
become the Hokage. But I only ended up showing Pervy Sage
the worst, most un-cool side of me. I was... Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you. He was always boasting about you, saying you were like
his own grandchild. He had faith that you were
the one who would inherit his will. And truly believed that you would one day become
a great Hokage. Lord Jiraiya will always
watch over you. Even this very minute,
he's watching from somewhere. He wouldn't be happy
seeing you sad like this. So... Be your usual self,
the one he praised so much. Don't stay depressed forever. For Lord Jiraiya himself,
one of the Legendary Sannin... acknowledged you as
his promising student! Thanks... Iruka Sensei. Thank you for your efforts.
How's it going? Oh... I checked very carefully... But this isn't a Hidden Leaf code. It doesn't correspond to any
of our algorithms. But considering the fact
that Lord Jiraiya wrote this in his dying moments, I don't think it could be
anything too complex. It's a string of numbers, so it has to be
a shared-key encryption. Can you...decode it? Ahem. Err... Frankly, it's impossible
unless we know the key. Key? Namely, if you don't know
the rules that define the code, you can't break it. Unless we know something
about Lord Jiraiya that could be the key,
it's impossible. So how do we figure out what the key is? I wouldn't know... But perhaps someone who
was close to Lord Jiraiya would recognize the key. Although, given the circumstances
of his death, the encryption could have
been hastily created to prevent the enemy from
discerning his message. So we can't say for certain. Consider who he may have
intended that message for, and ask that person.
And perhaps you'll find some clues. Which means... Lady Hokage or Kakashi Sensei... Thank you very much. If I learn anything new,
I'll come again. Sure, but I'll be home in bed,
so just come by the house, ok? Well... I'm heading home to sleep. What about you, Shiho? Someone's gotta stay behind. 9...31...8...106...7...207...15... Can you think of anything? Maybe in a conversation
with Lord Jiraiya? Something about these numbers...? This number 106 is... Lord Jiraiya? It's 106. What is? 106 centimeters. No... That's not it. I can't think of anything. Why don't you try
Lady Hokage or Naruto next? I already asked Lady Hokage. Which leaves Naruto... The secret code is a concern. But I'm also worried about Naruto.
Try to cheer him up. Don't get your hopes up too high. Shoot... He's out. Shikamaru... What do you want? For starters... Can I come in? Well? Can you think of anything? Hey Naruto, I said can you think
of anything? Naruto! Oh sorry. What was it again? Come with me. Where? Just come. Wh-What is it?! LEAF HOSPITAL Why'd you bring me here? Just wait. Ah! Here she comes. Huh?! Kurenai Sensei... Yeah... Were you hospitalized for
eating too much barbeque?! Your stomach's bigger than Choji's! She's pregnant, not fat! Cripes, you're still
as obnoxious as ever. Huh?! You mean...she's...? Shikamaru, stop coming here so often. Sorry, no can do.
Asuma asked me to do so. Shikamaru... What did Asuma
ask you to do? That child will be my student. Huh? Asuma entrusted that child to me. I heard about Lord Jiraiya. I lost my teacher, so it's not like I don't understand
what you're going through. But whining and sulking isn't going
to make things better. We're way past that point in our lives. What do you mean? My teacher entrusted me
with many things. Some important, some petty.
All sorts of things. You too, right? In fact, you must have a ton of stuff. So don't you think it's about time
for us to step up? Time for what? Time for us  to become
the ones who entrust. It's a pain,
but we can't keep complaining. You will eventually be
the one treating to ramen, and you'll be called Naruto Sensei,
or something. We can't stay brats forever... If we wanna become super cool ninja
like Asuma and Lord Jiraiya, that is. You're right. Thanks, Shikamaru. Pull yourself together. You got work to do. Right! Comrades move on to decode
the message left behind.

 Entrusted to Naruto from Jiraiya,
what is the key to the encryption?

 Shikamaru's brain and Shiho's experience
leads them

 to a certain answer.

 Finally, the hidden mystery
is revealed!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Decryption"

 What is Jiraiya's message? Tune in again!

 What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday...

 "Decryption"
HIDDEN LEAF
INTEL DIVISION Initially, Jiraiya-boy's purpose
was to gather intelligence. It appears he never intended
to battle Pain. But Pain's abilities far exceeded
his imagination. Unless we knew the scope
of his powers, no one would ever be able
to defeat Pain. Jiraiya-boy went beyond his own limits, and almost managed to
uncover Pain's secrets. No one but Jiraiya-boy
could have gotten as far. On top of that...
He could have escaped if he chose to. Instead he sacrificed his life
to leave this coded message. He entrusted the rest to you all. This frog supposedly contains
a captured Hidden Rain Ninja. We received prior notice
from Lord Jiraiya. Now, grow. Be as rough as you need to be. Get everything you can from him! I intend to. AUTOPSY ROOM 3
SHIZUNE     OYONE     KUMADORI This is one of the three crucial sources
of data Lord Jiraiya left us. We must learn everything
we can from it. - Yes, Ma'am!
- Yes, Ma'am! All right. Let's begin. You haven't said a word.
You see something, right? I talked to Lady Hokage
and Kakashi Sensei, but neither of them had any clue. That means Lord Jiraiya probably
left this message with you in mind. No, I'm positive he did. There's got to be something there. If anything pops up in your mind,
tell us. We're not asking you to
instantly decode the message. There is one thing that's been
bothering me since I first saw this. What is it? Well... There's all these numbers. So what's with this
one katakana letter? Huh? Katakana? Where do you see that? Right here. What are you talking about?
Isn't that the number "9"? That's what I thought at first... But this is not the number "9." It's the katakana letter "ta." What? Well, I guess you could
look at it that way. But I think that's a big stretch. I wonder... Uzumaki, what made you think
this nine was the katakana letter "ta"? Well... Pervy Sage was writing books
all the time... He was an author, after all. And I traveled all over with him. He always made me read
his handwritten drafts, and asked what I thought about them. They were really boring though... What the heck? What's "Nine-ctics"? And whenever there was
the letter "ta," it was hard to read because it would look
like the number nine. I see... A penmanship quirk! That was his habit, huh? So what you're saying is... When writing the katakana "ta," Lord Jiraiya had a habit of
shortening his first stroke. So the first and third strokes
get connected. And since he rounds
his second stroke, it looks like the number nine. Found it. Let's see... This is a sample of
Lord Jiraiya's writing. It's the same! Lord Jiraiya knew that
Naruto would remember his habit of writing the katakana "ta"
like the number nine. Frankly, this was the common link
between Lord Jiraiya and Naruto. Why didn't you mention such
an important thing sooner?! Well, what's the big deal about
knowing that it's the letter "ta"? That's it! It's when you were reading
Lord Jiraiya's manuscript that you found out about
his writing habit. Then the code refers to that
book you were reading! Book? That's it, Shikamaru! Right! Frankly, Lord Jiraiya's book
must contain a hint. Those numbers must represent character numbers, line numbers
or page numbers. I'm certain they hold the key
to the code. Naruto, which book is it? Umm... Hmm... Make-Out...
What was it? Well then, how many of
Lord Jiraiya's books have been published? I'm not sure... Four? Five? Then let's just check all of them! It's probably this one. MAKE-OUT TACTICS Make-Out Tactics... - "Ta"?!
- "Ta"?! Kakashi Sensei! It's been on my mind, so I decided to stop by when
I overheard your voices. I think I caught most of it. This is the book you're looking for. "Make-Out Tactics." That's right. That's the one Pervy Sage was
working on during our training. I see... Only Naruto would've known that. So Lord Jiraiya did pass
the key on to Naruto. Uh-huh! This "ta" is the first character
in the code. Of Lord Jiraiya's books,
this is the only title that begins with "ta." When a character is used
in a code, it could signify word placement
or line number, but the established protocol is
to check the page number first. So...the numbers separated
by commas are 31, 8, 106, 7, 207, and 15.
Six sets. Meaning there are six pages
worth of information. Let's start with page 31. Flip to that page, please. Page 31... Okay, here it is. Where do we look next? In situations like this, we look at the first character
on the page. Please read the sentence out loud
starting from the top. Wha-? No... I mean... What is it?! Hurry up and read! Hurry it up! "I-I-I...really... love you." CIPHER DIVISION There! We now have all six pages. Well? If I read the first characters
of the code in order... The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them... That's what it says. What does that mean? I don't know. We ought to relay this
to Lord Fukasaku. He fought with Pain,
so he may know something. Then let's go right away
to the Lady Hokage to ask this Lord Fukasaku to come. May I come along? Yeah, please do, Shiho. Yes, sir! All right! Let's go let Granny know! "The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them." Well, Geezer Sage?! Anything? Of those six, not a single one
reminds me of Nagato. Yet a completely unrelated Pain
knew of a conversation that the Rinnegan-bearing Nagato
and I shared alone. The faces are different,
but I definitely sense Nagato in them. I don't know...
This alone is too vague. But there's something? I've already told you
what I know about Pain. Even if he dies,
he can resurrect himself. So I can't say just from speculations. Under such conditions,
taking Pain on is too dangerous. We must uncover all his secrets first. What about the other sources
of information? How are the autopsy and
interrogation coming along? It looks like they will take
more time. Like how long? I can't say. Oh, come on!
We can't be wasting time right now! Interrogation aside, an autopsy requires minute cell
and tissue analyses! These things take time! It'll be a week at the soonest. That long...? Now, Uzumaki...
Don't be so disappointed. So what should we do, Lady Hokage? Shizune is heading up the autopsy... It should be quicker than usual. Still, we have no choice but to wait. I'll go and make them speed it up. Naruto! You get in
Master Shizune's way, and I'll give you a beating! I will avenge Pervy Sage! I can't just sit around doing nothing! But Naruto-boy... Even if we decoded the message,
it has nothing to do with you. Just what do you mean by that?! In any case, at this point,
you couldn't beat Pain. What?! Tell me. Even Jiraiya-boy
couldn't beat this opponent. Are you saying you're confident
you can? Well... If you were to fight him now,
you'd die a senseless death. Then Geezer Sage,
are you telling me to forget about avenging
the Pervy Sage? No such thing. Being asked to come was
quite opportune. I was planning on coming
to get you, Naruto-boy. How about it, Naruto-boy? Want to train in Sage Jutsu
under my guidance? Sage Jutsu training? I see... Naruto learning Sage Jutsu.
That is a great plan. Is Sage Jutsu really that awesome? Yes. Lord Jiraiya was the only one
capable of using it in this village. Pain defeated Jiraiya who had summoned Lord Fukasaku
and Lady Shima. What that means is... At this point, no one in
the Leaf Village can defeat Pain. I am just as mortified... I, too, want to avenge the death
of my student Jiraiya-boy. I believe that the only one who
can do that is you, Naruto-boy. Me...? You want to avenge Jiraiya-boy,
don't you? Of course I do! Then come with me. I'll train you in Sage Jutsu
at Mount Myoboku. Everything that I drove
into Jiraiya-boy, I will do the same with you. Will it let me win against Pain?! That I can't guarantee. It all depends on you, Naruto-boy. Is that fine with you, Tsunade? Of course... Naruto, go. Sage Jutsu training is more rigorous
than you can ever imagine. Are you up to it? Pervy Sage did it, right? Then I can't lose to him! I'll do it! An entrusted student...
The Child of Prophecy. Nicely said! Then, let us go. Naruto-boy, say your goodbyes. I'm off. I'm counting on you with
the code, Shikamaru. Don't worry about us. I will contact you the moment the results of the autopsy
and interrogation are in. I will leave
the messenger frog behind. If there's anything,
give it to him. Yes sir. Good luck, Naruto! Right! All right! Let's go! By the way,
which way is Mount Myoboku? Can we really trust this guy? It takes a month to
get there on foot. It's also known as
Maze Mountain. If you don't know the secret route,
you won't be able to get there. It's hard just to get there, eh? Naruto-boy... You already signed
a binding contract with us toads. There's no need to worry. Hey! That's the... Well then, I'll be borrowing this boy. Please take care of him. But what do you mean,
there's no need to worry? He disappeared? It's a Reverse Summoning. Wow... Good luck on your end too. All right! Let's concentrate on figuring
out the data Jiraiya left us. Roger. The fact that the Great Lord Elder
prophesied Jiraiya writing those books... It may have been intended
to enable him to eventually leave
the encrypted message. Meaning the prophecy may all be real. In which case, Naruto Uzumaki... He truly is the Child of Prophecy... Where...are we? Geezer Sage...
What is this place? The Land of Toad. The Land of Toad? Naruto! Gamakichi! I summoned you here, Naruto. I see... Is that how? Before we train, we must eat.
Come along. Food?! Now, eat up! I went all out
to prepare this meal! Now, now... Don't be shy. Try these caterpillars. Th-Thank you... Ma will have a fit if
she sees you like this. I forced it all down, didn't I?! When you're hungry,
your belly isn't choosy. You'll get used to it in time. By that time...
I'll no longer be a human being. Now let's begin your training. Yes sir! First of all, I must explain that what I'm about to teach you
is not ninjutsu, but Sage Jutsu. Explain? Listen well... As opposed to ninjutsu, where you utilize your own
internal energy, Sage Jutsu involves taking in
outside energy for your use. Outside? What do you mean? As you're probably aware, Ninjutsu utilizes chakra that is molded
from one's Mental and Physical Energy. Sage Jutsu involves NIN                 SAGE
taking that internally generated chakra MENTAL          PHYSICAL
and adding Nature Energy
from the outside, resulting in an even
more powerful chakra. MENTAL     PHYSICAL     NATURE
And that leads to all
your ninjutsu, genjutsu, and even your taijutsu getting
a real power boost. Mental and Physical Energy
within oneself, and Nature Energy from the outside. Jutsu and techniques born
from the chakra created by these three combined energies
is what's known as Sage Jutsu. Hmm... Look at it this way... If you add mint flavor to
chocolate-vanilla ice cream, then it tastes even better. That makes it more confusing, Gamakichi! Oh... I get it! You understood that analogy? That's the kind of guy Naruto is. So what's this Nature Energy
really about? Energy that is external to you. The energy that exists in
the atmosphere and the terrain. Atmosphere and terrain... Okay... As in, the air and in the ground. Oh, is that what he meant? Bah! Enough words. I will show you. This should be good enough. Wow! Lord Fukasaku is amazing! Look at him gather all
that Nature Energy! Where? Where?! Oh, wow... H-He lifted it! How about that? This is the power of
Nature Energy-enhanced Sage Jutsu. But I don't know what you did... I only saw you weave a sign
at the beginning. Well, naturally. Right now, you're not yet able
to sense Nature Energy, Naruto-boy. So it's impossible for you to absorb it. Then how do I do it? You must become one with nature! Become one...? As in, you have to die. What? Naruto engages in Sage Jutsu training
at Mount Myoboku.

 Being much different from ninjutsu,

 Naruto struggles with
the training.

 Fukasaku then reveals what
it takes to become a Sage.

 Encouraged by the path taken
by his master,

 Naruto shows he has the guts
to never give up.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The First Challenge"

 All right! I'll do this! Tune in again!

 Die?! How come becoming one
with nature means dying? Gamakichi, what's with the dying?! Don't make such weird analogies! But... Relax. You're not actually
going to die, Naruto-boy. Then what? Just wait 'til I'm finished... I'll explain it stepwise. Absorbing Nature Energy... It means the ability to
sense it around you and draw it into yourself. In addition,
by becoming one with nature, you also gain full control
over the Nature Energy entering and leaving your body. Practically speaking,
in terms of your training... Yeah, yeah? Sit still. Huh? It means sit still! When you cease your flow
of animal instincts and harmonize with
the flow of nature, you will be able to sense
Nature Energy for the first time. So I just stay still? That seems easy enough. Naruto, you really don't get it, do you? For animals, not moving is
the hardest thing to do. Jumping, running, molding chakra
with all my strength... I've done those sorts of training. But staying still? I don't quite get it. But that's how you take
in Nature Energy, right? It's impossible to do it right away. This training requires time, since the degree of difficulty
is very high. It's gonna take that long?! Don't take it so lightly, Naruto-boy! Our enemy is Pain,
who possesses the Rinnegan... The power of the
Sage of the Six Paths. A powerful enemy
who killed Jiraiya-boy. With that kind of attitude,
you can't possibly win! I know all that! Pain is the leader of the Akatsuki,
who are after Tailed Beasts. They could come for me
at any moment. I don't have much time to waste. Well, it's not as though
there isn't a better way... There is?! Then teach me that! This waterfall behind me... It's the secret toad oil
of Mount Myoboku. Toad oil? Come over here and
put out your hand. Here. This toad oil has the property
of attracting Nature Energy. It helps with the training. Hey, that's useful! Whenever you rub this oil
on your body, Nature Energy can enter
through there. And gradually, you'll gain the ability
to sense Nature Energy. You're right... I think I feel something
through my skin. It is a tool to help grasp
the concept. In time, you won't even need
to use the oil. However, there is a risk. When used by one who is inexperienced
in controlling Nature Energy, you start to turn into a frog. Wh-Wh-What the hell is this?! Help! I don't wanna be a frog! Oww! What's the big idea? I'm back to normal. It's all about balance. You're used to turning your Mental
and Physical Energy into ninjutsu chakra, so you've got a balance there. But now, you must add
Nature Energy into the mix. Getting the perfect balance
is extremely difficult. Balance, huh? PHYSICAL     MENTAL    NATURE
Take in too little, and you won't
get Sage Jutsu chakra. And yet, if you take in too much, Nature Energy will overwhelm you
and turn you into a frog. Of course, if you only take in
a little too much, it's reversible. But get beyond a certain amount,
and you'll stay as a frog, never reverting back to
a human again. What I meant about you
having to die is that you might stop being human. Once you turn into a frog, then you progress further toward
permanently becoming one with nature. And the past students
who've failed in this training... are those stone statues. All of them? Well, don't fret too much. You have me. And this baton beats Nature Energy
out of one's body. If you start transforming into a frog, I'll beat you thoroughly to reverse it. Speaking truthfully, even Jiraiya-boy wasn't able
to completely master this. When molding Sage Jutsu chakra, Jiraiya-boy always acquired
some frog features. But he was among the skilled ones. I doubt that you'd hesitate
after coming this far, but let me ask you... What will you do? I'll do it! My Ninja Way... is the same as the Pervy Sage's! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... The First Challenge

 We finally got the Six-Tails. Now we can go on the hunt
for the Nine-Tails. Good idea. Because you killed Jiraiya,
the Leaf will set their eyes on you. The more time passes, the more likely they'll set
some plan in motion. Take action before it becomes
more difficult. Pain is invincible... No matter what happens,
we will capture the Nine-Tails. There's just one more Tailed Beast left. Not two? Sasuke has already captured
the Eight-Tails. I see. Konan, make preparations immediately. We're heading out to the Hidden Leaf. Oww! Tomorrow, I'm going to be bruised
and bleeding on the inside. What? Giving up already? Hey, I know a much better
training method. What is it? Use Shadow Clones for the training. They exponentially increase
my progress! You have a point. The experience of the Shadow Clones
reverts back to the original. But the reverse is also true... If a Shadow Clone completely
changes into a frog, it's over for the original. I know that already. Very well. But four is the limit! Any more and neither the baton
or I can keep up! All right! We're not playing a game
of whack-a-mole! This is training! I'm not gonna last doing this! Damn! Oww! My face is like this from being hit! I'm not turning into a frog! What?! Sorry. I never thought that training
to feel Nature Energy would be so hard. Only through perseverance shall
true strength be gained. I know that! If it'll make me strong like
the Pervy Sage, anyone would endure this. No... That's impossible. This training is not for everyone... You could say it's only possible
because it's you and Jiraiya-boy. Or else I wouldn't have even
brought you here. What do you mean? Unless you already possess
enormous chakra inside you, Nature Energy would just take
over you right away. That is how intense Nature Energy is. Plus, they must have the guts
to never give up. That's the kind of person who
can become a Sage. All right! Let's do this then! Fool! Do you want to kill yourself?! I can see it! - Yes!
- It seems he's starting - I can see it! I can see it!
- to get the feel of Nature Energy. - Lord Fukasaku, I'm getting a little hungry.
- I saw it! I saw it! - You're right.
- I saw it! - Naruto-boy, time for a break.
- I'm awesome, yeah! Let's eat. Eat up now. After the break, I'll have you try to lift up
the stone frogs using Sage Jutsu. Y-Yes sir! Good, huh?
They're Ma's special dishes. They're all favorites of mine. That actually tasted quite good. I'm becoming less human, after all. Now then, I want you to
raise the stone frog. But first, try it using only
your ninjutsu chakra. O-Okay. All right! I can't lift it! All right, stop! Now, mold some Sage Jutsu chakra! Right! Good! Now try lifting
the stone frog once more! Okay! Oh! That's it! Naruto-boy! Nice, Naruto! This lad's quicker on
the uptake than Jiraiya-boy. I did it! Fool! How dare you treat your predecessor
with such disrespect! Though he's a lot denser
than Jiraiya-boy too... All right, Naruto-boy! Now put all the toppled stones
back in place! Are you serious?! The Eight-Tails, huh? It seems Sasuke was successful. Pain will bring the Nine-Tails. It appears you've mastered
toad oil assisted control. Now you need to master
controlling Nature Energy without using the oil. I can feel the power flowing into me! Ninjutsu chakra consumes
your internal energy. The more you use it,
the more exhausted you will become. In contrast, Sage Jutsu chakra
draws in external energy, so it will not tire you. In fact, you will recover and
heal quicker too. I get it... Well... With the Nine-Tails' chakra
in the mix too, he's showing a truly remarkable
recovery rate. Now maybe I can do that too... Do what? Huh?! Oh, nothing... Nothing at all! Never mind then... But here. I thought I'd give you
this today, Naruto-boy. What is it? A book. Book? This is the first novel
Jiraiya-boy wrote. A lot of Jiraiya-boy's mind and
heart are contained within it. You should read it. TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA
Tales of...a Gutsy Ninja. Why don't you give it up? This game of tag is getting boring. Give it up. Can I say one thing? I don't care to listen! Die already! Give up... on me giving up! Even if you bring me down, another assassin will attack
the village... As long as we are cursed to
live in this Ninja World, there will be no peace. Then...I'll break that curse! If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! Wh-Who are you...? My name is... TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA JIRAIYA Sasuke said he was going to
sever his bond with me and become stronger. He said I could never understand
his feelings. You were friends with Orochimaru
long ago, right, Pervy Sage? Why did Orochimaru desert
the village and decide to destroy the Hidden Leaf? Orochimaru changed after
his parents were killed. He became obsessed with
the Forbidden Jutsu. Maybe he longed to see his parents... Or he sought revenge
on the Leaf Village, who he held responsible
for their deaths. My parents weren't killed. So like you, I was accused of not being
able to understand. Perhaps he was right, and I didn't understand a thing about him... However... Even I can see there's too much hate
in our Ninja World. Hate? And I've wanted to do something
about this hatred, yet I'm not sure what must be done. But I have faith... that there will come a time when people can truly understand
one another. It all sounds kinda complicated. And if I can't find the answer, perhaps I will entrust you to find it. Yes, sir! I can't turn you down,
can I, Pervy Sage? What? Why are you laughing? Your smile is my salvation. I'm glad I made you my student. R-Really? But I haven't given up yet. PRODUCTION NOTEBOOK
I plan to change this world
with my books! With those books that don't sell? You fool! They'll be bestsellers before
you know it! And when that day finally arrives, I won't autograph your copies
even if you beg me! I don't need any of that! I don't need any of that... 'Cuz Pervy Sage... You gave me
something much more valuable. With so few people,
it sure is taking a while. Shut up! Be quiet and focus. It appears... Sasuke has blundered. An octopus leg! Quit laughing! What's this sensation?

 I don't feel uncomfortable
being still at all!

 Is this what it feels like to become
one with nature?

 I'm not using the toad oil,

 but I can tell power is being gathered
from everywhere!

 I can feel the power surging
inside of me!

 Is this Sage Mode?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Surpassing the Master"

 Tune in again!

 Ow! Owww... Focus! Though it's just a little,
your body is moving! Don't forget, "stay still"! Doing this without using the oil
is a lot harder than I thought. Of course it is! Don't expect it'll be so easy
when you don't use the oil! Not even the slightest quiver! Say, I was just thinking... What is it? Why can't I just take this oil
with me when I fight? Then I won't need to learn how to take in Nature Energy
without the oil. That is impossible. Huh? Why? Outside of Mount Myoboku's climate,
this oil vaporizes immediately. No kidding?! I thought I told you. The oil is only to help you
grasp the concept. Yes, sir! But the way you change
into a frog so quickly... Naruto-boy, you lack concentration! You're not taking it
seriously enough! No, that's not true. After all, I did get the knack of
this thing from the previous training. Enough! Just follow me! Hey... This isn't what
I'm thinking, is it? It's exactly that.
This is your next training site. Stack a stone slab atop that summit
and begin Zen meditation. If your concentration wavers
and you move even slightly, you will fall to the bottom
of the ravine. F-From up there? Hmm... This should do. Follow me, Naruto-boy! Stay still! You must learn to stop
your motion as an animal. Find your own center of balance, and motionlessly synchronize
with nature! S-Saved. Taking in Nature Energy
will have to wait until you first perfect staying still. No way! Oww... Maybe it's time for a break. Damn... It's this hard just to stay still... Isn't this training sorta ridiculous? Such nonsense! Your master, Jiraiya-boy,
managed this feat. Huh? Don't tell me...
Pervy Sage trained here too? Yes. He and I came here often. Thank you, Lord Fukasaku! Say Jiraiya-boy,
how about we call it a day? Nah! I can still keep on going. But... I think I'm on the verge
of grasping it... So can you help me for
a while longer? I must say, he had more guts
than anybody else around. Say, how long did Pervy Sage
take on this training? Well, Jiraiya-boy came here to
train between missions, so it took him some time... I see. Naruto-boy? Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! I don't have the luxury of time. So I have to pick up the pace! Pervy Sage did the same training! So I've gotta do my best too! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Surpassing the Master

 It's no good... Focus, Naruto-boy! That's pretty colorful
and yummy looking. Oh, would you like one, Naruto-boy? It's my favorite, larva riceballs. No thanks! Oh no! Oh... It's looking good.
He's rapidly amassing Nature Energy. He's finally got it! I'm impressed at how far
he's gotten without using the oil. He's displaying the rings around
the eyes. Proof of Sagehood. And no frog aspects either! This might mean Naruto-boy
has become a Sage, surpassing Jiraiya-boy! And it seems he's able to build up even more Sage Jutsu chakra
than when he was using the oil. How does it feel? Hmm... Now I kinda get what it means
to become one with nature. Owwww... Huh? It doesn't hurt that much... And that is Sage Mode! Your body has been activated
on many levels. W-Wow! Sage Mode, huh?! Now that you've mastered
Sage Mode, we've come to the final step. What?! Final step?
You mean there's more?! It's a type of sparring that Sages perform using
Sage Jutsu chakra. Now I shall teach you
how to do Frog Kumite! You are so useless! Why'd you leave behind
my Executioner's Blade?! Shut up, Suigetsu! Just be thankful
we didn't leave you behind! Look who's talking!
You were also passed out, Karin! I got knocked out trying
to protect you guys! It's the result of us trying
to protect each other. We're like fish and water, so close we can't do
without one another. So quit quarreling. Fine. By the way, are we really
going to get the Tailed Beast's power, Sasuke? Hmph. Who knows? But it seems there's no need
to rely on that anymore. Why? I have obtained new powers... Strong enough to destroy
the Hidden Leaf. What's wrong, Sasuke? It's nothing. What is it, Karin? I sense a chakra outside.
It seems we've been tailed. Now, go! Forgive me, Lord Raikage... It appears my tail was unsuccessful. Not only Yugito,
but now Bee too... I cannot believe that Bee
has been taken down! We have been receiving several
messenger lizards from Jay. Once we've pinpointed
the enemy's whereabouts, we'll send in four cells to
rescue Lord Killer Bee, and wipe out the enemy. I heard it was an Uchiha
from the Hidden Leaf who kidnapped my little brother! Why is there an Uchiha
in the Akatsuki?! Sasuke Uchiha... It appears he went rogue
from the Hidden Leaf quite some time ago. Why hasn't the Leaf's Hokage dealt
with this Rogue Ninja?! They were so quick to react
over the Hyuga incident! Something's wrong...
The messages have ceased. Naruto-boy, let's call it a day. No, not yet! I'm the one that can't go on. However...you're starting to
get the hang of it. Yes, sir! What?! What do you mean the messages
from Jay have ceased?! It seems Jay has either
been killed or captured. So we're unable to confirm
the enemy's location. Use whatever information we have
to narrow down the location, and search every inch
of the place! I don't care if you have
to dispatch a battalion! Y-Yes sir. Summon Samui's platoon too! I'm giving them
a document of intent to deliver to the Hidden Leaf stating that we will take care
of Sasuke Uchiha! And have them give us
intel on him! Yes, right away! Furthermore, I'm going to convene a Five Kage Summit Conference
with the Five Great Nations! The Akatsuki will not be forgiven! Omoi, Karui...
Lord Raikage has summoned us. Summoned, eh? What in the world could it be? Maybe there's a crisis... Or maybe... We're getting scolded? Did he find out that my body fat
percentage has spiked? Maybe eating potatoes with
mayonnaise wasn't a good idea? Omoi, you always think too much! Why would he scold you
for something like that?! The most that would happen is you could get sent to
buy some protein. Being around you guys
is so tiring. Makes my shoulders ache. The stiff shoulders are probably
caused by those big breasts of yours, although one can't say for sure. What you thought was just
a stiff shoulder could actually... Will you shut up!
Quit yakking and let's go! You ought to think things
through more carefully. A flat-chested person like you
may not get stiff shoulders, Karui, but... Shut up! Oww! Now that kick will cause... You got more to say?! You two...
If you're ninja, act cooler. Let's go! I pulled it off! Even though it's far from perfect... I need more practice while
in Sage Mode. And, I have to make sure
no one sees me. Jay... We were too late. TO HOKAGE
FROM RAIKAGE Mission acknowledged. I'm counting on you! I knew it...
I had a bad feeling about this. Damn! Don't worry! No way Lord Killer Bee would
screw up like that. It's probably some bad joke. How can you be optimistic?! He could be suffering right
this moment! In fact, he could already... Shut up! I don't want to hear
your pessimistic thoughts! He's our master! We're talking about
Lord Killer Bee here! There's no way he'd be defeated! Aren't you worried about Lord Bee, Karui? Don't get morbid ideas just
because you're worried! Enough, you two! We'll save Bee,
no matter what it takes! We will save him! - Lord Raikage!
- Lord Raikage! Ah! You've made great progress! Nice, Naruto-boy.
That's some jumping power. Your Frog Kumite is
also pretty good! Heh... That's not all! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What? It ain't over!
I'm just getting started! Come at me! The sudden appearance of six figures
shakes up the Leaf Village.

 Cries of fear...

 People fleeing in panic...

 Pillars of smoke arise one
after another...

 Unable to fight back,
the Leaf Ninjas are engulfed

 by the spiral of suffering set
in motion by Pain.

 Amidst the merciless invasion,

 Tsunade is convinced the fateful day
has finally arrived.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Assault on the Leaf Village!"

 NEJI CHRONICLES? Hey everyone! How're you all doing?! Today I brought Neji, who hasn't made
any appearances at all! What do you mean
no appearances?! I'm constantly away
on important missions! Let's see... The last time you made
an appearance was a month... No, six months ago?
Wait, how long has it been? I forgot! I don't do it for

from your squad sure stood out the last time, though. What?! Why those two... Hmph. They have free time
on their hands, unlike a jonin such as myself. Right, it's tough being you. Darn you! Hey, come along with me

 Tune in again!

 That's about it... Scouting complete. Same as usual,
nothing suspicious. It's another nice day. Granny, hurry! Hurry! Now, now. Don't be so hasty. A stick of this after a mission... This is what I live for. C'mon, hurry and pick a card. Byakugan! H-Hey! No fair! You can't use Byakugan
in a game! Well, I guess I'll start on
the next report that's due. Is he from...the Akatsuki?! Right! Must report this
to Lady Hokage! What?! The time has come.

 CIPHER DIVISION


Lord Jiraiya sent back three
sources of information... Namely, a ninja from
the Hidden Rain... Pain's corpse...and... this secret message. Knowing Inoichi in
the Intel Division, he'll be able to get
some kind of information out of the Hidden Rain ninja. Master Shizune has put top priority on the autopsy of Pain's corpse. She's sure to learn something too. And this message we decoded
with help from Naruto... "The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them." We'll have to take all
this information and figure out the mystery behind
this guy named Pain. The mystery of someone who
could even take down Lord Jiraiya. HIDDEN LEAF INTEL DIVISION A genjutsu block... I'm going to take a peek into your mind. So many genjutsu blocks... No wonder truth serum
didn't work on him. How did it go? It's no use... Someone's placed blocks
inside his mind. It's going to be difficult to
navigate past them. It's probably some jutsu placed
on him by the one named Pain. Please be careful, Inoichi. There may be genjutsu traps
set in there as well. Yes, I'm aware of that. AUTOPSY ROOM 3

 These black rods, which
were embedded in the corpse... Could they be a special feature
of these men known as Pain? Why did they embed this
into the body? I must learn more about the properties of this metal
before the autopsy. CIPHER DIVISION "The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them." Maybe the six Pains were genjutsu... A jutsu created by the female
Akatsuki member who was also said to be present. And she's the one who physically
attacked Lord Jiraiya from the shadows. No... That's hard to imagine. According to Lord Fukasaku, Lord Jiraiya died from being
stabbed by real weapons wielded by all six of them. Well, he took down three of them, but they supposedly
resurrected themselves... It does sound like some
unbelievable genjutsu. Common sense has no meaning
when it comes to the Akatsuki. There have been others
who were immortal. In any case, let's keep hypothesizing
all possible scenarios until we get reports from the others. You're right. Let's at least be a little closer
to solving Pain's mystery by the time Naruto returns
from his training. Well then... I'm going to procure us
some fresh ingredients. Not more of that gross stuff...
Aw man... Ma! Make sure you get
some stamina-building stuff! You are able to mold
Sage Jutsu chakra and have pretty much mastered
Frog Kumite and Sage Techniques. Now I have one final thing
to say to you. Wh-What is it?
You're suddenly so serious. Well... It's about the risks of
using Sage Mode. Risks? Yes... Once you fully grasp
the risks involved, then you can use Sage Mode
to its fullest extent! So, what are the risks? First, as you're probably aware, you can't maintain
Sage Mode for too long. Maybe five minutes at most. Also, to amass the Nature Energy
necessary to enter Sage Mode, you must follow the principle
of staying still. Thus, it cannot be used
once you begin battle. For when you are still, you become an easy target
for your enemy. Ow! I see... Right? So the only time you can go
into Sage Mode is when you've got plenty
of comrades around you that can free you up. If you are alone,
but must go into Sage Mode, withdraw from the battle momentarily
and gather Nature Energy. What?! Then Sage Mode is useless! So what was all this training for?! Don't be so disappointed. That is why I am here,
to alleviate that risk. What do you mean? If you and I merge our bodies,
it'll be fine! No!! When I say merge, it simply means to be lightly
attached to your shoulder or back. Oh, that's all... But how does merging
make things fine? Simply put, it's to split
the roles of stillness and action. When one is moving, the other stays still and
gathers Nature Energy. In Jiraiya-boy's case,
the final form of his Sage Mode had Ma and me both
riding his shoulders. I see... I get it now... Don't you worry, Naruto-boy! Okay! From here on, we'll be splitting into two teams:
diversion and search. I'll go over it again. Diversion will be made up
of Shurado, Chikushodo, and Gakido. Search will be Tendo,
Ningendo, and Jigokudo. Konan, you're with the search team. I know. The Hidden Leaf Village... is surrounded by
a spherical barrier that includes underground
and aerial coverage. Which means anyone
who enters without permission is detected immediately. As planned,
we will launch Chikushodo into the Hidden Leaf's aerial space. We will confuse the enemy by not giving them an accurate count. Wait for Chikushodo's summoning. I was told Itachi and Kisame
infiltrated easily. Itachi once belonged to
the Leaf's Anbu Black Ops. He knew the password
to get through the barrier. I have my own way of doing things. Starting here,
the world shall know pain... An intruder! Single target, west gate, sector I-B Hurry, hurry! Yes, I'm coming dear. AUTOPSY ROOM 3

right away! This is beyond the scope

request backup! Hurry! Right! I'll go notify Lady Hokage! He holds no information

 The chakra meter shot up suddenly
and the black rod began warming up, so I thought it was strange. These are demodulators for
receiving high frequency chakra waves. Demodulator?
Which means what? In other words,
they're chakra receivers! And, it's receiving
at this very moment! Receiver? What do you mean? If this is a receiver... I don't have time to explain. I have to notify Lady Tsunade
immediately... CIPHER DIVISION What was that? What's that? Let's go! HIDDEN LEAF INTEL DIVISION Found it! What was that? Choji! I'll notify the Intel Division. Right! I have to get to Pa! Father! The village is... Run! Tami! Cha! Are you all right?! U-Uh-huh. Th-Thank you so much! The centipede is down... Seems that girl did it. Thank goodness!
Your wound is not too deep. Thank you... Sakura! Are you all right? Iruka Sensei... Just what's going on? I don't know. But someone is attacking
the Leaf Village! The situation has been
reported to Lady Tsunade. The alarm should sound soon. The village is under direct attack? Who would do such a thing? Let's go, Iruka! Right! Sakura, hurry to the hospital
and tend to the wounded. It's full of injured people. Yes, sir! It can't be... Miss... It's going to be all right! We have Lady Hokage
on our side! Uh-huh! Barrier Corps reporting! An intruder entered Hidden
Leaf Village through our air space. Our sensors picked up
a single target. But shortly after detection,
several attacks were confirmed. Analysis Corps reporting! Enemy strength estimated
as three battalions in size! A foe capable of organizing
this much military power unnoticed... It must be... Reporting! I have a witness report
on the intruder! He wore black with
a red cloud pattern. The Akatsuki...
So they've finally come. I can't help but hope that
he is the Child of Prophecy. For Jiraiya-boy has entrusted
his all to that child. Sound the state of emergency alarm. And... Recall Naruto! Who do you think you are?!

 Still treating him like a mere child!

 The will of the Hidden Leaf
has been passed on,

 and it's growing!

 Naruto strives to surpass

 What is all this ruckus?! The Akatsuki has begun its assault. Danzo... Is it true about
the Akatsuki attacking?! Yes, the one who has attacked
is Pain, their leader... who defeated Jiraiya. You're saying that he has personally
come after the Hidden Leaf, so soon after he killed Jiraiya? Yes... They've been hunting
Jinchuriki hosts in order to accumulate
Tailed Beasts. It's believed that in addition to
the One-Tail of the Sand, most of the Jinchuriki have fallen
into their hands. Then...their target is... The Fourth Hokage's legacy...
Naruto Uzumaki! And yet, despite the danger, the Fifth Hokage is trying
to summon Naruto back. Such a thing...
is like pouring oil onto a fire! Yes... If we keep listening
to the Fifth Hokage... the Hidden Leaf will be destroyed! What was that?! Stop! You mustn't go outside! Shikamaru! What's going on?! The Akatsuki has entered our territory. Kurenai Sensei, can you step back? Drop dead! Get down! Are you all right? I'm fine. But Sensei,
please use the underground tunnel and go to the evacuation shelter. I'll escort you part way. If anything should happen
to you or the baby, I wouldn't be able to face Asuma. Shikamaru... Huh? Where's Naruto? Can't you tell? Heh? Look carefully! Naruto... I didn't notice him at all. Impressive... Look how far he's come
in being one with nature. Well, that's about it for this training. I gotta take care of some business! Watch out, Lord Fukasaku! Oww... Are you all right, Lord Fukasaku? Jiraiya-boy's eyes were
not wrong. That boy will become even
stronger than Jiraiya-boy! Hey! Hurry and get off me!
You're heavy! Naruto...You idiot! HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Choji! I brought you pills. Thanks. What is...?! Oh, the pain... My leg... What is all of this? Miss Sakura! You're just in time. Please take command. Huh? What about Master Shizune? She's not here. Oh, that's right. She's in
the middle of the autopsy. There are so many wounded, even the Medical Ninja are in
a state of confusion. We need someone to take charge
and give us orders. Take charge?! To be responsible for so many lives... At a time like this,
Lady Tsunade would... Here. Why not eat this
and just do your best? This is for the wounded, not me! If you're able to walk,
please go to the evacuation shelter. Shortly, many more
seriously wounded will arrive! Those who are critical will be red! If treatment can wait,
they are yellow! And those with minor injuries
are green! Tag them with ribbons
and separate them! Y-Yes, ma'am. You're...amazing. I'm going back!
You're in charge here. Yes. Are you all right?

Power to Believe

 All right.
I will return to call Naruto back. I'm counting on you! Stop! Leave Naruto on Mount Myoboku. What?! We understand that
it's the Akatsuki's leader who has attacked our village. How did you find out? We heard it from Danzo. Moreover, they are after
Naruto's Jinchuriki power. So what of it? The last time, we gave you
the benefit of the doubt. But not this time. Naruto is still a child. This is the assailant who
brought Jiraiya down! If Naruto is taken and
the Nine-Tails falls into their hands... Wha-?! What are you doing?! Don't try to protect me!
Naruto, you too, stop! If you die...your dreams,
everything will be gone. Humph... I'm all right. Enough! Move! And run! Until I become Hokage... I'll... never die! I will avenge Pervy Sage! I can't just sit around doing nothing! However...I guess I shouldn't
wallow in sadness. My duty is to be a model
for the next generation and to help them out. For that, I'd happily give my life. I can see that child truly loved
and admired Jiraiya-boy. I can't help but hope that
 he is the Child of Prophecy. For Jiraiya-boy has entrusted
 his all to that child. Y-You... Unhand us, Tsunade! How dare you raise your hand
against us counselors... Who do you think you are?! How long do you intend to
treat him like a child? What?! The will of the Hidden Leaf
has been passed on and it's growing! Naruto is striving to surpass
Jiraiya this very minute! He's not a hidden weapon to be used by the Hidden Leaf
as a deterrent to war! He is a ninja who has sworn
to protect the Hidden Leaf... He is Naruto Uzumaki! Jiraiya, Sarutobi Sensei and
Lady Chiyo of the Sand all had what you two lack. Do you know what that is? Today, I am going to recite
a poem I wrote. I want you to remember it
when you go home. No thanks! I can't memorize
stuff like that. Couldn't agree more. Hey! Naruto! Iruka Sensei! That's all right, Iruka.
They have a point. Ah... I-I'm sorry. Let's see. I won't tell you to
 memorize the entire poem. Nor will I expect you to
understand its meaning. But when you are grown, I want you to think back and
 recall the words of this old man. It's about a way of thinking that is sure to be useful
 to you in your future, and concerns the will of fire. In the place where leaves dance...
The fire burns... The shadow of the fire shines
on the village... Once again, new leaves sprout. Amidst this Shinobi world created
 by us foolish old people... I am glad that
a person like you showed up... The things I did in the past
were nothing but mistakes... But...in my last hour, it seems I shall finally be able
 to do the right thing. The Village Hidden in the Sand and...
The Village Hidden in the Leaves. The future is likely to be different from the way things were
in our time... Your mysterious power
 that Kakashi spoke of... That power is likely to alter
 the future greatly... when you become a Hokage
 like none before... What Sarutobi Sensei and
Lady Chiyo of the Sand had, and what you two lack.
That is... The power to believe! In the same way that
my grandfather, the First Hokage, believed in you and entrusted
the Hidden Leaf to you... It is time for you to believe, and entrust to the next generation! Do as you please. Lady Tsunade! Did you learn anything? Yes! This here! What is it? It seems to be a receiver
for chakra signals. Pain's corpse had these inserted
throughout his body. A receiver?! According to what
Lord Fukasaku said, all six Pains had these stuck
in their bodies and faces. Does this mean that
the six Pains receive some kind of chakra signal through
their bodies, and then take action? That part isn't clear yet. A receiver... Or they use it
to transmit chakra to each other. Something wireless... Also, this has definitely been activated. This must be connected to
the secret of Pain's strength. Together with the data
the Interrogation Corps gathers, we'll figure this out. According to the Intel Division,
the enemy is looking for Naruto. This enemy, who infiltrated the village,
is undoubtedly Pain. Pain... We must tell Lord Fukasaku
of the situation in detail. Messenger frog!
When you go to summon Naruto, relay this message as well. Understood! Shizune, take the data
from the autopsy, collaborate with Interrogation Corps
and figure out just who Pain is! Yes, ma'am! Anbu Black Ops cell B will provide
Shizune with a protective escort! Subsequently, you are to guard
the Interrogation Corps! Do not allow the enemy
to get near them! Yes, ma'am! I will wait for further news
on the rooftop, and I will provide treatment for
all the wounded through Katsuyu. I will use all my power to
protect the village! Let's go! Right! I must rush to Lord Fukasaku too! They are so useless.
All they've done is grow old... So Tsunade persuaded them
to her side instead... But now, the Nine-Tails
can be kept caged up. I'll ask you once more. Where is Naruto Uzumaki? Go to hell! Speak. Is Naruto Uzumaki
in this village or not? Which is it? I-I don't know... This guy... He sucked up the jutsu! Then we'll have to engage
in direct combat. Summoning Jutsu. Starting now, attach yourself
to every ninja and citizen in the Hidden Leaf Village! Take in my chakra and use it
to treat all their injuries! It seems the village is in dire straits. Never mind, just go. I understand. I will protect this village,
no matter what happens! I swear upon my title of Hokage! Are you all right? Tell me where the Jinchuriki
of the Nine-Tails is... Or else, I'll kill you. This crest... I see... So he's from the Akatsuki. Speak up. Naruto... I have no intention of telling
you anything! I see... Then I have no use for you. You create a loud diversion, so that you can investigate
from the shadows, eh? Kakashi! Please take the wounded one
and get away. Leave this scene to me. Roger! Good luck, Kakashi! Now it's just the two of us. Then I'll ask you.
Where is the Nine-Tails? What you're doing is totally pointless. The people of this village are
different from your average village. Even if it means dying, there's not a single
one of us who would sell out a comrade. Pain displays
his overwhelming powers

 by wiping out
the Leaf reinforcements.

 Despite their efforts, the Leaf Ninja
are gradually cornered.

 Those who fight for the village...

 And those who fight to protect
their loved ones...

 As they fight past their own limits,

 what possible strategy
can they make?

Pain vs. Kakashi  

 Over there! Pa! I'm coming too! Let's go! What was that jutsu just now? It felt different from a shock wave... Everything around him
was blasted away, with him as the epicenter. Then... How will you counter this? Not just physical attacks... He can repel Ninjutsu as well?! Impressive. Now then, how should I...? Another one? You're mine! This guy...
He was facing directly ahead, yet... I see... They're eyes are linked! Their field of vision is
connected and shared. When you face Pain,
you must only fight them one-on-one. Remember this well. Each of them can use
only one type of skill. Deducing those skills will be crucial. Lord Jiraiya took on
six of them at once?! I must say... That's crazy...  I get it! That's his ability! Pain... I have no chance
if I fight them alone. I must call for reinforcements, and let them know
what this one's ability is! I have to do as much as
my body can handle! Damn... A Lightning Style Shadow Clone! One down... Kakashi? Actually, I was all set too. But this will help me preserve
some chakra. Thank you. Are you all right? Yes... Well... I'll manage. A Trap Shadow Clone... He had already planted it back then. Until he can confirm
an opponent's abilities, Kakashi always uses Substitute
and Shadow Clone Jutsu. Hasn't changed since
the last time we teamed up. Skilled as always. Which means... Do you have enough chakra? I've already used my Lightning Style
Shadow Clone and exhausted over
half my chakra. To be honest, a drawn-out battle against
a formidable opponent like him is going to be difficult for me. However, I've figured out
a little of his abilities. Pa, he's coming! Almighty Push... There! That's... What did he just do? He repelled all our attacks. Using himself as the epicenter, his jutsu allows him to pull in
or push objects away. Similar to the magnetic laws
of attraction and repulsion... However, it seems he cannot
utilize that jutsu consecutively. I know for certain that
there is an interval of time before he can activate
the next jutsu. Everyone else has been taken down! If he can repel all attacks,
how do we defeat him? The interval between jutsu
seems short too. We can't get close. However, that's our only chance. I have an idea. And I need your help. You move quite well... And you have a wide range of jutsu. People like you need to be killed, or you may pose
a problem later. Now! - Double...
- Human... - Boulder!
- Boulder! Too slow... Kakashi Hatake! He planted this chain underground
before attacking from below! Lightning Blade! Go, Kakashi Sensei! Finish him, Kakashi! The other Pain!
He could still move?! Make it in time! Your inability to move...
doesn't seem faked. I didn't make it... I know that you're not
a Shadow Clone. I shall make certain of your death... It's over. But just to be safe... I will not approach you. Humph... Know pain. The damage is devastating... No... Everyone, let us hurry! - Yes!
- Let us hurry. Let us hurry. Now, hurry. Pa... Kakashi Sensei! I'm done with first-aid treatment. Please finish with the splint. Right... Sakura! One more wounded! Hurry! All right. Please lay him down there. Pa... You tried to protect me... Save the crying for later...Choji... If...you are able to move... report to Lady Tsunade
about Pain's abilities. A counter strategy is imperative! K-Kakashi...Sensei? Reflect later! You must...hurry! Run! But... I... I... Don't let Choza's sacrifice
be in vain! Persistent fellows, aren't you? Damn it... He's still...! He's after Choji! Pa...! Pa... Thank you for everything
you've done. Just you watch! Run! Choji! I daresay with the chakra I have left it's impossible to destroy
his entire body. And...if I use it one more time, I'll exhaust all my stamina
and chakra. My life will be... To entrust this piece of information
to those who still live. This is the best method I have
right now to save the Hidden Leaf! I get it... So...he also...got by...
with that Ocular Jutsu... Well...it seems this is it
for me, too. Obito... Rin... Whatever the village may say... You are a great jonin. I'm about to die... But...I'll become your eyes
and see the future for you. Take care of Rin... Obito... Seems this is
as far as it goes... for me to see the future
 as your eyes. I wasn't able to protect Rin... I keep breaking my promises
 to you. Forgive me. Obito...
Rin... Sensei... I'll...be joining you now. Is that you, Kakashi? So this is where you were... Will you tell me your story? Sure... It's a really long story,
so I want to take my time. Yeah...that's fine. Well... Father... Is something wrong? Lady Tsunade! U-Um... Katsuyu has already attached herself to most of the people
of the village. Sorry. Let us continue... Lady Tsunade! We cracked the ability of
one of our enemies! Tell me. He is male.
Between 25-30 years of age. Distinguishing marks
are piercings, six in his nose and seven
in his ears. His ability is a jutsu that simulates magnetic attraction
and repulsion. He can attract targeted objects
to himself. And he can repel
every ninjutsu attack. Repel?! All of them? Yes! However, once he uses
either jutsu, there is a five-second interval. Five seconds... That's all? You did well to report this! Our sacrifices will
lessen considerably. Pass on this information to
everyone via Katsuyu! - Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am! Team Choza provided back-up
for Kakashi Sensei against two of the enemies... It is believed everyone
except myself perished. Go back to Choza! Take him to the hospital
immediately! He can still be saved. Huh?! Then...Pa is... Yes... Thank goodness! I'm so glad! Kakashi... What about Kakashi Sensei?! Just hurry, Choji... I was told each Pain could
only use one skill.

 Then it's strange...

 Lord Jiraiya defeated the Pain who
can use Summoning Jutsu.

 I saw her when reading
through the Hidden Rain ninja's mind...

 But what's going on?!
She was clearly a corpse!

 Inoichi... Please tell me more
in detail.

 We will uncover
his mystery together!

A Sand... What does this mean? I don't know either... But...he went missing right around
the time Gaara was taken. Could it be that...
he was a spy for the Akatsuki? I don't believe it. He served on the council
for four years... Was he disguised with
the Transformation Jutsu? No. This is a Jutsu of
a much greater level... The Fire Ball Jutsu was created
by the Uchiha Clan and they use it a lot by preference... <i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.</i> And that Jutsu was the real thing. It looks like you're done as well. Yes... I'm out of Chakra... Well, the Chakra we sacrificed
was only about thirty percent... Although it's a Jutsu handy
for creating exact duplicates of us, the quantity of Chakra
we gave them wasn't that much. And the Jutsu they can use
are proportionate to that quantity. But it was more than enough
to buy us time. <i>The Jutsu wore off, huh...?</i> <i>However, we were able
to buy quite a bit of time...</i> <i>This should be enough...</i> <i>Well done, Itachi, Kisame.</i> That's easy to say. The two who became sacrifices and gave up their bodies
for your Jutsu... were both my subordinates. <i>You should be
the one thanking me...</i> <i>With my Impersonation Jutsu,</i> <i>they were both able to become
members of the Akatsuki,</i> <i>although only for a short time.</i> <i>It's almost time...</i> <i>The Secret of Jinchuriki


</i> Damn it! This means the real one
is in the hideout, huh...? I guess we can say his goal was
to stall us and to gather information. Now that we know that,
there's no point in hanging around here. All right! Let's hurry! This way! Just as I thought... They were clearly stalling for time... They've sure got a good Jutsu... <i>I never realized...you were...
fighting against people like this, Naruto.</i> Using a Jutsu like this
to stall us means... they're undoubtedly already
extracting the Tailed Beast! We don't have time.
We must save Gaara right away. - E-Excuse me...
- Hm? What do you mean...
extract the Tailed Beast...? It's likely that they're intention is to create a new Jinchuriki
using the One-Tail, Shukaku. Jinchuriki...? I explained before
how the Tailed Beasts possess a power beyond
human comprehension, didn't I? And how each land attempted
to use them as military weapons. The Jinchuriki...
is what you might call... the one who controls that power. But earlier you said... <i>The Tailed Beasts have
immense Chakra,</i> <i>and in the world of Ninja were
used for military purposes</i> <i>by Hidden Villages around the world.</i> <i>They competed to
get their hands on them.</i> <i>But none was able to control that power
which had surpassed human intelligence.</i> In the end, that is... But in the past, there were those
who attempted to control that power. They attempted to control
the Tailed Beast... by sealing it inside people. By doing so, they tried to suppress
the extreme power of the Tailed Beast and then control that power. And the ones with the Tailed Beast
sealed within them... in other words, people like Gaara
were called the Jinchuriki. The striking feature of the Jinchuriki is how it utilizes unbelievable power
by resonating with the "Tailed Beast." Including Gaara, there have been
three Jinchuriki in the history of the Sand. I'm counting on you. So wars were fought often
using the Jinchuriki? That's right. Then, the people who've
been turned into a Jinchuriki... How can the Tailed Beast be extracted? What's required is
a Sealing Jutsu with the ability... to instantaneously balance
the power of the Tailed Beast, in addition to plenty of time. But if that's done, the Jinchuriki... Don't tell me... That's right... The Jinchuriki that has
his Tailed Beast extracted... dies. The two people I mentioned earlier... The Sand Jinchuriki other than Gaara both had the Shukaku
within them extracted... and died as a result. You're sentimental as always, huh?
Sakura... Don't worry. I'll be saving Gaara! I-I was concerned...about your...! Let's hurry. <i>Naruto...</i> It's from Big Sister, huh...? You shouldn't be moving yet. It's not good for you in
your condition. I'm okay. I can at least walk... More importantly, it seems we've
been contacted by Granny Chiyo. I can't just lie around! I see... So you've heard, huh? As it happens, we've learned
something terrible from her message. Yura was a spy?! I can't believe it... A man who served on the council
for four years wouldn't... But...now it makes sense. How the enemy broke through
the village defenses that easily. And I'm sure nobody imagined a man in charge of security
would be an enemy spy. Here I thought we had thoroughly
checked everyone out when Gaara became the Kazekage! The person in question might've
just been controlled by some kind of Jutsu. More importantly, it doesn't say anything about
the most crucial thing! When's the Kazekage coming back?! Having the Kazekage of one
of the Five Great Shinobi Lands no less kidnapped by some bandits sets
a bad example for the other lands! And it seems one of them
is Sasori of the Red Sand! It'll be a tremendous disgrace
if this gets out to the other lands! If it becomes known that
the Kazekage is missing, who knows when
the neighboring lands will intervene. Our most pressing need is
to immediately elect a new Kazekage... and make an effort to stabilize the village. Gaara could still very well come back! Well, the fact is... it might just be better for the village
if he doesn't come back. What're you getting at? Gaara is an unstable monster
with the One-Tail inside him. We thought he would be easier
to control if we made him the Kazekage... But in the end, there's no telling
when he might go out of control. There's no mistaking he's trouble. Gaara originally resonated with
the One-Tail, Shukaku. But he's an unstable experiment
we can hardly call complete... And he's a failed creation who
was even once ordered for assassination by his own father, the Fourth Kazekage. Right now, some of the younger people
just blindly admire him. But the fact is most of the people
in this village are just scared of him... and have no expectations of him! Just try talking trash like that again! <i>I don't care if you are  on the council.
I won't allow it!</i> Stop, Kankuro! You're before the statues
of the Kazekage! This is a holy place! Kankuro, your anger is understandable. But there's an element of truth
to what he says. But the fact is... this isn't an issue of whether
or not Gaara should be trusted. Something like this happened
before a long time ago... The Third Kazekage was kidnapped. There were all kinds of conjecture in regards to the whereabouts
of the Third Kazekage, war broke out and the lands
were in chaos... If only we paid our attention
towards securing the village, rather than eagerly searching
for the Third Kazekage, that wouldn't have happened. Then why didn't you do that...? The Third Kazekage was
an exceptionally powerful Kazekage in our history. And most importantly,
a body was never found. No one thought someone as powerful as
he could have been killed that easily. Something like that must
never happen again! That's why...we must consider
the best interests of the village! So that's why the borders
are being secured... The village plunged into chaos when the enemy broke through
our border by seizing the opportunity while we were engaged in
the search for the Third Kazekage. Our most pressing need is
to secure the borders. But there was no reason to go out
of your way to send Temari...! Kankuro... What're you saying?! <i>Originally we were going to have
you  take on that mission as well!</i> But then you get yourself poisoned...! If we assign Gaara's siblings
to border patrol missions, the young people won't start talking
about nonsense like rescuing Gaara. Temari was dispatched to a place that's been infiltrated by
the enemy many times in the past. We needed someone of Jonin rank
or higher to go. I know... But... But... Gaara's... Gaara's... my little brother. <i>Zetsu.</i> <i>Dispose of the two we used for
the Impersonation Jutsu.</i> <i>Understood.</i> <i>Itachi, tell me about the enemy's
number and their features.</i> <i>They're a four-man squad with
Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno,</i> <i>and the Nine-Tail Jinchuriki
Naruto Uzumaki from the Leaf,</i> <i>and Chiyo, the Sand's advisor.</i> Did he say Granny Chiyo...? <i>It seems he's still not quite accustomed
to using the Giant Rasengan...</i> <i>It looks like opening the Gate of Joy
has left him quite exhausted...</i> Are you okay, Guy Sensei? What do you mean? I'm always full of energy. Guy Sensei! He's not okay at all! It can't be helped.
He just used the Asakujaku. We should rest somewhere... That's the place! Is there really a point to us
guarding this place? Orders are orders. We'll guard in 24-hour shifts as of now. - Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am! Stop! What is it, Kakashi Sensei? We're going to take a short break here. That's a wise decision. Why?! You're the one who said
we don't have time! If we waste time taking a break here,
Gaara will be...! Compared to right before
we encountered the fake Itachi, our pace has clearly slowed. He's absolutely right. If we rest up here,
ultimately we'll reach our destination faster. And tomorrow, we might
end up fighting the guys... who took Gaara. It's best if we're at full strength. Fine. So this is Kisame's, huh...? He looks to be worth disposing of... Then let's get to it. Right... Now the break is over and
both teams have started off again. Team Kakashi has departed from
point A and Team Guy from point B. They are both charging straight
for the one finish line. They say that Guy and Kakashi
are called the Eternal Rivals. I just can't take my eyes off them. Guy commented before the race
that he would definitely win. That was quite memorable. The two of them are neck and neck
as they head for the finish line. We wait with breathless anticipation
to find out who will control this punishing race
and grab the glory of victory. Next episode: "The Death of Gaara!" So here you are. Naruto-boy, every once in
a while, you disappear. Where do you go? Well...nowhere in particular.
I just wander around... Well, no matter. I want to practice merging starting now,
so come down here. I wonder if they're okay. What do you mean? The Akatsuki want me, right? I'm worried they will come looking
for me in the Leaf Village. What kind of fool are you?! The Hidden Leaf has
many fine ninjas! Stop your unnecessary musings and
concentrate on the work at hand! If anything happens,
the messenger frog will notify us. All right! Let's get on with this merging stuff! Who could have imagined
such destruction? What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Mystery of Pain

 This spells the end of Tsunade's era. However, we cannot allow
the Akatsuki to take Nine-Tails. So I have eliminated that possibility. We will lay low underground
until the chaos dies down. Shouldn't we be assisting? Even if you should assume power,
it would be meaningless if the citizens of
the Hidden Leaf are dead. The princess is now Hokage. As long as she can utilize
Katsuyu's jutsu, the entire village will not perish. Certainly, there will be lives lost. But to me, that is a necessary sacrifice. In order for me to become the Hokage... I win! Nothing tastes better than
a drink of sake after work. No good. Did you find out anything, Tonbo? Not yet... Nothing promising that
is linked to Pain. NO TRESPASSING Today's corpse is light. It's a knack I got
from years of experience. This one's a woman. The highest tower in the village
where we always deliver these bodies... You know what that's for? In a village like ours, isn't it usually where the ashes
are enshrined? They were originally built as
a memorial to honor the dead. If that's the case, why is it off-limits to the relatives
of the dead too? Like I care. What? Stop acting arrogant. Actually... Rumor has it that
Lord Pain lives up there. Really? That's something. But there's no way. It's just a rumor. A rumor... Never mind that. I'm gonna confirm it. Just like you said. It's a woman. Good work. Oh, Lady Angel... Now quickly, bring the next one. Inoichi is really amazing! He can see half this guy's day
in a mere 30 seconds... I can barely keep up! You fool! If you have time to talk, find something that
we can link to Pain! Sorry for interrupting. It's me, Shizune! Lady Hokage ordered me
to come here! Did you learn anything on your side? Yes! I will explain immediately! The information I brought,
along with the data you possess, will reveal Pain's identity! Summoning Jutsu! Each of the Pains had
black rods like this one inserted in their bodies. We believe this is the key
to explaining their power. Could it be that they use this to
transmit chakra to each other? It's a similar ability to
our clan's Hidden Jutsu. The forefather of all ninja, the Sage of the Six Paths,
possessed the legendary Rinnegan. Someone who possesses
the same eye... If such a person really does exist, then it wouldn't be a surprise,
no matter what jutsu he uses. What was that?! It seems they have
shown up here as well. We will stop them. Wind Style: Wind Blade Jutsu! Lightning Style: Four-Pillar Trap! Earth Style... Buta Futa! Well? Did we do it? All right! This completes
the steps to Sage Mode... We'll now begin the merge training! Y-Yeah...! So basically, you're gonna get
on my shoulder, right? Correct. While you move,
I draw in Nature Energy. This is a training to hone
that combination. Now then, let us synchronize
our breathing. Okay... A-Are you okay, old frog? S-Strange... Let's try it once more. Sage Art: Amphibian Jutsu! It seems this is not possible. Not possible...?! I suspect that the Nine-Tails
inside you is rejecting me. No way! Then what was all that training for?! What are we gonna do?! What?! This beast...is growing more heads! Looks like a special type
of Summoning. Rather than fighting the beast, let's find the one casting the jutsu! What should we do, Lady Shizune? As for them... Summoning Jutsu! Wh-What is that?! As I thought... It's here. It seems I made it in time. Lady Katsuyu, thank you so much! Yikes! Forgive me, Lady Katsuyu,
I'm just not used to you yet. It's quite all right. They are powerful Summonings. Everyone, please be careful. There's no mistake... When I looked into the mind of
that fellow from the Hidden Rain... I saw her. But how could this be?! What is it? She was a corpse! And that dead body...
is now using a Summoning Jutsu! It was thought each
of the six Pains uses only one type of jutsu. But something's wrong! Lord Fukasaku said that
 the only one who was able to use Summoning was the Pain
we did the autopsy on! What's going on?! The Pain who was capable
 of the Summoning Jutsu has already been killed
by Lord Jiraiya! Inoichi! Please give me more details. I might be able to figure this out! But in our current situation... Leave this place to
the Anbu Black Ops and me. Get to safety! Ibiki...! Let's hurry, Inoichi! We must uncover
Pain's true identity! We'll head to the Cipher Division
for the time being. Have Ino accompany us
to assist your jutsu. Got it... It's me, Ino. Listen carefully. We are moving to the Cipher Division. Let's go! We shall be your opponents! Why don't you speak?!
You're no fun at all. Humph! If that's your attitude, then I shall make you want to speak! We'll deal with the dog! Combination B! Right. Wind Style! Wind Blade Jutsu! Lightning Style! Four-Pillar Trap! Earth Style, Mud Fall! Lightning Style!
Sixteen-Pillar Trap! Fire Style! Biscuit Firing Jutsu! Summoning! Iron Maiden! Summoning... Torture Chamber! I'll loosen your mouth. And you'll tell us...your secrets. Pain... What a nice name. Pain is the most reliable form
of communication. Let me feel your pain too... Yes... Pain does not lie. Through pain, we are equals... I will share your pain. And I will get to know you
through pain. Now show me...the real you. Now... This one...isn't feeling any pain. And...this cold... It's like...a dead body! Just what is this pain you speak of? The likes of you would
never understand true pain. Summoning Jutsu! Summoning Jutsu! Impossible...! No, Konohamaru!
Why didn't you run?!

 I made a promise, long ago...

 What?

 That someday, I would fight
Brother Naruto

 over the title of Hokage!

 He is my rival!

 So I'm not choosing an escape route!

 Because Brother Naruto won't be waiting
at the end of such a path!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Surname is Sarutobi!
Given Name, Konohamaru!"

 Remember that!

 The documents are piling up. Oh well, I have to cancel tonight's date. Yeah right...
I don't even have a date! Better get back to work... NINJA REGISTRATION FORM


Ninja Registration Form... A lot of this hasn't been updated. Oh, wow! They're all so young. These are photos from
their Rookie Nine days. And look at them now,
in just a few short years. Huh?! My goodness... That child... I have to ask Kenzo to retake it. Huh?! Quit...copying such silly things! Tune in again!

 How dare they turn our village
into a mess! Konohamaru! Konohamaru! Udon! Moegi! Just in time. We're gonna save this village
from this disaster! What? But we just managed
to run away. Brother Naruto is away. So it's our duty to protect the village! Yeah, but there's nothing we can do
against such powerful monsters! I'll just blast 'em with the new jutsu that Brother Naruto taught me! New jutsu?! It's probably the usual
Pervy Ninjutsu, right? No, it's not! Konohamaru! There's a jutsu I want to teach you! What's with you all of a sudden? Well, I... Um... How can I put it? It's time I pass things on to others,
instead of being passed down to. Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Don't tell me he came up with
some awesome Pervy Ninjutsu?! A-Anyway! The jutsu I'm gonna teach
you is on a whole new level! Just hurry up and teach it to me! I wonder what kind of
amazing Pervy Ninjutsu it is. Listen up. First step is "rotation"! Whoa! We're going to add motion, eh?! And next is "power"! Attack with the risqué, eh?! And then finally, there is... There's even more?! Containment! The most points go to
the best expression, eh?! What are you talking about? At first, I also thought
this was a Pervy Ninjutsu... But it's different! With this jutsu, I can go
on high-ranking missions! What kind of high-ranking missions?! At a time like this,
we have things that we must do. She's right, Konohamaru. It's our duty to guide and
evacuate the civilians! We're supposed to evacuate the children
and those who cannot fight, huh? Yes! I'm going to check out
how things are in Block C. Right! I'll check on Block E. Then I'm going to Block B! I'll make sure there's no one
who didn't make it out! Be careful now, Konohamaru! Anyone?! Is anyone here?! Anyone! Help me! Where? Where are you?! Are you all right?! Hang on! How could they do this?! If we can't merge,
I have no choice but to pull in Nature Energy
while I'm moving! And I said that's impossible! I never imagined this would
happen after coming this far. I'm not giving up! If that's what it takes,
then I'll keep at it until it works! But I'm saying it's impossible! I-I'm sorry... I know this is hard to accept,
but it's physically impossible. That code on your back was a message
to me from the Pervy Sage. Yes, I know that. And thanks to you, Naruto-boy, it's become a key to solving
the mystery of Pain-- Not just that. It's also a message for me not to
give up until the very end. But still... I'm Pervy Sage's student. And if that message was
my master's Ninja Way...then I... I have no business whining! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Surname is Sarutobi!
Given Name, Konohamaru!

 Thank you... You'll be all right now. That mark... It's the gang that killed
Uncle Asuma... The Akatsuki! Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it? Naruto?! He's...a member of the village. We would never sell out a comrade! The Will of Fire, eh? What?! If you do not answer my question,
it is over for you. I will ask you one more time. What is this? Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it? I know nothing! So get lost! We don't know a thing! Let us go! I see...
Then I shall pass judgment. It seems you truly did not know. Wh-What's going on?! He didn't do a thing and
yet the guy on the left stopped moving?! What did he do?! Was the chunin fellow killed without being able to defend himself at all? I-I'd better get away from here.
It's too dangerous! Oh no! Is he on to me?! It seems you went ahead
to do as you please! I have no mercy for scum like you! Ebisu Sensei! Now is your chance to
get away, Konohamaru! Where do you think you're looking?! It'll take more than that to kill me! Ebisu Sensei... I must buy some time to
allow Konohamaru to escape! Wh-What'll I do? What'll I do?! How can I...? Good... He got away. I messed up... But I've done what I needed to do. Is Naruto Uzumaki here
in the village, or not? If you know, speak up. N-Naruto? Brother Naruto?! It seems you do know Naruto Uzumaki. Then tell me where he is. I may...not look it... but I do hold the elite rank
of instructor. Naruto is my student. Long ago, I considered him
a nuisance. who stood in the way
of Konohamaru's rise to Hokage. That's what I believed... However, Naruto didn't allow
his cursed fate to discourage him. With unending optimism and
a never-say-die attitude he faced one challenge after
another and overcame them. The important lessons
which I could not teach, despite being an instructor, Naruto taught them to my students. You...have rambled on too long. This is your last chance. Do you know where Naruto is,
or don't you? Answer me! Or else I'll kill you. Naruto... You... You will overcome the death
of your master and carry on his legacy. The strong will you possess
will teach Konohamaru... no, everyone in the village,
many things. Naruto is a member
of the Hidden Leaf! I have no intention of telling
you Akatsuki anything! Ebisu Sensei! I see... Then... Brother Naruto... When people look at me
or call out to me, they only see me as the grandson
of the Hokage. And I'm sick of it! That's why I want the title
of Hokage right now! It's not easy, stupid! You keep harping on about the Hokage. If you want that title so badly... you can have it over
my dead body! Then starting now...we're rivals! One day, we'll fight over
the name of Hokage. So look forward to that day,
Konohamaru! I guess this is the end of the road. I hope that Konohamaru was
able to escape. Die... I'll take you on! I was taught that... there's no shortcut in the world
of the ninja! Konohamaru!
Why didn't you run away?! You have the potential to one day
become a Hokage! Do not waste your life in
a place like this! I made a promise long ago. To fight Brother Naruto over
the title of Hokage... That's what we promised. Brother Naruto is my rival! So I'll never choose to run away! Because Brother Naruto won't be waiting
at the end of that short path! So fast! One thing's certain.
If he catches me, I'm dead. If I'm caught, he'll kill me with
some special jutsu. Konohamaru! S-Sensei! Is Naruto Uzumaki here in
the village or not? Which is it? I get it... So this is what you see
if you get caught. Now, answer me. It seems you truly did not know. I'm starting to figure out...his ability. I don't have a clue! Konohamaru?! B-Brother Naruto... Konohamaru! There's a jutsu
I want to teach you! It's an A-Rank level jutsu in terms
of difficulty to master. I see. Then I shall pass judgment... A Shadow Clone?! Super advanced ninjutsu that combines chakra rotation, power,
and containment... - Rasengan!
- Rasengan! Wh-When did he learn...such a...? I am a genin of the Sarutobi clan, honored with the name
of this village! Surname is Sarutobi!
Given name is Konohamaru! Remember that! Oww! Not just yet! Let's keep on going! This training is not for everyone... You could say it's only possible
because it's you and Jiraiya-boy. Or else I wouldn't have even
brought you here. Unless you already possess
enormous chakra inside you, Nature Energy would just
take over you right away. Plus, they must have the guts
to never give up. That's the kind of person
who can become a Sage. He's so stubborn... Let's take a break, Naruto-boy. Otherwise, I won't be able
to keep up. That's no good!
We have to keep going to make up for the time we spent on
the training up until now! Look, you've never had this kind
of training before. To run and gather Nature Energy, for which the foundation
is being still, is like telling you to look to the left,
when you are looking to the right. What is it? You all push death out
of your thoughts.

 In battle, both sides suffer death,
injury, and pain.

 Feel pain. Contemplate pain.

 Accept pain. Know pain.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Pain to the World"

 Almighty Push! INN OKOSHI MEN'S BATH WOMEN'S BATH This time, for sure,
I'll use my sex appeal to get Sasuke. This should be okay! What's okay? If you insist, Sasuke...
I'll wash your back. No thanks. Aww, c'mon, don't be so boring. This is sheer heaven... What the hell are you doing, Suigetsu?! I'd ask the same of you! Huh?! I just happen to... I mean...well...
None of your business! Damn it...
It was the perfect opportunity. Oh well... At least I got this... Sasuke, have you seen
my toothbrush? Tune in again!

 AUTOPSY ROOM 3 Fang Over Fang! Ma, above you! I know! He used the corpse as a shield. I figured as much. The reports were right. Physical attacks seem
to be his weakness! Then we, the Inuzuka clan, couldn't have asked for
a better opponent! Ma, let's put him away in one stroke! Hold it, Kiba! He is one of the six who
brought down Lord Jiraiya. We're going to be cautious, yet bold. I expect you to fill in for Hana who
has gone to protect the puppies! R-Right! Shino, we’re going to exterminate her
with our full power. Yes. TEA HOUSE

 TEA HOUSE

I'm so hungry! Let's rest a bit.
We’re all tired from the mission. What's the matter, Guy Sensei? Have you noticed large numbers
of birds have been flying away from
the direction of the village? As though they were fleeing. I also have this bad feeling… We should head straight
for the village. What?! Let's go, everyone! Aw geez! Behind you! Six piercings in the nose,
seven in the ear… It’s him. You’re… It's been a long time, Lady Tsunade. You are the last remaining
of the Legendary Sannin. I wish to take a moment
to speak with you. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here — unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, we run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Pain to the World

 Kiba! We'll go with that technique! Yeah… I know! Let's do it, Akamaru! Dynamic Marking! You won't get away! I have control of the situation. I will take care of these two. Got it, thanks! As long as you have
Akamaru’s marking, there’s no place for you to escape! This isn't Pain. Because her characteristics differ
from what we’ve been informed about. Stay alert. Of course. I won't let my guard
down for anyone. Paper Clones… No matter how many clones there are, our beetles will devour them all! This smell… Get away, Shino! The Paper Clones were armed
with Paper Bombs from the start. The real one was already
saturated with water. She used her weakness to
gain an advantage. This one is strong. You are that boy… …from long ago. It seems you remember me. You know him? A little… Who is he? A god who restores order. It seems he's not in his right mind. Naruto Uzumaki…
Where is the Nine-Tails? Who knows…? The hunt for the Jinchuriki is about over. The Tailed Beasts are
no longer equalizers in maintaining the power balance
between the ninja villages. It's meaningless to protect
the Nine-Tails now. So your target is Naruto, after all? The war will begin very soon. Seeds of war exist everywhere,
ready to explode. And we shall control those wars. If you cooperate with us,
we would not be averse to helping you. From the state of this village… You should know what
we are capable of. Don’t underestimate the Five Kages! You terrorists seek to destroy
the peace our predecessors strived
to bring and maintain! Your words fall on deaf ears! Such arrogance! Such chakra… This is the power of the Rinnegan? I've never seen anything like it. I have a bad feeling… Your peace has brought
violence upon us. I will admit that some of the past actions of
the Hidden Leaf were not just. But your actions here
are unforgivable! Be careful of what you say. This is your final warning from a god. Tell me where Naruto is. Speak! We will pour every ounce of power
we have into bringing you down! That is all I have to say! One other thing…
You have made a huge error! What you desire, you shall never get! If you think the Hidden Leaf has what
it takes to protect Naruto, then… Wrong! Naruto…is strong. HIDDEN LEAF CIPHER DIVISION There are six Pains. Each one can only use
one type of jutsu. That woman used Summoning Jutsu. That means the Pain killed by Lord Jiraiya
was resurrected in a different body. And there’s no mistake… that woman was transported to
Hidden Rain’s tower as a corpse. Did that woman's corpse have
this imbedded in her? No… I'm sure she didn't. This proves that Lord Fukasaku
was right. Pain has the power to bring
the dead back to life. Furthermore, he is able to
substitute bodies as often as he wants, and controls them by planting
these black chakra receivers. Then those six Pains are… It's possible all of them are
actually dead bodies. And if they have receivers,
they must also have transmitters. So someone is in the shadows, sending chakra signals and
manipulating them. Yes. The coded message left behind
by Lord Jiraiya, "The real one's not among them…” Perhaps it meant that none of
the six Pains is the real Pain. What?! You mean there are
still others out there?! Exactly. I did anticipate that possibility… But as the worst-case scenario,
I really didn’t want it to be true. And that someone possesses
considerable chakra. They are able to control this
many bodies remotely, this freely, using just their chakra. It's similar to our, the Yamanaka clan’s,
Mind Transfer Jutsu. But normally you can only
manipulate one person with chakra. There are six Pains. Does this mean there are
six others in the shadows? We don't know that. In any case, if this is
a Mind Transfer Jutsu, he has to be pretty close to
the receiver in order to transmit chakra. Otherwise, it would be impossible to
pull off that magnitude of jutsu and attacks. He must be hidden somewhere
close to the Leaf Village. We need to notify
Lady Tsunade immediately, and organize a search party
to find the hidden Pain. What?! How did we not notice him?! Do not make a move… or this woman will die. Damn it! Mount Myoboku… The same jutsu that Father uses! But he was able to search her mind
in seconds without any device?! It seems Naruto is not here. Mount Myoboku. What?! What?! They retreated? What's going on? Mount Myoboku… That is the hidden village of the toads. Well then, lingering here is useless. How did you know? Why you… Lady Tsunade… We should let them retreat and
in the meantime, fortify the village. May I ask you one last question? That chakra in your legs… Was it to counter my jutsu? It seems you've realized my ability. However, all is meaningless
before overwhelming power. You great nations proved
that over the years. You all think that you have
the leading roles in this world, and do not think twice about death. Soothed by peace, you become shallow. If you kill people, you shall be killed. Hatred brings about
this cause and effect. Quit babbling such nonsense. In battle, both sides suffer death,
injury, and pain. And we of the Great Nations
have had our share of pain! Stop finding excuses for your actions! That is laughable. Lady Shizune! Feel pain. Contemplate pain. Accept pain. Know pain! Wait, Pain! Accept pain. Know pain! He’s still planning something? One who does not know pain cannot
possibly understand true peace! Bad news! Lord Fukasaku! What is wrong? Big brother Kosuke, our messenger,
has been killed. What?! His name… AMACHAN    GAMASPEED    GAMAKOSUKE

vanished from the register. AMACHAN    GAMASPEED                

 Does that mean something has
happened to the Leaf Village? What?! Naruto-boy, I have a bad feeling. Geezer Sage… Don't tell me the Akatsuki
attacked the village! Luckily, Ma went to gather provisions
and is near the Leaf Village. She will be capable of summoning
strong warriors, including us. Get ready now! Right! LEAF HOSPITAL Damn it… I won’t get to all of them like this! Lady Shizune! What?! What's going on? I’m going to use that jutsu. What? They seem to have retreated. Yes… But it doesn't make sense. Lady Shizune… Their scents are completely gone. They’re not around here. I guess my power scared them off! Leave it to Ma…
Just like that time with Pa. What does this mean? It’s hard to think they would just retreat. Pain… One who does not know pain cannot
possibly understand true peace! They intend to do something… Something? I don't know. But it's something huge! I'm counting on you! Make sure Ma gets the message! Yes, sir! Katsuyu! Protect everyone! Lady Tsunade! Something terrible is about to happen! What is keeping Naruto? I must get word to her immediately. That's coming from the Leaf Village. Oh my goodness… Lady Shima! I came through
the distance teleporting pool. I have a message
from Lord Fukasaku. To summon them, eh? Pain! What do you intend to do?! You can't! That jutsu will shorten your life! The power of the six is… You’re really going to do this,
aren’t you, Nagato? I will never forget Yahiko's pain. And now… This world shall know pain. Summoning Jutsu! Almighty Push… Wh-What is this? How could this hap— Naruto… Hurry… Please, Naruto!

 There’s no need for the Leaf’s Hokage
to bother herself

 with the likes of them.

 You just sit back and
sip some tea, Granny.

 I’ll take over from here.

 Tell everyone in the village
to stay out of the way.

 It’ll be difficult to fight while
trying to cover for them.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“Explosion! Sage Mode”

 Let’s settle this! Tune in again!

 And now…
This world shall know pain. Almighty Push… Wh-What is this?! How could this hap— Naruto… Hurry! Please, Naruto! Where are we anyway? Where is the enemy? What's going on, Ma?! Why didn't you Summon us
to the Leaf Village? This is the Hidden Leaf Village. What do you mean,
Granny Shima?! Look carefully around you. It can't be…! And it's obvious who did this. I sense the same energies as when
we rode atop Jiraiya-boy’s shoulders. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here — unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, we run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Explosion! Sage Mode

 Lady Tsunade, are you all right?! Yes… Wh-What is this? You will not get away with this… You will not get away with this, Pain! The mark on her forehead is gone! She has already released
her Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu and given all her chakra
 to Lady Katsuyu. In order to protect the villagers
from this Pain’s jutsu… She can no longer… Are you all right, Iruka?! Forgive me. It took everything…
just to cover you all. You are not to blame, Lady Katsuyu. I just hope everyone else is all right. Lady Shizune… Pa! Choza is all right. Thank goodness. Kakashi Sensei… Pa… You tried to protect me… Save the crying for later…Choji. If you are able to move… report to Lady Tsunade
about Pain's abilities. A counter strategy is imperative! Kakashi Sensei,
your last mission orders… I-I com… I completed the mission, Sensei! Damn! Hang in there, Kiba! Ow! This is nothing. Are you all right, Lady Hinata? Yes, but Ko, you’re injured. If anything should happen to you during
Lord Hiashi and Lady Hanabi’s absence, I will be dishonored for life. You need not concern yourself
with me. But I must! If everyone is injured while
the head of the family is away, I will be the one scolded. Lady Hinata… Still…this attack is… Are you all right, Shikamaru?! Yeah… But what's going on?! You okay, Shikamaru?! I made it out, but my leg’s broken. You should consider yourself lucky if the only thing you suffered in
this attack was a leg injury. Actually, Shikamaru… shielded me. And that's how he got hurt. Come on,
this is no time for tears. They possess this kind of jutsu,
but didn't use it from the start. Which means, they had a purpose. And they fulfilled that purpose, so they changed from guerilla tactics
to an all-out offensive. Who's "they"? Someone who can do this
much damage to the Leaf Village… The only one I can think of
is the Akatsuki. I agree…and their target
is none other than… Yeah… Naruto Uzumaki! N-Naruto?! Yes… I'll never have enough lives
if I rely on luck alone. Still, I'm one lucky guy. If you care enough to shed tears, then pray we don’t get hit
with another one. Naruto… That's… It’s Naruto! Naruto?! You saved us the trouble
of looking for you. Why are you being so reckless? This is…my justice. The effectiveness of the jutsu when all the chakra is concentrated
in Tendo is great, but it also increases the risks. Not only that, the other five
are recovering much slower compared to the last time
this jutsu was used. From here on out,
I'll be looking after you. No more Paper Clones. Summoning Jutsu! Looks like all six have assembled. Tsunade? I am the Fifth Hokage! Lady Hokage! You trampled on the jewel,
the dreams of my predecessors. I will not forgive you! I will settle this now as the Hokage! It appears you now understand
a little about pain. However…my business is not with you. My business is… With me! There’s no need for
the Leaf’s Hokage to bother herself with
the likes of them. You just sit back and
sip some tea, Granny. Naruto! What happened?!
I can’t tell from here. It was amazing! He took down
one of the Pains in one swoop. Naruto…you… Gramps… Doesn’t he remind you
of those two? You’re right… It seems Naruto-boy has
surpassed his predecessors. Naruto Uzumaki. Let’s settle this! Tendo’s power won’t return
for quite some time. In which case… Gamakichi! Take Granny Tsunade to
someplace safe! Gotcha! Granny, I’ll take over from here! Tell everyone in the village
to stay out of the way! It’ll be difficult to fight while trying
to cover for them. Understood. But take Katsuyu.
I know she'll be useful to you. She has intel on them. Katsuyu-girl… Keep yourself hidden
in Naruto-boy's clothes. Yes, sir. Now may not be the right time
to ask a question like this… But now that I've mastered
Nature Energy… I'm able to sense everyone's chakra. Is Kakashi Sensei on a mission
away from the village? I see… Go, Gamakichi! Summoning Jutsu. Master! Lady Tsunade! Sakura… Everything is okay now. Yes… Thank you, Lady Tsunade. Summoning Jutsu! – Sage Art! Frog Song!
– Sage Art! Frog Song! Shadow Clone Jutsu! – Sage Art! Giant Rasengan!
– Sage Art! Giant Rasengan! Bunta-boy! Ken-boy! Hiro-boy! Right on! Naruto! Ninjutsu won't work
on the Pain standing before you. He will absorb all your ninjutsu attacks. Then we'll go with Frog Kumite! All the Pains are visually linked! A blind-spot attack is meaningless unless you move out of the line
of view of every one of them. Well then… I'll show them
an attack they can't see. You little mutt! Take that! Down with you! He's falling. You see, I’m ungraceful. Stay still, you mutt! I thought we dodged it… Frog Kumite utilizes
the Nature Energy around you. The energy became part of
Naruto's body when he attacked Pain! In Sage Mode, both threat perception
and attack range are enhanced way
beyond the ordinary. No time to waste here! I’ll finish this with my new jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I see… So you have become a Sage… mastering the same jutsu
as Jiraiya Sensei. Jiraiya…“Sensei”? I also learned jutsu from Jiraiya. He was once my master… Which would make us sibling disciples. Sharing the same master, you and I should be able to
understand one another. Our master desired peace. Shut the hell up! Such massive chakra… Did you teach him that, Pa? No… I'm seeing it for
the first time too. He never showed that
during our training. What is Naruto-boy planning to do? What is that jutsu? What is it? Naruto's chakra is forming into…
Yes, almost like a shuriken. Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken?! Naruto! All that you've done here… Where's the "peace" in that?! You're only looking at the tree,
not the whole forest. You don't know
the true meaning of peace. So let yourself be captured. Your death will lead to peace. I told you… to shut the hell up! He threw it! What is that?! Pa! The boy’s no longer in
Sage Mode.

 It’s risky, but we must merge
with him now!

 We can’t! You see, the Nine-Tails
prevents us from merging!

 Then what are we going to do?!

 Naruto-boy came up with a way
only he can pull off!

 And that’s what
we’re about to do!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“Danger! Sage Mode Limit Reached”

 I’m counting on you, Geezer Sage! Man… Who’d have thought you'd
master Wind Style? What makes you say that? I was just thinking… Yeah, who would have
guessed back then? Huh? The Wind Style? It has a nice ring to it, y'know. All right! I'm absolutely
gonna master it. Yeah right. You can't even
clone yourself yet. Shut up! Damn it! Actually, I can use it. Watch me. Here I go! Wind Style! Great Suction! See? What kind of Wind Style is that?! Even I can do that. Here I go! Wind Style! Fart! You idiot! Why? Idiot, idiot, you’re an idiot! Tune in again!

 I thought we dodged it... No time to waste here! I'll finish this with my new jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I see... So you have become a Sage... mastering the same jutsu
as Jiraiya Sensei. Jiraiya... "Sensei"? I also learned jutsu from Jiraiya. He was once my master... which would make us
sibling disciples. Sharing the same master, you and I should be able to

not the whole forest. You don't know
the true meaning of peace. So let yourself be captured. Your death will lead to peace. I told you...to shut the hell up! He threw it! What?! When did he learn to hurl chakra with
such high rotation and density?! This is the result of
the other training I did! It expanded! Summoning Jutsu! Deidara was right. He does not listen. What was that? What's going on? Who's fighting them?! It's Naruto. Naruto?! Naruto is back? Yes. He has mastered Sage Jutsu
and is now fighting Pain alone. What?! Damn this leg! Please stay here. Naruto has asked us not to interfere. He's so full of himself! Look what they did to this village! There is no way
he can take them on by himself... No. If he's mastered Sage Jutsu,
he's in a class of his own now. Staying out of the way is
the best teamwork we can offer for him. Sit tight, Shikamaru. Damn it! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete Someday... koete Danger!
Sage Mode Limit Reached

 Please be careful! The more you strike,
the more it will divide in numbers! Why didn't you tell me sooner?! You see... I'm ungraceful... Oww! So how do we handle this?! We must ungracefully endure it for now... Chief... You're slowing down. It seems your Sage Jutsu power
is decreasing. Did you use up your Sage Jutsu Chakra
with that last jutsu? Oh no... I'm about to lose Sage Mode! I have to bring this guy down
before Sage Mode runs out! Ma, you know what to do! We're going to break the Rinnegan link! Got it, Pa! Bunta-boy! Boss! Listen up. I'm going to hurl you
straight at Naruto-boy! Hurl...me? But why, Boss? Listen carefully to
what I'm about to tell you. Ready, Pa? Sage Art! Wind Style: Sand Dust! Where is he?! Rasengan Barrage! Inside its mouth?! You've exhausted your Sage Jutsu. Even in Sage Mode,
two Rasen Shuriken are my limit. Pa! The boy's no longer in Sage Mode! I know that! It's risky, but we must merge with him now! Except we can't... Now is my chance. What?! You mean we can't merge with him
because of that Nine-Tails?! It seems that way. Then what are we to do?! Naruto-boy came up with
his own unique solution. That's what he's about to do! You little scamp! Why you... Damn it! Damn! This way, Naruto-boy! Hand it over! I'll do it! Bring it on! Stay back, kid! I'll get him! I'm going to enter Sage Mode! What?! Get back, Chief! I don't want you guys to get caught
in my Rasen Shuriken! Acting all tough now... I can replenish Sage Chakra
two more times. That means I have four more tries
with my Rasen Shuriken! I have to settle this within that time. Let's do it, Naruto-boy! Reverse Summoning Jutsu! It's been summoned! Now release your jutsu! What? What's going on? It's simple. Naruto-boy prepared
his Shadow Clones beforehand, and had them build up
Sage Jutsu Chakra while standing by. Then he can summon them
through the scroll anytime from Mount Myoboku. Once summoned,
he would undo the Shadow Clone and the Sage Jutsu Chakra
is restored to the original. I see. That is a way indeed! All right! You're mine! Wh-What is this?! That's right. This is the one that absorbs ninjutsu. But I thought we already
took care of him. What is that? It seems that Pain
is the key player. The one Geezer Sage spoke of... The one who can resurrect the dead? He must be the Pain
who possesses that power. That is why when they lined up
in formation... that Pain stepped back to take
the rearmost position of the troop. And the most troublesome Pain
is the one on the left. He can repel all jutsu and attacks,
and pull things toward him. He hasn't shown his powers yet, which is suspicious. Perhaps, for some reason, he's not able to utilize
his powers yet. Either way... We have to get rid
of the guy in the back! Along with some Smoke Bombs! All right! It's useless. What you absorbed was
a Transformation Jutsu! Bastard! You're the original?! You can't dodge this! This time, I got you for sure! My power has finally returned. He repelled the kid's Rasen Shuriken! It's not over yet! Sage Jutsu! Rasengan Barrage! What?! All right! Way to go, kid! Two more left! But...what did that kid just do? Back there, the first Rasen Shuriken was a transformation by
Naruto-boy himself. That Pain was unaware of that
and tried to absorb that jutsu. I get it.
So that's why Naruto appeared. Pain can only absorb ninjutsu. So he took a direct hit when
Naruto tackled him. I see... The three-stage attack
was for that purpose. Back there... He had already slipped into
the smoke and jumped up above. Just barely in time... Almighty Push! Are you all right, Naruto-boy?! Yeah... Damn it! What was that jutsu just now?! It seems the core Pain's power
has returned. You mean, him? No doubt he used the same jutsu
to blow up the village. The more power he uses, the longer the interval before
he can use the next jutsu. So that's why he couldn't use that
repelling jutsu until just now. What are my options? Ninjutsu and taijutsu won't work. Choji brought us information. The minimum interval between
Pain's jutsu is about five seconds. You must target and strike
during that interval. Only five seconds? You'll have to trap him with genjutsu. But how?! I suck at genjutsu! We'll do it! Just like before. Just like before? Yes. During the battle
between Jiraiya-boy and Pain, that was our means of escape. There's nowhere for you to escape now! Almighty Push... Chief Toad! Damn it! This is the farthest
Pain has ever been pushed.

 But rest assured.

 You will not be killed.

 You are a precious Jinchuriki.

 Indeed, Sage Mode is trouble.

 But this way, you are helpless.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Nine-Tails, Captured!"

 I'm losing...power... It's hard to believe Manda
has passed away. I never liked that guy
even up until the very end. I remember people used to
call us "The Three-Way Deadlock." Maybe I will miss him a little... "Three-way Deadlock"? That literally means
that frogs fear snakes, snakes fear slugs,
and slugs fear frogs. Wait?! That makes our current situation... Pops, toss me some
good escargot, will ya? Escargot?! I'll try... But I am ungraceful, you see. Yikes! O-Oh no! I just remembered
some urgent business. I must be going... H-H-Help! What's with her? I don't know...
I'm ungraceful, you see. Tune in again

 What is that?
What is going on?! Naruto is fighting Pain right now! Naruto?! Fighting?! By himself? Yes. We are told not to interfere. Then all we can do is
have faith in Naruto. Naruto... There's no mistake!
It's definitely Naruto! He's fighting alone! No, Lady Hinata! But Naruto is risking his life
for our village! If you enter such a battle,
you will only get in his way and put him at risk! Naruto... What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Nine-Tails, Captured!

 Damn it... He even took out
Chief Toad and the others! Hey! We must hurry and
launch the genjutsu. Performing a duet before everyone
is so embarrassing. Quit complaining and do it! I know already! This genjutsu requires an enormous
amount of Sage Jutsu Chakra. In other words, it will take a little time before
the jutsu activates. I'm gonna go for that
five-second interval! As soon as you take in
enough Sage Jutsu Chakra, start the genjutsu! Remember... You only have
one Shadow Clone left to take in Sage Jutsu Chakra
for you, Naruto-boy. Once that's gone,
it'll be impossible to fight while taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra,
as it requires you not to move. And your Sage Mode will
run out in five minutes. Using Shadow Clones to
help you maintain stillness and take in Sage Jutsu Chakra
was a good idea. But why didn't you make
more of them? It's like trying to look to the right
and to the left at the same time. We've divided the task, but taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra
is extremely difficult. At Naruto-boy's current level,
two Shadow Clones was his limit. On top of that, I can only produce
three Shadow Clones for battle. Any more would interfere with
those taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra. I see... Either way, prolonging things
isn't to our advantage. You are strong indeed. This is the farthest Pain
has ever been pushed. However... Universal Pull. That's enough. Forgive us, Naruto-boy!
Just hang in there! Naruto... Don't worry. I won't kill you. You are a precious Jinchuriki. Hah, it doesn't hurt at all! Don't underestimate
my Sage Mode! Now it's my turn to... You are right. That is a problem. What's happening?
I'm losing power... I get it! This guy is sucking out
my Sage Jutsu Chakra! Capture of the Nine-Tails,
accomplished. Just a bit longer and
we'll be able to use genjutsu. Hang in there, Naruto-boy! You don't have me...yet. Quite tenacious, aren't you? So that's how it is. Well, it's just perfect since
 I can't move. So you've finally resigned yourself. You know, Nature Energy is
really hard to control. What is this? I see... That Pain underwent
a petrified frog transformation from absorbing too much
of Naruto-boy's Sage Jutsu Chakra! Sage Jutsu Chakra has its risks,
after all. Now, it's just you... Well...not quite. What do you mean? These Pains are puppets. There is another manipulating
these Pains. The real Pain. The real Pain?! All right, we're ready. Let's do it, Ma! Gotcha! Pa! Geezer Sage! I've had enough of
that genjutsu. Shikamaru! Ino! You're alive! Yes... But...Lady Shizune... What?! You mean... Aw dammit! Oww...! Every bone in my body is broken! I see... Is that what happened? If we had been more diligent,
this would never have... We can't let Lady Shizune's death
be in vain. We'll unravel the mystery
she tried to solve, and find the real Pain. You can whine
after all this is over! Shikamaru...
Can't you say it to her nicer? No, he is right, Shikaku. The way to make ourselves useful is to find the location of the real Pain
as soon as possible. Inoichi, you're a skillful jutsu user. Are you able to pick up
the enemy's chakra and trace his whereabouts? I already tried. But the enemy is constantly
changing their chakra frequency. A trace back is impossible. Pain is quite adept. Pa! Bastard! Universal Pull. Has this tamed you a little,
Nine-Tails? What are you?! Just what do you want?! Why are you doing all of this?! Why, you ask? Things always happen
without warning. And the reason becomes
apparent afterwards. This situation... Perhaps I will explain to you. Use Katsuyu as a medium and
gather every piece of data available from those who have
encountered Pain. The dead may have left
some information as well. Even if we have to haul dead bodies,
find out all we can! Haul dead bodies... Wait... I think I know where
to find the real Pain! What do you mean? Did you figure something out? Yeah... Back when I looked into
the mind of the Hidden Rain ninja who was captured by Lord Jiraiya... His duty was to deliver bodies
with his partner. It's a knack I got from
 years of experience. This one's a woman. The highest tower in the village
where we always deliver these bodies... Deliver bodies? Yes... Your earlier remark
triggered my memory. Now listen... First of all, it's basic knowledge that
one who transmits chakra signals must be as close to
the receiver as possible. And... Of the several towers that exist
in Hidden Rain Village, this man was delivering bodies
to the tallest tower. It was rumored in
Hidden Rain Village that Pain could be found
in the tallest tower. Actually... Rumor has it
that Lord Pain lives up there. And the woman who appeared as Pain... She was the same body
as the woman who was delivered to
the tallest tower. So this tower was the laboratory where
those black rod-like Chakra Receivers were implanted into corpses
to create the Pains. And how is that connected to
the real Pain's whereabouts? The best spot to send out
chakra signals... It had to be the tallest tower
with the widest and farthest reach. I see... That means... the real Pain is in the highest spot
close to Leaf Village. All right! So we'll search
every single spot that is at a high altitude! You asked me why I am
doing all of this. Even if I told you why,
I doubt that would change anything. But what if we tried to have
a discussion once more? I have nothing to discuss
with you. My goal is something even
Jiraiya Sensei was unable to achieve. As I mentioned earlier... Creating peace,
and bringing about justice. Peace? Justice? Yeah, right... Don't give me that crap! My master! My sensei! My friends! My village! After everything you've done, don't you dare talk about
peace and justice! Then tell me what your goal is? I'm gonna kill you! And bring peace back
to the Ninja World! I see... That is noble of you. That is justice indeed. However... My family... My friends... My village... They suffered the same fate
as this village, by you Hidden Leaf Ninjas. How is it fair to only allow you people
to preach about peace and justice? What are you talking about?! The Land of Fire and the Hidden Leaf
had grown too big. To protect its national interests, it forced feudal clans to wage war
against each other, and profited from it. Otherwise, the nation and the people
of the villages would have starved. However, our little nation and
its villages became the battlefields for the Great Nation's war. And each time, our nation was ravaged
and laid to waste. After all the fighting subsided, things stabilized in the Great Nation. And our little nation was left
to suffer the pain and misery. You and I seek the same thing. We are trying to establish the peace
that Jiraiya Sensei so desired. You and I are not different at all. We each act according to
our own sense of justice. The justice I delivered
to the Leaf Village is no different from what
you are trying to do to me. The pain of losing something dear
to you is the same. And both of us know
that pain all too well. You have your justice... And I have mine. We are both ordinary men, driven to seek vengeance
under the banner of justice. However, if there is justice
in vengeance, then justice will only breed
more vengeance. And trigger a cycle of hatred. We are living in the middle of
such a phenomenon right now. We know what the past
has been and we can predict what
the future will be. That is history as we know it. So we cannot help
but believe that human beings are incapable
of understanding each other. The world of the ninja
is ruled by hatred. However... even I can see there's too much
hate in our Ninja World. Hate? And I've wanted to do
something about this hatred, yet I'm not sure what must be done. But I have faith that
there will come a time when people can truly understand
one another. It all sounds kinda complicated. And if I can't find the answer,
perhaps I will entrust you to find it. Yes, sir! I can't turn you down,
can I, Pervy Sage? How would you confront this hatred,
in order to create peace? I want to hear your answer. I don't have an answer... to something like that. I formed the Akatsuki in order
to stop this cycle of hatred. I can put an end to it. For that...I need the power
of your Nine-Tails. I will use the power of
every Tailed Beast to create a Tailed Beast Weapon, many times more potent than
the power that destroyed this village. A power enough to wipe out
an entire nation instantly. A Tailed Beast Weapon?! The world will know real pain. The fear instilled by that pain
would prevent wars. And the world will be on
the road to stability and peace. But that kind of peace... It's nothing but a fake! Humans are not the most intelligent
of creatures. This is the only way that
peace can be achieved. And after several decades, that pain too will
eventually fade with time. It will no longer be a deterrent and humanity will begin to
battle once more. This time, they themselves will
use the Tailed Beast Weapon against one another and
reconfirm what true pain is. And then peace will be
restored again, for a time. In the course of
this endless cycle of hatred... Pain will give rise to
momentary peace. That is my dream. Nagato... Try not to push yourself. You've already spent
so much chakra. Peace is right within our grasp. I'm here because I want to be.

 Always crying... Always giving up
before even trying...

 Taking the wrong paths
so many times...

 That's who I was.

 But your smile is what
saved me, Naruto.

 That's why I'm not afraid
to protect you.

 Even if...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Confessions"

 I will protect Naruto! NARUTO THEATRE Hinata! Oh, Sakura. What's the deal with the new ending? Huh? What do you mean? How can you oust me, the heroine, and have the ending to yourself? I-I don't know anything about... This is what I'm talking about! Don't tell me you bribed the staff? I-I wouldn't do such a thing! And "bicycles"?
If you're a ninja, run! Give it up, Sakura. Naruto! There are fans of Hinata
on the staff of Naruto. I'm told they went out of control
this time around. What's that supposed to mean?! And just listen to this song! Throughout it they keep
repeating "bicycle"! Even the brightest animators
have no choice but to put her on a bicycle! Oh, that makes sense... That's not the point! Hey, staff people!
Make an ending credit with me in it! You hear me?! Cha! Tune in again!

Now get this! I'm absolutely gonna
be named the Hokage! You just watch, everyone! That boy. He's... The awful Nine-Tails... Hey, that topic is taboo. Nine-Tails? What's the Nine-Tails? It's something you do not
need to know, Lady Hinata. But...you must not go near that boy. Naruto... You argue that my vision
of peace is a fake. But in this cursed world,
there is nothing more fictional than a peace where people can
truly understand one another. But I have faith that there will come a time when people
can truly understand one another. Pervy Sage believed that the day
would come when people truly understand
one another. You're wrong! Empty words... What can you do when you can't
even back up your answer? All you are good for... -...is giving me the power
-...is giving me the power of the Nine-Tails. Like I told you earlier... your death will lead to peace. Confessions

 I want to grow up to
be a great ninja... strong like Father and kind like Mother! Lord Hiashi is very strict because he has high hopes for you. One day, you will enter
this Academy too, Lady Hinata. I wonder if I'll make it... Of course you will.
So you must do your best. That boy... Lady Hinata, please don't associate
with him. But why? It's time for your training.
Let's go back. Naruto... What's wrong, Neji? That's Lord Jiraiya's Summoning Frog. What?! So the real Pain will be
at the highest spot, somewhere near the Leaf Village. All right, let's search every single site
that is at high altitude! Work in teams with
at least two people per cell. And if you find the real Pain,
do not engage him carelessly. Try to include Sensory-Type ninja
in the search teams. It'll be faster. All right. Shikamaru, stay here with Shiho
and wait for word from us. I guess I have no choice
since I can't move. Okay, Katsuyu. Get word of this to every
able survivor in the village. We'll need their help. Yes, I understand. I want to become a great ninja... strong like Father and
kind like Mother. A great ninja... strong like Father... Lady Hinata! Hey you! I-I'm sorry! Hey...she's the Hyuga kid! Yeah, she's got the eyes! She must be that Neji's cousin. She's probably cocky too. She thinks she's better than us
'cuz of her family and talent! I-I'm not like that at all... Hey you! Trying to run off without saying
you're really sorry? What a jerk! Don't let her get away with that! Hey, say you're sorry. Apologize nicely. Say you're sorry! I'm sorry... Not good enough!
Say it like you mean it! Apologize! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I can feel...
Pain's chakra coming inside... I've avoided any vital spots
and kept them shallow. But you will no longer be able
to move on your own. Snap out of it, Lad! No matter what he says,
you must not listen! You're the Child of Prophecy! The savior of this world! Jiraiya-boy and Pa sacrificed themselves
because they believed that! So you cannot lose! If you give up now,
I won't forgive you! Noisy frog. Bastard! I guess I'll be taking you now... Lady Hinata! How cruel... Restricting Naruto's movement
with those poles. I won't let you hurt Naruto anymore! Reinforcements? Why'd you come out here?! Get away quickly! You're no match... I know. I'm just being...selfish. What are you talking about?! Don't put yourself in danger like this! I'm here because I want to be. This time... I'm going to save you, Naruto. I was always crying,
and giving up before even trying. I made the wrong turns
so many times... But you helped me find my way
and take the correct path, Naruto. I always chased after you. I wanted to catch up to you. I wanted to walk
beside you all the time. I want to be at your side, always. You changed me, Naruto! Your smile is what saved me! That's why I'm not afraid to die... if it means I can protect you! Because... I love you, Naruto! What? Hinata! I can't get near Naruto... I must do something! I can't let it end like this. If there's even the slightest chance... Gentle Step... Twin Lion Fists! Nagato! Now's my chance! One more time! Hinata! Cut it out. What do you want? Hey, he's the kid! That one who's always getting
into trouble. The one everyone hates! Oh, yeah... That guy. That guy, huh? I'm not "that guy"! My name is Naruto Uzumaki! I'm gonna be the Hokage one day. Remember that! - Hokage?!
- Hokage?! Are you crazy? That's a bunch of baloney! What a stupid kid! There's no way an idiot
like you can be one! Wanna fight? Better not regret it, guys! What seal is he weaving? Clone... - No way!
- No way! Jutsu! That was terrible... Don't make us laugh! Caught you off guard! How's that?! I will! I'm absolutely gonna
become the Hokage! And I'll prove you wrong! Why you... Don't take us lightly! Lady Hinata! Run! Lady Hinata... Are you all right? This boy... Come on, Lady Hinata. Wait... He came to my rescue... You must not get involved with him. Let us go. B-But... Hinata! Hinata! Hey! Damn it... Hinata! Hinata! Stop... Don't come, Hinata. I'm not running away! It's impossible to change yourself. Sure she can! Don't go deciding
what a person is like! Go, Hinata! I always thought you were
so negative, hesitant, and weird. But I kind of like people like you. I don't understand. Why would someone weak
like you try to resist? Why fight me? Knowing...that you'll die? - I stand by what I say.
- I stand by what I say. Because that's...my Ninja Way... It was just like this... My parents were killed
before my very eyes by ninja from the Hidden Leaf. Out of love, sacrifice is born... Hate is born... and we are able to know pain. Yes... Know pain. What's that?! Do you hate me? What the hell was
that explosion?!

 You must all evacuate
as far away as you can!

 That is Naruto's Nine-Tails power!

 What?!

 But a Sealing Jutsu should
have been placed on Naruto!
 
 Hinata...

 She was taken down right
in front of Naruto.

 And that triggered it...

 Where's Yamato when
we need him?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

Naruto, do you remember? I'll never forget it. That day...that changed me. Thank you, Naruto. I'm going to do my best. I'll never give up. You will always be...my role model. Naru... Man, I'm hungry... I guess I'll go to Ichiraku. I'm sorry... I wasn't able to thank you back then. Tune in again!

 The power of the Nine-Tails... SEAL It's responding to Naruto's rage. Do you hate me? Do you still think people can
truly understand one another? Your actions are justified. But know this... My pain is far greater than yours! Let's go! Is that all you've got? Not bad. This chakra... I've felt it before. What's going on? Lady Hinata went out to
save Naruto. Don't tell me she's... A Sealing Jutsu? He broke the Seal... Here he comes! He's fast! Almighty Push! Impossible... He withstood my Almighty Push! Naruto. Universal Pull! What was that?! Oh my god... What is that? How is Naruto doing? How can I put it? Naruto is showing
six tails right now. At this rate, he may end up
transforming into the Nine-Tails. Six tails?! Six... It's much worse
than last time! Lady Katsuyu. Please tell everyone
to evacuate immediately. Now what? The Leaf Village is destroyed
beyond recognition. You must all evacuate
as far away as you can! This is due to Naruto's
Nine-Tails power! I know because my clone is
attached to Naruto. He transformed into the Nine-Tails? But Yamato and Kakashi should have
placed a Sealing Jutsu on him! How did this happen? It was Hinata. She tried to save Naruto and
was taken down right in front of him. And then Naruto... So that triggered his transformation? Yes...probably. Where is Yamato? What is he doing at a time like this? Did you find Kabuto? Yes. Good. Don't let him spot you. Wh-What?! What is it? SIX

It can't be... He undid
the Sealing Jutsu on his own! Six Tails?! That's insane! There's an emergency. Sorry, but I must return to the village! H-Hey! The power of the Nine-Tails... How magnificent. Both Naruto and Pain are
moving away from the village. What? It seems Pain is fleeing
from the Nine-Tails Naruto. Serves him right! This is no time for laughs. We have to make sure Hinata is okay, and then do something
about Naruto. The way he is now,
he'll attack anyone in sight. I have to get a hold
of Captain Yamato. I've brought Tendo close enough. Planetary Devastation... You don't have to go that far. Your body can't take any more. Silence, Konan. I must focus. Planetary Devastation! Why did you push yourself
to make it that huge? My opponent is the Nine-Tails. I cannot ease up. The Sage of the Six Paths is
said to have created the moon. This is nothing compared to that. Regardless... I have now captured the Nine-Tails. Why? Why did it come to this? How would you confront this hatred,
in order to create peace? I want to hear your answer. How should I know? It hurts... I hate this. I don't know... What am I supposed to do? I don't know anything anymore! Someone, help me... Give me the answer. Destroy everything. Erase everything that hurts. Give me your soul. I will save you from your suffering. Yes... You're doing fine. EIGHT Eight?! This is bad. This is really, really bad! I never imagined it would
be this powerful. Come over here. Come... Rip this Seal off me. Dammit... It's too late. NINE

 NINE

How could this happen? FOURTH HOKAGE You're... Fourth...Hokage... Naruto... When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de Why did you seal the Nine-Tails
inside of me?!

 I had to go through so much
because of it!

 I trained really hard,
met a lot of people,

 and it made me really happy!

 But then the Akatsuki came after me,
and my friends!

 Dammit, I don't know
what I'm saying anymore!

 It must have been hard for you...

 I'm sorry, Naruto.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Fourth Hokage"

 How old are you now, Naruto?

 Tune in again!

 I worked it into the seal spell so that I would appear within
your psyche, should the seal be broken to the point
you sprouted the eighth tail. I really wanted to avoid that... Since I had no desire to see
you again...Nine-Tails. Then again... I did look forward to seeing
my son as a young man. So I'll call it even. Fourth Hokage! Come here!
I'll rip you to shreds! Well, if that's the case,
I'll stay away. Right, Naruto? Naruto... My name... How come the Fourth Hokage
knows my name? Hm? Well...I'm the one who named you. You are my son, after all. Son? Then...I'm... Yes. You heard me.
You're my son. Fourth Hokage! Loud fellow, isn't he? Let's go somewhere quiet. Third Hokage didn't tell you much
of anything, did he? I guess he wanted to suppress as much
information about Nine-Tails as possible. If people had found out
you were my son, you'd have been in danger. Dad... Why did you seal the Nine-Tails
inside your own son?! Do you know what I went
through because of that?! All the grown-ups looked
at me with contempt... And I couldn't make any friends. I wanted people to accept me, so I trained really hard
to become strong. Then I met Iruka Sensei, and Kakashi Sensei,
and Pervy Sage... And I was happy because
they helped make me stronger! But because of that, a group called
the Akatsuki came after me, so I had to train even more. I got to be even stronger,
but the Akatsuki still killed my friends. But...huh?
What am I saying? Damn it, am I supposed
to be happy or mad?! I don't know anymore! Naruto... How old are you now? Sixteen. Wow... You're already
sixteen years old, huh? It must have been hard for you... I'm sorry, Naruto. I suppose after putting
my own son through so much... I have no right to act like
a father and apologize. It's all right...already. I'm the son...of the Fourth Hokage...
so I can handle it. I sealed half of the Nine-Tails' chakra
inside of you, because I believed
you could control its power. Because you are my son. And there is a reason why I did this. When the Nine-Tails attacked
the village sixteen years ago, I learned something. What? There was a mastermind
who manipulated the Nine-Tails to attack the village. Mastermind? A powerful ninja at that. It would require a special kind of power
to go up against such an opponent. I believe he will attack our village again. The Leaf Village
has already been destroyed. Yes... I watched from inside you. You watched?! I know about Jiraiya Sensei too. Then was it Pain who used the Nine-Tails
to attack the village before? No... It wasn't him. Then who was it?! One of the Akatsuki. The one with the mask. Back then...
he read through every action I took. He's no ordinary ninja. This man is probably just using Pain. No! Pain had a grudge
against the Hidden Leaf! He said, long ago, his own village
was wiped out like ours! That's right. Because of that hatred,
he's being used. Used?! Someone strong like him?! And what about
this mastermind masked ninja? Why is everyone attacking the Leaf? Perhaps as long as there is
a ninja system in this world, there can be no peace. Pain questioned you about peace... But finding the answer is difficult. How would you confront this hatred,
in order to create peace? In order to save something dear...
wars are waged. As long as there is love,
there will be hate. And some will take advantage
of that hatred. This monster known as hate will
not die while there is a system of ninja. It will give birth to more Pains. It was Pain who killed Jiraiya Sensei, but upon careful thought,
it can be said that the chaotic world of the ninja,
which gave rise to Pain, is equally guilty. To be a ninja is to confront hatred. Each and every one of us battles hatred. Jiraiya Sensei trusted you to find
a way to end this hatred. Still, I can't forgive Pain! There's no way I can forgive him. I know... Fourth Hokage... Tell me! What should I do?! FOURTH HOKAGE

You must find the answer yourself. I do not have the answer. If Pervy Sage and you don't know
the answer, how am I to know?! Everyone expects too much! I'm not smart! And I'm not a great ninja! And... I know you'll find the answer. I have faith in you. Really? You really believe I can do it? To be a parent is to have
undying faith in one's child. Now then... It's time for me to go. My chakra's fading. Huh?! No, wait... I will rebuild the seal. However, this will be for the last time. The Leaf can be rebuilt. I'm counting on you...Naruto! Thanks...Dad! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Fourth Hokage He is crawling out of
the Planetary Devastation. What incredible strength. I must increase the size... The Nine-Tails...disappeared?! His doubt is gone... What happened? Does he now have control
over the Nine-Tails? Nagato! The transformation into the Nine-Tails
disturbed my chakra. It made me lose my Shadow Clone. I can only use the Sage Jutsu Chakra
I have left inside of me. He's already in Sage Mode. He's tough. I had to confirm the extent
of the Nine-Tails' power, but I never imagined he could stop
my Planetary Devastation. I thought I was going to die! What the...? That's where the village is... What happened? You did it, Naruto, when you
were in the Nine-Tails state. I killed Hinata, and the people
of the Leaf Village?! She's alive... I can sense Hinata's chakra. I was worried, but no casualties resulted from
your assault in the Nine-Tails state. We were lucky. I see. Thank goodness. What a relief. Naruto... Lady Hinata! Her injuries aren't fatal,
but she needs treatment immediately! I'll find some Medical Ninja right away. The Leaf Village is under attack
by the Akatsuki! I cannot move anymore!
Hurry and go! I didn't know things were this bad. There's an injured toad here too. It's time to settle this. Have you come to understand
a little of what pain is? Unless you know the same pain,
you cannot truly know another. And even if you get to know others,
there can be no understanding. That is the truth. Just like how it's useless
to chase after Sasuke. Take me to where the real Pain is! I want to speak to you face-to-face. Take me to where the real Pain is! I want to speak to you face-to-face. Hmm... So you figured that out? Jiraiya Sensei and now you... You Leaf Ninja are quite impressive. However, our discussion is over. Talking with you will change nothing. Let me talk to him! Sage Mode... It seems you can only throw two
of those nasty chakra shuriken. Isn't that so? After that,
you will run out of Sage Mode! I guess I have no choice
but to fight you! If both of your shuriken miss,
you shall lose. I will give you no more chances. All that's left is to dodge your attack, and
then bring your half-dead body with me. Too bad then... I'll just look for the real Pain myself! But how? I have an idea. He reverse-tracked me using Sage Mode! Found you! Bastard! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Now! Smoke Bombs! Right! Here comes the first shuriken. Almighty Push! What?! He had already launched
the second one using Shadow Shuriken Jutsu?! His jutsu interval is five seconds! I can do this! Four seconds to go! He was already standing by
with a Shadow Clone back then. Three more seconds
until I can use my next jutsu. But he missed both shots... It's over. What?! We still have two more seconds! Go! He had this many Shadow Clones
transformed into rubble?! One more second! Zero! He's now using Shadow Clones
as back up! Someone like you who has no answer... should just give up! But I have faith that there will come a time when
people can truly understand one another. And if I can't find the answer,
perhaps I will entrust you to find it. I know you'll find the answer. I have faith in you. Only you can surpass
the Fourth Hokage. I truly believe that. He withstood it... Impossible! That jutsu cannot be thrown. I have five seconds. This distance will work for me. Give up... ...on me giving up! Rasengan! When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

 That must mean you defeated
the sixth Pain.

 It doesn't matter who won or lost.

 What happened?

 In any case, I'm on my way
to see the real Pain.

 Please don't follow.

 I want to go alone.

 Alone?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Two Students"

 There's something I want
to confirm with him.

 GUY'S ROOM Yamato's Room has been
renamed Guy's Room! Hello, this is your idol...
Might Guy! Our guest today is the pride of
the Leaf Village, kunoichi Hinata Hyuga! H-Hello. Aw come on.
Don't be so bashful on my program. O-Oh umm... She is extremely introverted and shy. Her hobby is pressed flower art. She loves cinnamon rolls and
sweet bean jam? Forget the script! I'll just ask you things
I'm curious about. That's what a live,
youthful interview is about! Huh?! By the way, Hinata... You've really matured lately.
Let me guess, you're in love, right? - W-Well...
- All right, then! Look straight into that camera
and say what's in your heart! I-I can't... If you're too shy, I'll help you! I-I... Let's do it... Okay, love confession in... three, two, one, go! I-I can't! Tune in again!

 Why did she do such a thing? Hinata... You love Naruto? Naruto was able to suppress
the Nine-Tails on his own. On his own? He is about to confront
the last Pain. Lee. We are going to assist Naruto! Right! Please don't. You will only be in his way. But look what they did
to this village. He can't manage alone! Naruto seems to have a plan. Let us have faith in him. Someone like you who
has no answer... should just give up! He withstood it... Impossible! That jutsu cannot be thrown. I have five seconds. This distance will work for me. Give up... ...on me giving up! Rasengan! Nagato... The last Pain has been crushed. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... The Two Students

 Pain operated by receiving
chakra through these sticks. Once it's taken out, he shouldn't be able to move anymore. You and I seek the same thing. We are trying to establish the peace
that Jiraiya Sensei so desired. You and I are not different at all. We each act according to
our own sense of justice. You have your own justice...
and I have mine. Have you come to understand
a little of what pain is? Unless you know the same pain,
you cannot truly know another. And even if you get to know others, there can be no understanding. A cycle of hatred begins. That is history as we know it. So we cannot help but believe that human beings are incapable
of understanding each other. The world of the ninja
is ruled by hatred. You're going? Yeah. Then this time,
use reinforcements. No. I'm going alone! Lady Hinata! Everyone... Thank goodness!
We were so worried. Are you okay, Lady Hinata? Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Sakura. I'm so relieved.
You overdid yourself this time. Everyone, Naruto defeated
the sixth Pain. Way to go Naruto! How is Naruto? Is he hurt? He's exhausted, but otherwise okay. Thank goodness...
Naruto, I'm so glad. So, where is Naruto? He's going alone to
where the real Pain is. Why would he do
something like that?! Guy Sensei! We must follow! Yes! However... Naruto does not
want assistance. Wh-What?! No! Naruto's done enough on his own! He's considerably weakened. Please lead us to Naruto! What is it? It's Naruto... Naruto! Guys... The fact that you're here... Does it mean that
you've defeated the sixth Pain? It doesn't matter who won or lost. What happened? I can't really put it into words. What do you mean...
you can't put it into words? Look, I'm going to see the real Pain. Please don't follow.
I want to go alone. Naruto, you know where
the real Pain is?! Yeah... I found Pain's body
through Sage Mode and when I pulled out the black rod,
I felt his chakra. I see. But you want to go alone? What's going on? I want to confirm something. Confirm? What is it? I want to talk to the real Pain. What?! You're talking nonsense! We're all grateful that
you've defeated Pain. But it's far too late to
settle things with words! Then tell me! If we destroy the real Pain,
and his minions, and the village and everything else
connected to the enemy, will that "settle" things?! What good will talking do? He is our enemy who
destroyed the Leaf Village! We cannot forgive him! I know! I know!
I feel the same way! How can I forgive
a guy like that who did this to our village
and its people?! - Then...
- Inoichi... Let's do as Naruto says
and let him go alone. Shikaku... It is Naruto who stopped Pain. He has every right to speak to Pain. Besides, I'm sure he has his reasons. But... Just let him go. Thanks, Mister Shikaku. Why did you let Naruto
go by himself, Shikaku? It's my son... Your son? Where were you? Black Ops sent a message for you. Well... I went to lecture Naruto... to stop him from acting glum. It was a pain,
but I couldn't help myself. He's got something
that we don't have. "Something"? Yeah... Someday, he's going to become
a very important ninja to this village. When I'm with Naruto... he makes me want to follow him. Shikamaru, who rarely praises people,
said that to me. There really must be something
special about Naruto. I want to believe so. Let's put our faith in Naruto. Konan, get back. But Nagato... It's all right. Are you the real Pain? So peace has stumbled onto me. Do you hate me? You're facing the object
of your vendetta... Do you wish to exact revenge? A cycle of hatred begins. I formed the Akatsuki in order
to stop this cycle of hatred. Nothing in this world will change even if you kill Pain now
and inflict your revenge. All it will be is self-satisfaction. This monster known
as hate will not die while there is a system of ninja. It will give birth to more Pains. To be a ninja is to confront hatred. Each and every one of us
battles hatred. Jiraiya Sensei trusted you to
find a way to end this hatred. If you could not find the answer, then there is nothing you can do, but to do the just thing
and sacrifice yourself for the peace which I am
about to create. At this close distance, I can easily control your movements
with my chakra. Rest assured.
I've avoided hitting your vital spots. For you are invaluable, Jinchuriki. What's wrong, Nagato? He...purposely didn't move. I came here...
intending to talk to you. But, I also wanted to
confirm something. Confirm...something? I wanted to confirm my feelings. If I stood before my enemy... what would I do? I wasn't sure of myself. And? I can't forgive you! Even now, I want to kill you so badly... I can't stop shaking! What? He can resist Nagato's chakra
up close like this?! Even I can see there's too much hate
in our Ninja World. And I've wanted to do
something about this hatred, yet I'm not sure what must be done. I'm glad I made you my student. Pervy Sage said he believed
that the day would come when people can truly understand
one another. I wasn't paying much attention
when he told me that... Even when he said he'd entrust me
with finding the answer. I got excited, taking it as a sign that he acknowledged me
as his student. Thinking back... I finally understand what
Pervy Sage meant. That it's not so simple. Still, it doesn't change the fact
that you can't forgive me. Words of forgiveness come easy. Love does not. Yeah... You're right about that. Jiraiya Sensei's words reflect
an idealism from an era long past. It is far removed from reality. Didn't you say you would kill me and bring peace to the Ninja World? Even if you seek vengeance
for your own satisfaction, if that is your idea of justice,
so be it. You're not a god. After witnessing this harsh reality, do you really still believe
Jiraiya Sensei's silly ramblings? When I found out you were
Pervy Sage's student, I wanted to ask you one thing. What is it? How could the Pervy Sage's students
turn out the way you did? I understand that you're not
like the Akatsuki members who kill out of sheer enjoyment. But I don't know a thing
about you guys. That's why... I want to hear your stories,
then come up with an answer. Very well... We will tell you about our pain. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de Did you hear, Sakura?

 Master, I heard you used to

and such. Wow... I'm interested to know what you
looked like in your youth, Lady Tsunade. Oh, me too! Hmm... Very well then! Well? Pretty charming,
don't you think? Huh? Wh-What's with you two?! I-Is there something
you want to say? Wh-Wh-What? - That...
- Turns into that?! Lady Tsunade! What was your diet
like during adolescence? And any other secrets you have! - Tell us already!
- Tell us already! Cut it out! Tune in again!

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,770
<i>Sasori...</i> All right, break's over. Guy Sensei, are you sure? Yeah. I'm totally fine.
I woke up completely refreshed. Neji. No problem. He has appalling
recuperative power. Uh-huh... So that leaves... I'm ready to go, too. All right, now to make up
for the time we lost resting, we're going to double the pace. What?! No, let's make it triple. If we do that, we'll arrive
earlier than first planned. I see. All right guys, let's make it quadruple
the pace while we're at it. What's the matter? That's impossible,
no matter how you consider things. I told you guys to stop
getting so carried away! Guy Sensei, that's why
I said triple the pace. Lee, that's a little off, too. Now then... That should be enough rest... Break time is over.
We should get going. Wake up, you two.
We're leaving. O-Okay. A little longer...
Let me sleep a little longer. You're going to save Gaara, aren't you? Of course I am! <i>The Death of Gaara!


</i> <i>The enemy hideout
should be in this direction...</i> I'm sorry... Gaara... <i>We'll now be entering
the final stage.</i> <i>What shall we do about the pesky flies?</i> <i>They're moving
at a greater speed than anticipated.</i> <i>No problem.</i> <i>We stalled them effectively.
Just ignore them.</i> <i>Besides, we've got some insurance.</i> In the end, we'll be the ones
who have to take care of them. Let's hurry and finish
things up here, Deidara. We've got guests to greet. You'll want to catch
a breath before that, don't you? That's right. We have welcoming preparations
to take care of. <i>Man, they're sure a pain.</i> <i>And we're having a hard time
finding our Jinchuriki...</i> <i>Don't get so irritated.</i> <i>We just need to take care
of our own missions.</i> <i>That's enough idle chatter.</i> <i>Concentrate! Mistakes will
not be tolerated from here on.</i> Each team will be deployed
as I just announced. The absence of Lord Kazekage
is a highly classified matter! However, operate under
the assumption that the information has
already been leaked. It's conceivable that the nearby lands will take advantage of this confusion
and execute an attack. Don't think of this as
just an ordinary border patrol. The teams that are ready
will depart at once. What's the matter, Matsuri? Is this really okay? Is what okay? Lord Gaara has been kidnapped. And yet, here we are guarding
a border for an enemy who may or may not come
instead of trying to save him. It's an order from our superiors.
We can only obey. No way! Lord Gaara is the Hidden Sand's... our Kazekage! I know that!
Gaara's my little brother, you know! I'm sorry... This way. Right! I don't like it. What is it, Neji? Is it an enemy? No, just the opposite. I don't feel any enemy presence at all.
That's what's bothering me. Here they went so far as to use... that powerful of a Jutsu
in an attempt to stall us. Then... Could it be...? They no longer need to stall us. I'm saying there's
a good chance of that. Don't tell me... <i>H-He's...</i> Hang on, Gaara. Naruto, wait up! Geez. Why's that kid trying so hard to
save Gaara who's from a different village? And what in the world is he? He's also a Jinchuriki. He has the Nine-Tail sealed within him. Indeed, Naruto probably
doesn't have much attachment to the Hidden Sand itself. But Gaara is a Jinchuriki Host
just like he is. More than anyone
in the Hidden Sand, Naruto knows how Gaara feels. After all, the Jinchuriki has been
treated the same way in every village. That's exactly why he feels
like he has to save Gaara. It doesn't make
any difference to him if he's from the Leaf or the Sand. For Naruto, Gaara is a friend who knows the same pain as he does. Naruto's dream is to
become the Hokage. He was frustrated when he heard
that Gaara had become the Kazekage. <i>I see. So Gaara became
the Kazekage, huh?</i> But at the same time, he was also very happy for
Gaara from the bottom of his heart. <i>I won't be outdone by him!</i> <i>I'll become the Hokage,
no matter what.</i> <i>Just you wait, Gaara!</i> Naruto has a mysterious power. However small the words he exchanges,
he makes friends immediately... with everyone he meets. I myself have lived a long life. I've seen many things. And in my own way, I've learned the nature
of things in this world. Learning that the alliance with
other lands were for show only, what I did was to create resources
to protect the Hidden Sand. I'm the one who used the Jutsu... and forced the possession
of the Shukaku on Gaara. After consulting with his father
the Fourth Kazekage, that is. What I did to protect the village
ended up just hurting it. And now a village I avoided
because I couldn't believe in alliances is trying to help us. Everything I've done might
have been mistaken. And now I've gotten old
and learn to give up easily. Kakashi... Young people have
so much potential within... I'm so envious. Oh no, you're just getting started... You're still very much young. That's right... There might still be something
an old bag like me can do. <i>Something I can do.</i> <i>It's about finished.</i> <i>Whose...hand is this?</i> <i>Oh...it's my hand.</i> <i>Have I...become an existence
someone needs?</i> <i>Huh? What?</i> <i>Is that me?</i> <i>That's me... The me who wanted
to be needed by...someone...</i> <i>Why...? Why did I want
to be like that?</i> <i>Why...am I...
an existence that desires that?</i> <i>Those eyes. That nose.
That mouth.</i> <i>Why?</i> <i>Why is that Gaara?</i> <i>I was inside that...</i> <i>No...</i> <i>What am I in the first place?</i> <i>I'm just aware that I'm me.</i> <i>What am I...in the first place?</i> <i>I'm just a small...feeling.</i> <i>It's finished.</i> Oh man. In the end, it took three days
and three nights. <i>It's exhausting every time, isn't it?</i> <i>Ohhh, my shoulders are all stiff.</i> <i>Good work, everyone.</i> <i>I've got a bad feeling
 about this.</i> Damn it! Isn't there something I can do? This is the place, huh? Gaara is on the other side
of this boulder. It looks like they put up a barrier. What's the plan? Let's bust through! No! You're late... Kakashi. Well, you see... We got caught up in
something troublesome along the way. Naruto! Sakura! Kakashi... By troublesome, you certainly
don't mean me, do you? Hey! Naruto... We were just a step behind
you guys, huh? Who's the old woman there? Oh, this is Lady Chiyo,
a consultant to the Sand. Nice to meet you. Now, shall we do this, Kakashi? Yeah. <i>Hang on, Gaara.</i> Allow me to explain! The title of the next episode is,
"Button Hook Entry." This refers to a method Ninja
used to break through entrances by fanning out left and right
with the entrance in between. By the way, it seems
a lot of people tend to confuse my "Dynamic Entry" as
a name for a Jutsu, but it's a credited way
to break into places. It's an excellent tactic
where speed is of the essence, and also serves as
an effective diversion! How about that?! Now you're more knowledgeable
about our mission! Next episode:
"Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry!!" What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Naruto Shippuden Special -
Big Adventure!
The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy -
Part 1 Summoning Jutsu! All right! Nope! Why not?! How many times must I explain?! This is a tadpole! Not a toad! Look closely! It has legs! No means no! Do it again! Damn it! Isn't there
an easier way to do this? You fool! There is no shortcut
in the Ninja Way! You say that, but I've been working
my chakra this whole time. Do you know how tiring that is...?! Oh... He still has a long way to go. I thought the Fourth Hokage's Legacy would get you through
the Final Round. Fourth Hokage's Legacy? The Final Round of
the Chunin Exam is to be held here in the Hidden Leaf
Village tomorrow. The air is overflowing with excitement
due to the participants' high hopes and the curiosity of the Feudal Lords
and ninja who have come from near and far
to watch the competition. Sasuke, one more time... The success of this mission
depends on your performance, Gaara. Yeah. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL It's no surprise that the Uchiha kid
and Shikaku's son are still in it. But who would have imagined
that Naruto would still be in the running? I know... There are quite a few in
the crowd that I don't recognize. Well, officials from each of
the Feudal Lord's clans have come to the village as well. Hmm... Hey, which will it be? Why don't we pick the long shot
and go for this Naruto Uzumaki? You don't usually see odds as bad
as his in the Final Round. According to rumors,
he got in by sheer accident. His first-round opponent
is Neji Hyuga. Hyuga of the Byakugan? There's no chance of
an accident here. Which means, our safe choice
is the survivor of the Uchiha. Sasuke Uchiha, eh? His opponent from the Sand
is quite creepy too. Cripes! Old man, seconds please! Me too! Sure thing! Here ya go! - Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food! Are you sure you're okay? You better take it easy, or you'll end up back
in the hospital again. Naruto made it to
the Final Round. But I... Pa's nice, so he never
says anything. But I'm sure inside,
he's gotta be disappointed. So at least in eating,
I can't ever lose! Another bowl! Coming right up! I'll do my best for you too! Thanks for the food, old man! Naruto... Here ya go! All right, that means I win?! Naruto, who's gonna pay
for the ramen?! Here's the bill! Oh... I can't waste any time! My physical strength has returned. So I'm gonna start training again
to prep for the Final Round... Huh? Brother Naruto,
I challenge you to a fight! Sorry, Konohamaru.
The Final Round is coming up, and I don't have time to
be playing with you. I developed a new jutsu! What?! A new jutsu? Hmm... Okay, let me see. Here I go! Oh! A stick jutsu?! Sexy Jutsu! Hot Body Pole Dance! Oh! Well? Too hot for you? What?! But I perfected
my new Sexy Jutsu! Konohamaru! The path to mastering
the Sexy Jutsu is deep and dangerous. I figured out that variation
a long time ago. Darn it! And I was so confident about it too... Well then! I guess I'll have to
show you the new Sexy Jutsu that I developed! Okay, Brother Naruto! That guy... Sorry, Konohamaru... I'm really busy getting ready
for the Final Round. Brother... Are you in a rush? Didn't Jiraiya Sensei teach you
a new jutsu? Pervy Sage?! I thought the Fourth Hokage's Legacy would get you through
the Final Round. That's it! Thanks, Konohamaru! What's happened to him? If I have the "Fourth Hokage's Legacy"  that Pervy Sage was talking
about back then, getting through the Final Round
should be a cinch! And that's why you've come
to see me? I figured surely you would know. Fourth Hokage's Legacy... If there is such a thing,
I'd certainly like to see it. Aw c'mon! You must know.
Tell me the truth. If you tell me, I'll show you
the new Sexy Jutsu I developed. If you have time to show me
such a thing, focus instead on the Final Round! You stingy old geezer! Hmm... I have to find someone
who might know. But Kakashi Sensei's training
with Sasuke, and I don't know where they went. Oh well, I'll just check out
every place I can think of. What? Is this some new mystery? No, it's not. Then it must be
a code-breaking game! You played those a lot as a kid! And Shikamaru's probably
the one who posed the problem. If so, it's useless asking me.
You probably hold the key. Never mind. I'll ask someone else. Mmm... Look at the sensual shine on this glaze... I can't resist it. The dumplings here are too sweet. By the way, Anko Sensei, do you know what
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy is? You just took a stick of dumplings
from my plate. Do you want to die before
the Final Round? No, I just want to know what
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy is... Give back my dumplings! Hold it! I just want to know
about the Fourth Hokage's Legacy! Like I would know! I'd better hightail it outta here! My dumplings! All that for just a stick of dumplings! I was about to be skewered! But it's strange that no one knows. Why if it isn't Naruto!
Is something the matter? Bushy Brow Sensei?! What're you doing here? I'm on a pilgrimage to 100 shrines
to pray for Lee's recovery! I see... What's the matter?
Is something bothering you? Well... Maybe you would know,
Bushy Brow Sensei. Naturally! Ask me anything. Well, I'm looking for
Fourth Hokage's Legacy. Wh-What?! Fourth Hokage's Legacy?! My belly's full,
but my wallet's empty. Huh?! Bushy Brow Sensei,
do you know something? But of course! It's the ultimate secret left behind by the Fourth Hokage,
right, Naruto? And what is it? What is it?
Please tell me! Hmm... I really wish I could... But it's a village matter that
is classified as top secret. Aw... Don't say that. Please! I really understand your desire
to learn the secret. But unfortunately, as a jonin, I cannot divulge the secrets
of the village so easily. Oh! Huh?! Oh! What a coincidence! What are the odds of finding
a pamphlet detailing classified information
about the Fourth Hokage's Legacy on the ground?! THE FOURTH HOKAGE'S LEGACY


A pamphlet on
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy?! Fourth Hokage's Legacy? I-I can't read it... Oh... That's read "Honegami Grounds." Fourth Hokage's Legacy
is hidden there. But a menacing goblin is
also said to live there. A goblin... Furthermore, only a handful,
including the Fourth Hokage, have ever returned alive. Don't think about going to
a place like that, even by mistake! G-Guy Sensei, your face is scary. Even if a super-ultimate secret
lies in wait there, it is too dangerous. So forget it. Are you kidding?! I want to find it and
win the Final Round! Now that's what adolescence is for! Do your best! And do it for Lee who is in the hospital! Lucky thing I heard that.
I've gotta let Shikamaru know. All right! Honey Honey Grounds,
here I come! Naruto! S-Sakura! Return to the hospital! You need to rest!
Tomorrow is the Final Round! Sakura, please just look
the other way! I have a really good reason for this! Huh? Shikamaru, you have some kind of plan
for the Final Round, right? I guess... You guess?!
How can you be so nonchalant? We have to battle one extra person. And I don't feel up to
avenging Choji. Hey! I just heard something really big. Huh?! Huh? Why are you coming along, Sakura? Let me see that... There might be a fierce monster. There's no way I'd let you go
to a place like that alone. You've barely recovered! I'm on Team 7 too. Sakura... If I can give this Fourth Hokage's Legacy
to Sasuke as a gift, he'll like me even more! Cha! It's a fairy tale come true! I wonder how much longer it is
to Gummy Gummy Grounds? We should see it a little bit farther up. Those guys... Where are they going with
the Final Round around the corner? Is it that important of a mission? There were fifteen of
us Hidden Rain ninja... Not a single one of us made it
through Round Two. We can't return to the village
in such disgrace. Hmm... We'll follow them! We must at least find something good
we can take back home. This is Honey Honey Grounds? This place feels awfully dangerous... Not to worry.
I'm gonna be the future Hokage. Leave it to me! That's why I'm worried. All right! Let's go! Oh! Naruto! I knew something like
this would happen. I can't stand to watch this. Huh?! Ino? Huh? How'd you guys get in?! Over there. Huh?! What are you doing here? As if we'd let Team 7 monopolize
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy! Oh? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb.
We know all about it. Damn her sharp ears. Huh?! Anyway, Shikamaru or Naruto? Who will win the Final Round?! You could also call this
our Round Two. Get ready, Billboard Brow! Fine with me. I'll crush you this time, Ino Pig. Let me say just one thing. You'll be the one in tears at the end! Well, wash your neck 'cuz
your head's gonna roll! Billboard Brow! Ino Pig! If we're talking secret techniques to
assure victory in the Chunin Exam, Shikamaru has every right
to them too. All right then! We ain't gonna lose to Team 10!
Let's go, Sakura! Welcome, my young challengers! Huh?! - Guy Sensei!
- Guy Sensei! Yes... I am the sage who oversees
Honegami Grounds. Wow! An old sage?! Who would fall for that?! His wig is lopsided. Guy Sensei... Honegami Grounds is a sealed,
forbidden practice site. If you can get through it faster than
the Fourth Hokage's record time, you will obtain the ultimate secret. What? We have to beat
the Fourth Hokage's record time? That's asking too much. Say, Old Sage! Isn't there an easy way to do this?! Hm... This is more difficult than
an S-rank mission. You must be willing to risk
your life for this, or it will be impossible. Damn it! What is that doing there?! That's the Tiger Scroll, which contains hints to get through
this practice site! And it's mine! Shadow Possession Jutsu! Naruto! Whoa! You wouldn't understand it
even if you looked at it. Shikamaru! See ya! Owwww... Cripes... Hurry, Naruto!
We're going after them! All right...oops! Shape up! Right! Now go, young challengers! The first hurdle should come
into sight soon. This is the first hurdle? Jeez, they sure underestimated us. Why you... Don't go on ahead! Let's hurry! GIANT TIGHTROPE

Giant...tightrope? Wait, everyone! Like I'd wait! I won't let you get away, Ino! Team 7 without Sasuke
is no competition! Huh? What?! - I don't like this.
- I can't walk! Shikamaru! What's going on with this?! GIANT SPIDER TIGHTROPE

Giant spider tightrope? Yikes, it's coming this way! Yeah, but I can't move! Hey, what're we gonna do?! Like I'd let a spider like that get me! Yikes! It's coming this way! Naruto! Put your kunai away! Huh?! I can't do that! I said put it away! If you don't want to end up as food! Damn it. It's as though he lost sight of us. What's going on? The Tiger Scroll says,
"Close the blade, calm the heart." And what does that mean? The tremors on the web
alert the spider that prey has been caught. By remaining still,
we fooled the spider into thinking that it was just a fallen leaf. But my legs are tangled in the web,
and I can't move. We can't escape like this. Just listen... There are two distinct kinds
of spider silk. The weft thread is sticky and
used for capturing prey, and the non-sticky warp thread
is used for crossing. So if we move along the warp thread,
we won't get stuck! Which means...this one is okay. You're right! I'll try it too. I can move! Thank you, Shikamaru. All right! Whoa, this isn't good. Okay! Warp thread, warp thread... You idiot! What are you doing?! We've gotta take care of
this thing in case it attacks before we've completely
crossed the web. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Na-ru-to... Uzumaki Barrage! A summoning?! So someone summoned
that giant spider? - We did it!
- We did it! Do something! What is he doing? Shikamaru... Hey, watch out for the weft thread! Phew... You saved me. It looks like this Tiger Scroll
has hints on how to get through
the hurdles of the test grounds. What's it say? "Close the blade, calm the heart." "Offer a wild chrysanthemum." "Be extremely nimble,
show determination." "Go beyond hatred." "For the one who approaches,
the path will not open." "The location of infinity,
to the one anointed." Huh? What do they mean? Is it like a poem? The first two lines were hints
on crossing the web. But the rest... That giant spider was summoned. Meaning, it was an intentional trap. Then there are more traps
from here on too? Probably... Aw man, what a pain! You should talk! Jeez! It's useless to stay here
and think about it! Naruto! There he goes again! We just have to go and find out.
We just have to go! When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto Because I always remember you, in situations like this... I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de Jeez! I almost died because
Naruto is so reckless!

 Yeah. Makes you worry about
what's to come!

 The next hurdle should be right up here.
You guys go first. 

 Why? What are you gonna do,
Shikamaru?

 I have something I have to do. 

 Just go ahead of me.
You're in a hurry, right?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Big Adventure!
The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy -
Part 2!"
 What's Shikamaru up to?

 Tune in again!

 What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Big Adventure!
The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy -
Part 2! It's starting to take shape. No, not yet. Considering I'm only aiming
at a motionless rock. That's true... I wish you could test it to see whether it will work in a real battle
in the Final Round. What is this? Man, that giant spider was
a surprise! So why did you dash out
to confront it? That was so dangerous! All right, let's beat
the Fourth Hokage's record time and find this legacy! Did you hear what I said?! Ow! Sakura, that hurts...
Ow, my nose! Shikamaru? The next hurdle should
be right up here. You guys go first. What are you gonna do? I have something I have to do. Just go ahead of me.
You're in a hurry, right? What's with him? Yo! Where are you going? You fool!
Why are you following me?! Well, I wanted to know
where you're going. Whoa! What is that?! Sheesh... Don't get distracted by a rock! The enemy...is that shadow! Enemy?! Die! Shadow Possession Jutsu
was a success. That was close. So close. Heh! I'll show ya what I can do! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Wait! A Shadow Clone? They're better than I thought... Retreat! You're the Hidden Rain ninja
who didn't make the Chunin Exam. What is your objective? Objective? Don't tell me you guys
are also trying to get the Fourth Hokage's Legacy,
the ultimate secret?! A-Are you stupid?! Huh? Cripes! Don't come after us again. Next time,
you won't get away with it. Huh? Hey! Why'd you let them go?! You just sowed some
troublesome seeds, again. Anyway, we don't have time to
deal with them right now! We have to beat
the Fourth Hokage's record. Shikamaru! What happened? Just a small distraction. So, what's the next hurdle? Well... The tag's come off... We don't have time. Let's just go! Hey, Naruto! Jeez! We still haven't
deciphered the Tiger Scroll! "Offer a wild chrysanthemum..." We're at the next hurdle! What is this? RETIRE BUTTON

It says, "retire button." Come back! Don't go forward recklessly! Huh? Huh? What is this? It's sleeping gas! The entrance! Don't breathe, Naruto! Climb to the ceiling! A-Are we locked in? There should be a way
to stop this smoke. Something... From up here, it looks like a giant flower. "Offer a wild chrysanthemum..." Choji! Use your Human Boulder
and blow this smoke outta here! Then search that hole
under the floor! Gotcha! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! Is there anything in that hole? Hold on! Umm... There's a switch! Okay, press it! Right! Thank goodness. Can you walk, Ino? Yeah... An exit! Hey, it's a river! The path is...this way! Okay, everyone! Just follow me! Hey, start studying a little. What're you doing?! First, the Tiger Scroll. We can't afford any more mistakes. These poem-like phrases contain hints on how to get through
the hurdles. Hmm... Let's figure out countermeasures
before we find ourselves in a bind. Cripes, you're always jumping
the gun and putting everyone in danger, Naruto! Sakura, don't say such a thing... Shikamaru, what's written next? Yeah... "Be extremely nimble,
show determination." Nimble, eh? All right! Naruto! What're you doing?! Nimbly showing determination! Stupid Naruto! We have no choice. Let's go! Weren't you listening earlier?! Well, I'm just following
the Tiger Scroll. Do you feel the current picking up? I-Is it because of that? - We did it!
- We did it! We'll crash onto the rocks! Even if you miss the rocks,
we'll fall under the waterfall. Why are you talking like
an observer? Huh? I'm just making
a calm assessment! Stop it, both of you! You should talk!
Start doing something! What?! Shut up! Damn, what does it mean
by "show determination"? What's that? That rock looks like
a miniature version of the Hidden Leaf Village's
Great Stone Faces. What? Shikamaru! What do we do?! We have to hurry or we'll crash! Show determination, huh? I have determination! Naruto... No matter what, I'm gonna get
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy! Naruto! How many times
do I have to... No! This one time, Naruto is right!
Jump to the right! I see... It was set up like this
beneath the waterfall. A rainbow forms on
the left side with the water spray, but not on the right side. If we had chosen the left side,
we'd have been eliminated. Hey, you're heavy!
Hurry up and move! Huh? What are you saying? Are you calling me heavy?
You're one to talk! Yes, I'm calling you heavy,
Ino Pig! Stop kidding around,
Billboard Brow! This is a fight that has absolutely
nothing to do with me... Nope. You three are all pretty heavy! Huh?! - What?!
- What?! Jeez, Naruto, you don't have
a shred of delicacy. I pity you, Sakura... Being stuck on the same team
with a guy like that. That's for sure! Really! Wh-Why? FINAL HURDLE All right! We're at the final hurdle. Huh?! Ino! You... Choji! You... Sorry, Naruto, but we're going
alone from here on. We're taking
the Fourth Hokage's Legacy. Hey... This is unfair. We want Shikamaru to win,
no matter what. Shikamaru, now's our chance! Shikamaru! "Go beyond hatred." "For the one who approaches,
the path will not open." That's what the poem says next. Maybe it means the path
won't open if you have a falling out
with comrades? Now you're sounding like
a decent guy. You've really become a pain. That's very fitting of you
to say that, Shikamaru. Well, I figured it would
turn out like this. Shikamaru! Huh? Let's both get through this
and meet in the finals! Here, this is yours. I'm returning it to you. You actually think
you'll be in the finals? She's right. Sasuke's the one
who will advance. Huh?! Well, as long as it's someone
from the Hidden Leaf. Y-Yeah, that's right. All right! Let's go! Unfortunately... You guys won't be in
the Final Round. You won't be as lucky this time. Wow... All these scrolls have
secret techniques written inside? I don't know. We have to find the real secret
among these. And the clock's gonna
be ticking while we do this. There's no mistake. Fourth Hokage's Legacy
is here somewhere! Let's open up every one of them! Stop! Look at the size of this
sacred place. Who knows what kind of trap
has been laid. Besides, the scrolls in here
are all probably fakes. Fake? It'll take days to check
this volume of scrolls. We'll never break
the Fourth Hokage's record time. There has to be something...
something. Some way... A way... Just use your head! Stupid Naruto! Sakura... That was mean. Stupid...stupid... Stupid...stupid...
stupid...stupid! Stupid...stupid... Give me a break.
Stop saying that already. That's not me! Huh? Stupid...stupid...stupid Naruto! Why you...! Stupid parrot!
You have no right to call me stupid! Stupid Naruto! Stupid Naruto! Quit saying stupid, stupid! Stupid Naruto! Stupid, stupid! Why you...! Ninja Art: Grudge Rain! One on one,
we can't beat them. But if I gather our grudge and
put a curse on them with a jutsu... Enshroud them
in the cursed cloud... and rain grudge upon them. Stupid Naruto! - Stupid Naruto!
- Come down from there! Stupid. Stupid parrot! Water? Shikamaru! M-My chakra... What's this?
I feel my power draining. This is...not ordinary water. This rain sucks out your chakra. It is a rain of tears from all
the grudges we hold against you. Why are guys like you, who didn't pass the Chunin Exam,
sneaking around here? Although it is irritating to
do as Kakashi says... You're the Hidden Leaf's... He's right about this being
a perfect chance to test my jutsu. Sasuke Uchiha! R-Retreat! Wait, Samidare! He's acting strange... Isn't this our chance? N-No! Let's get him! He's strong, after all. We don't have a chance
against someone who made it through to
the Final Round. We're saved. Was this planned too? I'm starving... - I'll eat this.
- Gimme, gimme! - Hey, thief!
- Thank you! Naruto! Get close to the parrot! Huh? Yummy! Good! I get it. This is my chance to
catch that revolting parrot! No! Huh? Smile a little!
Be friendly as you approach. Wha-? How? L-Like this? Little parrot! Hello! Stupid Naruto? Stupid! Stupid! Smile, Naruto! Wh-Why? His smile is creepy! Be more natural! Yeah, it's easy for you to say. Think happy thoughts. Sakura... Shikamaru must have
something planned. Go for it, Naruto. If you say so, Sakura,
I'll do my best! Smile! Don't forget to smile! Just like that, Naruto! Pretty good! Happy thoughts...
Happy thoughts... I'll become a chunin and go on a lovey-dovey date
with Sakura. Oh yuck! "Go beyond hatred..." "For the one who approaches,
the path will not open." So that meant the gate
wouldn't open as long as Naruto kept
chasing the parrot. Oh! Here it is! Fourth Hokage's Legacy! The final lines of the poem... "The location of infinity,
to the one anointed." Does that mean this scroll
contains everything? Yeah... Although there could
be some unthinkable trap. I believe in that Tiger Scroll! That old sage gave it to us! That's why it's suspect. - Yikes!
- Yikes! Humph... Guy Sensei! Why are you... ...here?! Shikamaru! You too, Choji and Ino,
what're you talking about?! Where is Bushy Brow Sensei?! - Huh?!
- Huh?! You still believe
it's an old sage, Naruto? Say, Old Sage! What about it? Did we break
the Fourth Hokage's record? Did we make it in time? I really, really want
Fourth Hokage's Legacy! I need it in order to get
through the Final Round! Ahem! You shattered the Fourth Hokage's
old record! Yay! And so...I shall present you
with Fourth Hokage's Legacy, the ultimate secret. Yeah, yeah! Read the first characters of
each verse across the page! I wish you luck! Farewell! It was so obvious... Umm... "Close the blade..." "Calm the heart..." Huh? Blade...heart? A blade with a heart
means "ninja." Oh yeah! Then... Let's see... THERE IS NO SHORTCUT TO
WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IN A NINJA

"There is no shortcut to
what is essential in a ninja." - Huh?!
- Huh?! Good work. Sure thing. It was good training for
passing the Final Round. And we were able to
assess their mastery of their jutsu quite nicely. Sasuke, you're taking too long
to release that jutsu. It won't be effective
in the Final Round. I know. We're leaving, Guy.
Sasuke still needs some training. Yup! Leave the rest to me! Cripes, Choji! Does it mean this was all
Guy Sensei's joke on us?! Well... I'm just as disappointed as you. That was so mean laying
such dangerous traps too. Doesn't he have better things
to do with his time?! Don't be so quick to judge him. After passing through
several hurdles, didn't you notice something? At first, we were only thinking
about our team winning. That's true. And now, we just want someone
from our village to win. Yeah... I know! - Huh?
- Huh? There is no shortcut to
what is essential in a ninja! Don't take the shortcut.
Just take the long way! All right! Sakura! Shikamaru! Choji! Ino! We're gonna start all over again! - What?!
- What?! He's a pain, after all. Stupid! Stupid! The Final Round of the Chunin Exam
began the next day. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

have to say...then decide.

 Fine, I will show you our pain.

 Nagato! This is a waste of time!

 Let's deal with him right now.

 Wait, Konan...

 I want to hear his answer.

 He crushed the six Pains
and made it here alone.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Meeting"

 Two moments define
my greatest pain. Tune in again!

 What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Meeting

 You're awake. Great Lord Elder! I thought your life would be
in danger if I left you like that. I'm beholden to you. Can't wait even though you're ailing? This works best for the wound. What of the boy? He is speaking with the real Pain. What?! Speaking with Pain? The two children of prophecy
have come face to face. How will they settle this? I want to hear what you have to say... then decide. Fine. I will show you our pain. Nagato! This is a waste of time! Let's deal with him right now. Wait, Konan... I want to hear his answer. Besides, he won't go down so easily. He crushed the six Pains
and made it here alone. Two moments define my greatest pain. One is the death of my parents. It was when the Hidden Rain Village
became involved in the Great Nations' war and
was turned into a battlefield. Found anything? Yeah, some canned goods. Our first meal in four days! No, three days. Who cares? Let's eat.
I won't last another minute. Let's search the other places later. We might find more stuff. Now's our chance to
make a run for it. What if they see us? I'm scared. Don't worry. Just be very quiet. Man, that's good! Who's there?! Damn! Enemies?! Run now! Nagato, go! Nagato...
Hurry... Get away... Run, Nagato! Run away! Hurry! H-He's just a kid? Oh no... These people are not ninja! What'll we do?! Why did this happen?! How could we mistake them
for the enemy?! Damn it! W-We didn't know there were still
any civilians in the war zone. I'm so sorry, kid. What? What happened? Dad... Mom? My mother and father died in the war that your Hidden Leaf started. I've never forgotten
the pain of that moment. I've endured it to this very day. This pain turned into hatred and made my powers blossom. It wasn't until later that I realized
I was the one who killed the two ninja. Goodbye, Mom...Dad... Food became scarce,
so I left my home. This is the last that's left. I'm too hungry to walk. Thank you... If you didn't wake me up,
I'd probably be dead. Sorry... Even if you follow me,
I can't feed you. I don't have a thing to eat. Excuse me...
Can you spare some food for me? I... I haven't eaten in so long. I'm sorry... I have nothing to give you. Times are tough.
We barely have enough for ourselves. I'm really sorry,
but try somewhere else. But this was my last stop. Let's go... I can't go any further...
Am I going to die here? Here... Eat this. Are you sure? Uh-huh... Here, eat this slowly. Konan, who are those two? Sorry... They were on the verge of dying. You even picked up a dog? Cripes, what's the name? Chibi... You sure have a weird name! No, I meant the dog. It was then that I met Konan,
who stands before you, and a boy named Yahiko. They were also war orphans. But they were strong,
fighting desperately to stay alive. And I joined them. Wow... So much food... If you intend to stay here,
I expect you to help find provisions too. Provisions? How? - We steal.
- Steal? But...isn't that a bad thing? Are you stupid? We live in hard times where
we have to fend for ourselves. Pretty words are not enough
to get us by! Pretty words... We have to do whatever
it takes to live, even stealing. Got it? Got it. Could you please give us some food? Just a little will do...please. I don't have any fish to give out.
Now scram! You stingy man! What?! You rotten brat! Ah! Hey! You stray dog! Stop! My goodness! Huh?! Hey! Where'd they go?! Good job, Chibi! Hey! If you're not gonna buy,
go away! Ow... Shameless kids! Next time, you won't get off so easy! Facilities to help war orphans of
a tiny nation were non-existent. For kids without family,
there was no other choice. Yet even in such a reality,
Yahiko never lost hope. Yahiko never lost hope... Are you guys okay?
Well, these things happen. I guess... Nagato... Do you have a dream? A dream? I don't intend to die in a place like this. I have a huge dream! World domination! World domination? That's right! If I rise to the top of the world, I'll never have to go through
this suffering again! You think so? Besides, if I were to keel over now, I couldn't face Mom and Dad
who brought me into this world. Right, Konan? Uh-huh... If you conquer the world,
you can do whatever you please. That's just like being a god. I wonder if you can stop the fighting too. Are you all right? Uh-huh... Damn... What was that?! Ninja are fighting so close. It's Hanzo and the Hidden Leaf ninja! It was Jiraiya Sensei and
his two comrades. They who would later
become known as the Legendary Sannin
of the Hidden Leaf. Their opponent was Hanzo,
leader of the Hidden Rain. The battle raged on. And... Chibi! Chibi is... What'll I do, Yahiko?!
Chibi's not breathing! Worry about Chibi later!
First, we have to get away from here! Chibi... Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Why?! If the fighting doesn't stop... I'll become the god of this world! That's when...Yahiko's dream
became my dream. Nagato... Stop your crying! If all you do is cry after
you get beaten down, nothing will change! Just like this nation. I'm going to change this nation! And for that you need more
than words, you need power! Power? We're going to learn ninjutsu! Ninjutsu? From who? The Hidden Leaf ninja
who were fighting Hanzo. I just went to the battle site. I didn't see their corpses. They fought with Hanzo,
but they're still alive! They must be amazingly strong! But... I hate Hanzo! He changed Hidden Rain Village
into a war zone like this. Anyway, I'm gonna become
a student of those strong ninja. I'm going after them! What if you go after them and
find out they've been killed? Then I'll look for whoever did them in. I've made up my mind. Take only nonperishable foods. Do we just toss the rest? No. Goodbye, Chibi. What're you doing here? These are for you to share with
the grocer and the fruit stand lady. I figure, in some ways, we owe you. Take care. We're sorry... Huh? But pursuing the Leaf's Sannin
was no simple task. Going after ninja meant
going deep into the battle zone even though we were just kids. Don't ever take off your mask. If there are toxins in the mist,
that'll be the end of us. Are you okay? Stop! A booby trap! Well? Do I look cool? We're gonna become strong! - Right!
- Right! There's no way a ninja would
leave tracks behind. The Leaf's Sannin were
not easy to find. But Yahiko refused to
give up hope. We headed deeper into
the battle zone. We believed that the greater
the intensity of battle, the more likely
we'd find the Sannin. Here! Hang in there, Konan! Okay. It seems like...
the explosions have stopped. This is a bad spot! Yahiko... Yahiko... Where am I? We found them... Huh?! Fate took us straight
to the Leaf's Sannin. We finally found him. We found Jiraiya Sensei. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

 No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure.

 I see.

 What are you always pondering, Sensei?

 I want to do something about this world,
which is filled with hate.

 And to know what the answer
to true peace is...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Origin of Pain"

 And finally,   
we matured... Tune in again!

 I'm not done yet! Over here! Fate took us straight
to the Leaf's Sannin. What do you want? We finally found him. We found Jiraiya Sensei. Damn! Enemies?! Run now! Nagato, go! But I couldn't truly accept
a Leaf Ninja. I'm sure you would understand why. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Origin of Pain

 Origin of Pain

Teach us ninjutsu. You're all ninja from
the Hidden Leaf, right? Thank you. This is for you. Shall I kill these children? Wha-?! I've seen many war orphans.
It's pitiful. They would be better off if we just put them out of
their misery right now. Orochimaru, enough! You go on ahead with Tsunade. I'll stay here and
look after them for a while. Huh?! It is the least I can do. My parents were killed by ninja
of the Hidden Leaf. - Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food! Grilled fish in an instant - with my Fire Style Jutsu.
- But Jiraiya Sensei seemed a little different than them. Sensei! I'm getting the hang
of fishing! Oh yeah? You're becoming
more and more promising! The four of us started living together. Soon after, a certain incident took place. Incident? Yahiko! A lingering ninja attacked us
and nearly killed Yahiko. That is when I struck out and
killed that ninja instead. And I did it...without realizing it. Are you all right, Yahiko?! It seems I possessed a special power. The Ocular Jutsu known
as the Rinnegan. As a result, Jiraiya Sensei, who had
been hesitant about training us, began to teach us ninjutsu. He said he was teaching us
so we could protect ourselves. But I think, in my case, it was so I could control
the power of the Rinnegan. But I was afraid of my power. Hate had caused me to go berserk. I thought what I did was wrong
and was consumed with guilt. But Sensei pulled me from the depths. Is it about that incident? That day... When that man hurt Yahiko,
I was so mad at him. Everything went blank in my head. I didn't know what I was doing. Before I realized it, the man was dead. After that, I got so scared. This hatred made me lose myself...
and I killed someone. What I did was wrong! There had to be a better way! Nagato! I really don't know if
it was right or wrong. But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die. You protected your friend. That had to be the right thing to do. No one can blame you for that. Before I realized it,
I had already accepted Sensei. When you are hurt, you learn to hate. On the other hand, when you hurt someone,
you are resented. But you start to feel guilty as well. However, understanding such pain
enables you to be kind to others. Knowing pain helps us to grow up,
to mature. And to grow up means
being able to think and make one's decisions
on their own. To know and reflect on pain,
and come up with your own answer. Jiraiya Sensei seemed to be
asking himself the same question. He hadn't found an answer either. Just like you haven't. Back then, I was able to come up
with an answer right away. I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. I see. What are you always pondering, Sensei? There is so much war
in this world. Only hatred exists.
I want to do something about it. And to know what the answer
to true peace is. Three years passed. I felt that I had grown stronger
physically and mentally through training. But Jiraiya Sensei's words always
kept coming back to me from somewhere deep inside. Sensei had told me that perhaps
the answer rested in my Rinnegan. Long ago, people constantly fought. Wars never ended.
It was an age far worse than today. In such an age, there appeared
a monk who, for the first time, preached the truth of chakra and
tried to bring peace to the world. It is said he traveled throughout
the world advocating his teachings, which he called ninshu. Time passed and ninshu
became known as ninjutsu. Ninjutsu isn't about armed power. It is a teaching that guides
people towards peace. This monk was known as
the Sage of the Six Paths and was called the savior of this world. Like you, he possessed the Rinnegan. "We are the ones who
create peace and order." Those are the monk's words. He must have believed that the era would come when people
truly understood each other. Maybe...you are the reincarnation
of that monk. I have a feeling that
those eyes of yours have been entrusted with
the monk's hopes. Sensei entrusted me with
the quest for peace, and then left us by ourselves. With Yahiko as our leader,
we began to take action. Our organization quickly gained fame. People approved of our efforts
to build peace without the use of force. But the world was at war. The Three Great Nations' War between
the Stone, Leaf and Sand villages. Hanzo, the leader of the Hidden Rain, heard rumors about our organization
and approached us. We couldn't be ignored anymore. He wanted to use us as
the axis to negotiate peace with the three Great Nations. We were to use our power
to secure an agreement of peace among the three nations. We agreed to cooperate with his proposal. But that was the beginning
of all of our misfortunes. We were naive children. Misfortunes? What happened? Because of that, Yahiko died. Died?! It was all a trap laid by Hanzo. He suspected that we would steal his power
over the Hidden Rain from him. For that reason alone,
Yahiko was... The following day, we went to a certain location
to make arrangements. Hanzo's subordinates and the Leaf's
Anbu Black Ops were already there. Hanzo had schemed with a man
named Danzo from the Hidden Leaf to get rid of us. Danzo teamed up with Hanzo in order
to usurp the seat of Hokage. Hanzo teamed up with Danzo
to protect his own position of power. Your organization is a nuisance to me. Yahiko... You are the leader, so you must die. If you resist, this woman will die. You! The red-haired one. Use that to kill Yahiko. Then I will spare you and the woman. Don't, Nagato! Never mind me! Both of you escape! Nagato. Kill me. I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. Nagato! No! Hurry it up. Or do you want this woman to die?! Konan... Yahi-! You and Konan must survive...
no matter what it takes. You are...the savior...of this world. I know... you can...do it. Yahiko! I have a huge dream! Kill them! If the fighting doesn't stop... I'll become the god of this world! He repelled it! How?! Did we get him? Nagato... Konan, hold onto Yahiko and stay still. Not bad, kid! You escaped even while being hit
by my Fire Style Jutsu! You're no ordinary kid. Those eyes... Get him! Summoning Jutsu! Gedo Statue! This is... What...is that?! Nagato... No! Don't use that! We're dead if that touches us! So you were the leader behind the scenes. It's quite a surprise that
you possess the Rinnegan. Nagato... Teleportation Jutsu! Yahiko died... And from then on, I took over
as the leader of our organization. I thought I had grown up. But nothing had changed at all. It was just like the time my parents died. I was wrong. I realized that the answer
I had come up with was nothing more than crap. I owed him my life.
He was my dream. He was my irreplaceable friend
for whom I would have gladly died. Yahiko's death... That was my second pain. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

 How did it turn out?

 It is as my vision foretold.

 Though I never thought
it would end like this.

 Perhaps in that moment when
Jiraiya chose not to give up,

 all this became preordained.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Tale of Naruto Uzumaki"

 This is my answer!

 It's been such a long time since all three of us got together! You're right about that. Not since we were reunited during
the invasion of Hidden Leaf Village. The days of the Ino-Shika-Cho Trio when we were renown
across the nations... That was so long ago. We're not has-beens yet! Say, why don't we do "that"
for old times' sake? Sounds good. Let's do it. Formation! Ino! - Shika!
- Cho! We've still got it! But you can't beat old comrades, eh? Huh? By the way, didn't we invite
someone else today? We ran into him yesterday. Oh yeah, we talked about
getting together for a meal. Who was it? Think hard! Forgetting a comrade is
the first sign of dementia! Sir... May I take your order? It's been two hours since I ordered. Huh?! I'm so sorry! I guess being forgotten
runs in the family. Tune in again!

 Yahiko died... And from then on, I took over as
the leader of our organization. Since that day, countless comrades
fought and died. One by one...
One after another... They continued to die. The peace-addled citizens
of the Land of Fire... The small commissions they pay to
the Hidden Leaf become war funds. The Land of Fire is fully aware
of having taken part in war, yet they falsely proclaim peace. The peace you great nations enjoy
only exists precariously atop the sacrifices of
us small nations. To us, your peace means violence. Just by living, people hurt others
without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists,
hate will also exist. True peace cannot exist in
this cursed world. Everything Jiraiya Sensei said
is wishful thinking! I have told you my story. Now let me hear your answer. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo Even in a world without you, I run. To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Tale of Naruto Uzumaki

 I have told you my story. Now let me hear your answer. TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA But I have faith that
there will come a time when people can truly understand
one another. You may be right. I also think the same way. I see... I get where you're coming
from now. But I still...
can't forgive you. I still hate you. Then you want to settle this? But... Pervy Sage believed in me,
and left me his quest. So I'm gonna believe in
Pervy Sage's belief. That's my answer. So...I won't kill you guys. You'll believe in what
Jiraiya Sensei believed? I see. So that's your answer. And do you expect us to wait... until you make this world
a peaceful place? Don't play with me! It's far too late for me to
believe Jiraiya's words! There's no such thing as true peace! As long as we live in
this cursed world peace is impossible! Then... Then...I'll break that curse. If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! You... That's... Nagato? What's wrong? Those...words... That's right. They're taken straight from this book. The first novel written
by Pervy Sage. Pervy Sage was seriously trying
to change the world with this. At the end of this book,
he wrote about a student who helped provide him
with inspiration. It was you, Nagato. No... Sensei... What's the matter? Is this a good time? Sure... I was trying to
start on my book, but I can't come up with any ideas. I figured I'd take a break
and get a bite to eat. So? What's going on? About what you once said to me
about the hatred in this world... I've been thinking about it. Oh yeah? Have you figured
anything out? Peace... I don't know how to
achieve peace yet. But... Some day, I'll break this curse. If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! There's something more important
than the method. It's the power to believe in it! I see... That's an excellent thought. You may very well be correct. What is it? Thanks to you, I think I'll be able
to write a fine novel! Now then... First, I've got to come up with
a name for the hero. Now I can return to my village
without any worries. You are on your own from now on. You've done well these
past three years! Don't cry, Yahiko. Or people will call you a coward. Konan... You're gonna grow up
to be a beauty. I'm looking forward to
seeing you again. This is a poor land. And there's more sadness and
tough times up ahead. But now, you have the strength
to change this land. Nagato... You three have grown up.
Don't you agree? Thank you, Sensei. Come on, stop crying Yahiko. I'm sure we'll see him again someday. Sensei... Why don't you give it up? This game of tag is getting boring. A Smoke Bomb?  Give it up. Can I say one thing? I don't care to listen! Die already! Give up... on me giving up! Even if you bring me down, another assassin will attack
the village. As long as we are cursed to
live in the Ninja World, there will be no peace. Then... I'll break that curse! If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! Wh-Who are you? My name is... My name is... Maybe you are the reincarnation
of that monk. I have a feeling that
those eyes of yours have been entrusted with
the monk's hopes. A certain sage gave me a prophecy... That one of my students will bring
about a great change in the Ninja World. And I will guide that revolutionary. I believe you are that person.
And I also believe in you. You are the savior of this world. I know...you can do it. It's the power to believe in it! Amazing, Yahiko! What a huge catch,
I'm impressed! Awesome, huh? It tastes great, doesn't it Nagato? Uh-huh. It's great. That looks tasty, Mother. Now eat up, Nagato. Okay. Rather than rule the world
through pain... I wish you had moved past the pain and harnessed your power to bring
about peace in a positive way. So I'm gonna believe
in Pervy Sage's belief. And...the name of the hero in this novel... His name is... Then I'll break that curse. If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! Wh-Who are you? My name is... Naruto! The name of the hero in this novel... is Naruto! My name is a precious keepsake
from Pervy Sage! I cannot just give up and stain
my master's keepsake! I will be the Hokage! And I will bring peace to
the Hidden Rain! Please believe in me! How? How can you say that
you will never change? That you will not change no matter how great
the pain you face. Can you continue believing
in yourself? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith
in yourself? I've experienced pain too... And there's a lot of pain nesting
inside of me as well. There's no telling what kind of pain
will come after me. But... TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

If I stop believing because of that... TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

If I stop believing because of that... If the hero should change it'll turn into another story. It'll turn into a different story from
the one my master left behind. Then it won't be Naruto! I can't write novels like my master did. That's why...the sequel has to come
from the life I live. No matter how great the pain,
I'll continue walking. Because that's who Naruto is! If the hero changes,
it'll turn into a different story. You and I are sibling disciples. As students of the same master, we ought to be able to understand
one another. That is what I said to you earlier. I meant it as a joke. You are a curious fellow. You remind me of how I once was. Nagato... I wasn't able to believe in Jiraiya. Nor...could I believe in myself. However... I have a feeling that,
unlike me, you will walk towards
a different future. I think I shall believe in you...
Naruto Uzumaki. Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth. Nagato don't! Konan... It's okay. I am making a new decision. A decision I had once given up on. What is it?
What kind of jutsu is that? Those who possess the Rinnegan
are able to manipulate the jutsu of all six Pains, and are said to exist outside
the realm of life and death. Nagato's ocular power is the jutsu
that controls life and death. He is the seventh Pain. Gedo... If he performs the jutsu at
his current chakra level... Nagato will not survive. He is willing to go that far
for this child...  This mysterious child has
changed Nagato.  It appears to have ended. How did it turn out? It is as my vision foretold. Although I never thought two
of Jiraiya's students would cross each other's paths
as the Child of Prophecy. Both becoming the ones to bring
about a great change to the Ninja World. Perhaps in that moment when
Jiraiya chose not to give up, all this became preordained. That book really became
the key to changing the world. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

 Konohamaru! You're alive.

 You too, Sensei!

 Ebisu Sensei, are you hurt?

 This is nothing.

 Konohamaru saved me.

 But never mind that.

 What is this phenomenon?

 Yes... What's going on?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hero of the Hidden Leaf"

 What just happened?

 Tune in again!

 Who would have thought that
both you and I would die so early? Although not as early as your mother. Father, I've always wanted
to ask you something. Why did someone like you, who was
known as the White Fang of the Leaf choose to ignore the village code and abandon a crucial mission
in order to save his comrades? If you had not done so, no one would have condemned you and
you wouldn't have become so miserable. I felt so bitter. I see...
You took it pretty hard, didn't you? Yeah. But you know, Father... Whatever the outcome,
I know you did your best. I can see that now
and I understand you. You broke the code to save everyone.
And I'm proud of you for it. Thank you. What is that?! What is that light?! Ma? Where am I? - Whoa!
- What's going on, Guy Sensei? I see! Lord Fukasaku was definitely dead! And yet...
What just happened?! I-Impossible!
How can such a thing occur?! What's going on? Iruka Sensei! - You're alive!
- You too, Sensei! Ebisu Sensei, are you hurt? This is nothing. Konohamaru saved me. But never mind my injury.
What is this phenomenon? Yes... What in the world?! It seems Naruto has settled things. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... Hero of the Hidden Leaf

 What? What just happened?! The villagers are coming back to life,
one after another. What?! You mean... I'll stay here and
look after them for a while. Just until they can take
better care of themselves. It's the least I can do. I'm still in time to revive those I've killed
since arriving in the Leaf Village. It's the least
I can do for them. What's this? Seems it was too soon for you
to come here. There must be something
you're still meant to do. Father... I'm glad we got to talk. Thank you for forgiving me. Now I can move on in peace. I'll finally be able to see your mother. - Pa!
- Yes. Kakashi too, eh? What's going on? Thank goodness!
I'm so glad, Kakashi Sensei! I will explain everything. You... War inflicts death, injury,
and pain to both sides. The death of someone dear
is hard to accept. We convince ourselves
there's no way they could die. It especially can't be helped
with your generation. You don't know war. You may try to find meaning in death,
but there is only pain. An unbearable hatred... Senseless deaths... Eternal hatred...
And pain that does not heal. That's what war is. Naruto... This is what you
will be facing in time. Regarding that book, and you... It feels like someone set it up. Or... Perhaps this is the real work of a god. It seems my work ends here, Naruto. I believe you can bring true peace. You're taking this one with you too? Yes... Tendo Pain was created
from Yahiko's body. He is very precious to us. So he was...Yahiko. So what are you going to do? I hate to think that
you're returning to the Akatsuki. I'm leaving the Akatsuki. Yahiko and Nagato meant
everything to me. Yahiko's dream... And Nagato's dream... If both of their dreams have been
passed on to you, then you now embody their dreams. Nagato put his faith in you.
So will I. We, the Hidden Rain,
will pursue their dreams with you. If I can't find the answer,
perhaps I'll entrust you to find it! I think I shall believe in you...
Naruto Uzumaki. The name Naruto, the guts to never give up,
and pain. That's what I inherited from my teacher
and sibling disciple! This time... I pray that you will be the blossom of hope
that never wilts. Just you watch, Master! MASTER


TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

 Good job. Kakashi Sensei... Just lean on me. He's gotten heavy. Hmm? Welcome back! We knew you could do it! They've all been awaiting your return. My dream is to surpass the Hokage! And make everyone in
the village acknowledge me! Naruto... You did well. Welcome back! Naruto! Wh-What's going on? I relayed every detail of
the events that occurred. Hey! What was the enemy like? Are you hurt? Oww! Don't push! I'm so glad, Naruto. Hey! Cut it out! Sakura... You're so reckless, you idiot! Thank you. Way to go, Naruto. Yes! That's what youth is! I can't believe
he pulled it off all by himself. Uh-huh... I could almost fall for him. - Huh?!
- Huh?! Ain't he something, that Naruto. That's my classmate! He really outclassed us. Shut up.
We'll make it up starting now! Let's join them, Iruka Sensei! No, I'm fine right here. - But...
- Now, now... Naruto is amazing, isn't he? At first, everyone thought he was
such a nuisance, including myself. We feared his destiny,
so we kept him at arm's length and didn't bother with him. That fox kid shouldn't
become a ninja! What is the Third Hokage thinking?! That Team Kakashi...  I heard they defeated
the terrorist Zabuza! Sounds like the Nine-Tails kid
had a part in it... No way...
I heard he was a loser. I bet it was Kakashi's doing. I hear that Nine-Tails kid made it
to the Finals of the Chunin Exam. Are you serious?!
He's more skilled than I thought. Humph! I just hope the fox demon
doesn't go on a rampage. Oh! That's that fox kid? I can't believe he won against a Hyuga. That was an awesome match! I never expected such
a battle from the fox kid. He's quite a boy. However, he never ever gave up. And he stayed true to his Ninja Way. And slowly, but surely
we couldn't help but acknowledge him. D-Da... Damn it! I heard he protected the village from
the Sand Jinchuruki! Who did? Naruto Uzumaki.
You know, the one... I'm so glad the Fifth Hokage
has been decided! We can breathe a little easier now. Thanks to Lord Jiraiya and Naruto! Is it true they fought Orochimaru? I heard they couldn't bring
Sasuke Uchiha back. I hope Naruto isn't too depressed. A group named the Akatsuki
is after the Jinchuriki. Which means Naruto will
also be targeted. Will he be okay? Lord Jiraiya will look out
for Naruto. I heard that Naruto rescued
the Sand's Kagekaze from the Akatsuki! Wouldn't it be great if this results
in an alliance between the Leaf and Sand? The Akatsuki has killed Lord Jiraiya! Is Naruto all right?! Naruto has
Lord Jiraiya's determination! He hasn't lost heart! He'll keep on going, like always! Today, everyone trusts Naruto implicitly. They worry about him, have high hopes
for him and pray for him. He truly changed the hearts
of many people. It's because he did his best. Iruka... Yes, Lord Hokage? I agree with you to a point, but he is just like you. He never knew parental love and because of that incident,
people avoided him. So in order to get attention,
he resorted to mischief. In whatever shape or form, he desperately wanted to validate
his existence and his worth. The Fourth Hokage wanted the villagers
to regard Naruto as a hero. He placed the seal and
died hoping for that. Third Hokage... Fourth Hokage... There is a hero right before our eyes. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

Please let me think about this.

 As you can see, everyone is troubled by
Naruto's mischief.

 No one wants to take him.

 But sir...

 One cannot become a ninja unless
they graduate from the academy!

 If Naruto cannot get a teacher,

 then I have no choice but to have him
leave the academy.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Rookie Instructor Iruka"

 That child, of all things.

 Tune in again!

 Iruka... Yes, Lord Hokage? I agree with you to a point, but he is just like you. He never knew parental love and because of that incident,
people avoided him. So in order to get attention,
he resorted to mischief. In whatever shape or form, he desperately wanted to validate
his existence and his worth. The Fourth Hokage wanted
the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero. He placed the seal
and died hoping for that. Third Hokage... Fourth Hokage... There is a hero
right before our eyes. I never imagined
that Pain would be defeated. We must notify Tobi. Let's go. What'll we do? What, tired already?
We just left the village. That's not it... I was thinking about Lord Raikage. We'll save Bee,
no matter what it takes! We will save him!  - Lord Raikage!
 - Lord Raikage! What if Lord Raikage is still crying and his tears are forming
into a pond, and then into a lake? What if, by the time
we return to the village, the place has become humid
like the Hidden Rain? What'll we do then? Huh? That's impossible. Tears can't create a lake,
no matter how hard one cries. But we're talking about Lord Raikage. He has so much power, creating a lake is probably
a piece of cake. In fact, forget a lake.
He could probably create an ocean. And if a giant wave from
that ocean swallowed us up... What'll we do-? Shut up! Enough already. Your imagination wears me out! I can understand Samui
getting tired because of the weight
of her giant boobs. But how can you get tired, Karui?
You don't even have boobs. Shut up! Come on, you two,
we're just starting our mission. It'll take us at least four or five days
to get to the Leaf Village. Do you plan on keeping
this up the whole trip? We can't afford to waste any time! So let's move it! Right! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... - Leaf's History -
Rookie Instructor Iruka


 Look at the devastation. I guess class will be held
outside for quite a while. Let's see if we can salvage anything
that can be used in class. Yes, that's something we can do. All right, let's split up in
each direction. Scatter! This area is totally destroyed too. This tree... It survived. Here I go! Bombs away! Bull's eye! Red-nosed Hokage complete! He is incorrigible. Third Hokage,
please let me think about this. About becoming
Naruto's homeroom teacher. As you can see, Iruka, everyone is troubled by
Naruto's mischief. And his pranks are
getting worse each day. No one wants to take him. I believe a teacher's job is
to enhance a student's virtues. If Naruto does not graduate
from the Academy, he will not be able to
become a ninja. He will remain an outcast to
this village for the rest of his life. Just a minute... I'm sure
there is someone else fit for Naruto. If Naruto cannot get a teacher,
then I have no choice but to have him leave
the Academy. Don't let it bother you.
No one can blame you. And even if that happens,
it certainly isn't your fault. Please wait. What? Then you'll accept? Uh... Err...Yes. Oh... Is that so? This is a lifesaver for Naruto. Keep wiping until every speck
of graffiti is gone! Oh look... It's that thing. Why do we let that boy
stay in this village? I wish Lord Hokage would have
more consideration for us. Shut up! Hey! Come back! I'm not "that thing"! I'm Naruto Uzumaki! I'm gonna be the Hokage one day! It's just a dream... That's right! I'm supposed to get
a new homeroom teacher today. The first impression is important. I should give him a proper greeting. I'm gonna raise hell again today! NINJA ACADEMY

- 'Morning!
- Hi! FACULTY ROOM Iruka Sensei. I understand you'll be
Naruto's homeroom teacher. Yes. I had no choice since
the Third Hokage requested it. You got the short end
of the stick, didn't you? Frankly, I don't know
how to go about this. Well, he certainly is a handful. Just treat Naruto appropriately.
Just do what works. What works? Yes. Just go about your way,
without making a fuss. If you don't bother with them, kids tend to go away
on their own. What works, huh? Who did this?! Of all the mischief... Gotcha! Gotcha! The eraser was just a decoy. Naruto! Just do what works. Naruto... I know, I know.
I'll go stand in the hallway. No, go and take your seat. Huh? What a letdown. I was looking forward to
seeing Naruto get scolded. Sheesh! How boring... 'Morning! First, let me introduce myself! I'll be your homeroom teacher
starting today. I'm Iruka Umino. My favorite food is Ichiraku Ramen. My least favorite food
is mixed rice. I was born on May 26,
so I'm a Pisces. My hobbies include
going to the hot springs... NINJA ACADEMY Therefore, one's chakra
is greatly influenced by their mental energy. Just go about your way,
without making a fuss. Huh? Sensei... Class time is over. See? Look. Oh, it's that time already. Well then, that's all for today. How's that for Naruto's third prank? See! Owww... You found out already? Return to your seat. Let's continue the lesson. Okay then...
Instead of self-introductions, I want each of you to demonstrate
your ninjutsu skill! You're not going to be graded. This is just so I can assess how
to proceed with our lessons. So... We'll do a basic jutsu.
Clone Jutsu. Umm... First up is Sasuke Uchiha. - Go ahead and try it.
- Sasuke! Clone Jutsu is child's play. You always act so smug! Shut up, idiot. Don't interrupt Sasuke's focus! That's right! You're in the way! Not you too, Sakura. Okay, Sasuke. Try it. Clone Jutsu! Hmm... Amazing!
That was a perfect Clone Jutsu. I can't tell which one is real. It's so obvious to me! This one! Wrong. H-Huh?! - Stupid! Hey, that's the real one.
- What are you doing?! Wrong again. Sasuke! Amazing, two clones in an instant
while the real one moved elsewhere. Humph! I can do Clone Jutsu too! Clone Jutsu! This guy's such an idiot! Damn it... I don't know what your problem is,
but quit lunging at me. He's right. I say that because every time
you do something, you hold up our lesson. And that is an annoyance. What?! Yeah, you're an annoyance! You're a germ for just being alive! That's cruel, Hibachi. But he's right! What?! Everyone! Quit making fun of Naruto! Sensei! Don't bother...with this kid. Huh? C'mon, everyone.
Let's continue our lesson. - Okay.
- Okay. - Let's go.
- I'm gonna do my best. I'm gonna show all of them!
I swear! Clone Jutsu! Wha-? Damn it! Once more! N-Naruto... ICHIRAKU RAMEN What's the matter, Naruto? Nothing... Want some ramen? No thanks... I got no money. You can pay me back
when you're rich. Besides, the stove's still on. Really? Yeah... All right! You seem depressed.
Something wrong? No, it's nothing! I'm my usual self! NINJA ACADEMY All right. Today, we'll do hands-on practice
of Shuriken Jutsu. Let's have someone
demonstrate it for us first. Let's see... - Me! Me! Me!
- I can do it! - Leave it to me.
- I'll do it in one try! - Me! Me! Me!
- I can do it! Shino, go ahead! Iruka Sensei,
you chose the wrong person. The reason is, for all forms of warfare, the Aburame Clan relies greatly on the parasitic insects
we house in our bodies. And the Shuriken Jutsu
is simply not in our... Okay, enough! Sasuke, show us the basics. - Sasuke!
- Do your best! Go for it! Sheesh! That Sasuke always
acts arrogant! So how come he's so popular?! Hmm... Well done, Sasuke. - All right, Sasuke!
- You're so cool! Hah! Show off!
I can do that too! Then Naruto, you're next. All right! I'll show you! I'll do it in one throw, and make
everyone take notice of me. Go! Are you kidding me?
Every one of them missed! I was just fooling around! Sensei! One more!
Just let me do it one more time! I'll get serious this time. No, that's enough. Okay, who's next? Say Shikamaru, want to go to
the candy store after class? No way. You're okay because
your mom's nice. But if my mom finds out that
I had a snack before dinner, I'll get it. Did you hear? Everyone in the Uchiha clan
got killed. Yeah... I heard my dad talking. He's the only one who survived. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de The Nine-Tails sealed inside
of Naruto is responsible

 for the death of my parents.

 I'm fully aware that
Naruto is not to blame.

 But whenever I see him,

 I can't stop from
remembering the Nine-Tails

 hiding deep inside of him.

 I don't think Naruto would open up
to someone like me.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Iruka's Ordeal"
 

 "-Leaf's History-
Iruka's Ordeal"



Third Hokage sure made
a bold decision. Tune in again!

 - Let's go!
- Okay! Hey guys. What're you all doing? What? Stay away, Naruto. Why? Why can't I? Let me play with you guys too. Why should we?! No way will you join us in
tonight's test of courage. Test of courage? Ow! What're you babbling about? Wow, sounds like fun! I'm coming too! We told you, you can't! Get this!
Don't you dare follow us! Come on! Get this! Don't you dare follow us! When you say something like that, Naruto here will follow,
no matter what it takes. Hey, is that the boy? Yes... That's the one. Now then...
How can I scare them? Oh! You brat! Huh? Go away! What's the big idea?! What are you doing here?!
You plague! What? I was only... I was only looking
at the masks. Naruto? You want this?! Well, you can have it.
Now get lost! Jeez... What?! Why are you all looking
at me like that? Sheesh, you're all wimps. No one's brave enough
to go all the way in? Don't say that... Well then, I'll go. This is easy. All I have to do is take that branch. A fox demon! Huh? What's going on?! A fox demon! What?! Serves them right. Everyone got scared and ran off. You better hurry and run, Sensei.
Or else, I'll eat you to death! Dad... Mom... Is everything okay? It's all right. You must follow
the guide and evacuate. Don't worry. We Advance Troops
won't let the Nine-Tails set a single step
into the village. Go beat up that Nine-Tails. You got it. Please look after him. Yes. Bye then. Good luck! Bad news! The Advance Troops
have been defeated! What?! Then the Advance Troops
are all dead?! The Advance Troops...
All dead? It's not true... I-It can't be true.
My mom and dad... wouldn't die! Huh? What's up, Sensei? Naruto... Do you realize
what you're doing? Why? Why?! Why does everyone,
even my homeroom teacher... Why do you all look at me like that?! I'm not a nuisance and
I'm not some kind of germ! I'm... I'm Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto... I'll never...
return to the Academy again! Hey! Damn it! What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... -Leaf's History-
Iruka's Ordeal

 Good morning, everyone! - Good morning!
- Good morning! All right, let me take attendance. Naruto's not here? Sakura. Do you know? Oh... I didn't notice. Oh yeah, I don't think
I saw him this morning. Kiba, have you seen him? Huh? Nope. Besides, I have no interest in him.
Right, Akamaru? Fine then. Let's begin our class. But, why? Lord Hokage is performing
official duties right now. Why won't the Third Hokage
agree to see me? That's not our concern. We have our orders.
No one is permitted to enter. Hey, hey! You know, this is my special seat. I can't concentrate on my reading when someone's making such
a loud sigh next to me. Oh...I'm sorry. I'll move away now. No, wait. I was just about to leave. Be seeing you... What's wrong?
You look so depressed. If you feel like talking, I'll listen. - Kakashi...
- Hmm? is your name, right? Well, I happen to be Naruto's...
you know the one... Naruto Uzumaki's homeroom teacher. I see... But I went to ask
the Third Hokage to relieve me from being his homeroom teacher. Lord Hokage wouldn't see me. I just don't know how... I don't know how to deal with Naruto. I'm not qualified to teach Naruto! I see. So that's why you look so dead. What? I'm talking about your eyes. Kakashi... How is it that
you were there and yet...? Forgive me. I made a formation error.
I should have kept him with me. Ah... Iruka, how are your wounds? Yes... It was just a minor injury.
Thank you for your concern. You worked hard.
Take some time off to recuperate. Lord Hokage...
I was responsible for this incident. The team leader is not... I fully understand
without you telling me. Yes sir! Iruka... You've always been
a kind person. I believe that kindness of yours
proved detrimental during a crucial moment
against the enemy ninja. There may come a time when that trait puts
your comrades' lives in danger. Yes. I thought I was well aware
of my own personality, but... Well, what's done is done.
For your next mission... Lord Hokage! Actually... I'd like to speak
to you about that. What is it? Speak freely. I wonder if you recall... After I lost my parents, you spoke to me in front of
the stone monument of heroes. You told me about
the Will of Fire. Yes, I remember it well. Because of your words, I was able to concentrate on
my training and my duties. The lesson you taught me
about the Will of Fire... I'd like to pass it on to
the next generation of ninja. What? You want to become
an instructor at the Academy? Yes, if I may sir! Well then, starting tomorrow, you shall be an assistant instructor
at the Academy. Really, Lord Hokage?! Your eyes were full of life back then.
Now they're dead. Perhaps you've forgotten
a basic rule of teaching. "You cannot open the mind of another
unless you yourself have an open mind." Or perhaps you're trying to forget. The Nine-Tails sealed inside
of Naruto is responsible for the death of my parents. I'm fully aware that Naruto
is not to blame. But whenever I see him, I can't stop remembering
the Nine-Tails hiding deep inside of him. I don't think Naruto would
open up to someone like me. You are the only one
who can reach Naruto's heart. That... That is your personal ordeal. Ordeal?! Yes, one that Lord Hokage
has given you. Just hang in there a little longer,
and you will find the way. Rise up to his expectations. See you. Third Hokage sure made
a bold decision. Koji! Time to go home! - Daichi! Dinnertime!
- Okay. Let's go home, everyone. Mom! What are you doing?
I told you not to play with that boy. Come on, let's go! Shikamaru, let's go! Oh, Dad... Choji's with you? We'll walk him home. Let's go. - See you, Naruto.
- Bye. Y-Yeah. Dad! Let go of my hand! What's there to be embarrassed about? Thank you for the food. Let go!
Mom and Dad are still fighting! Damn it! Ow... Who is it...so early in the morning? What?! Iruka Sensei?!
What's he doing here?! Naruto! Naruto! I'm coming in. This is all he eats? Thank you for the food. You're going to stop at
Choji's house, aren't you? Hurry up and eat, then. Yeah... Say Dad? Can I ask you something? What is it? Why does everyone avoid Naruto
like he's the plague? Did he do something wrong? Shikamaru... How do you feel
about that boy? H-How do I feel?
Well, I never thought about it. He's stupid,
but he's a funny guy. It's not like we're gonna be buddies,
but I wouldn't avoid him either. I see... Then you should do what
you want to do. Yeah, I guess so. I have so much time now
that I'm not going to the Academy. Huh? What do you guys want? Hey. That's Naruto, right? Naruto, you can join our group. Huh?! Are you serious? Yeah. But in order to be one of us,
there's a condition. What is it? Yesterday, my dad's patrol unit had
a fight with enemy ninja in the back hills. He said they left
the corpses out there. Find that corpse and bring back
one of its belongings. If you do, you can join us. Is that for real? Yeah. All right then! I'll bring back
something for sure. You can bet on it! He's such an idiot. Dad said the enemy might
still be out there. That's mean... Hibachi, you're still upset about
the test of courage incident, aren't you? Never mind that.
Did you see his happy face? He didn't have a clue that it's a trick. NINJA ACADEMY Has anyone seen Naruto? Nope, didn't see him. Naruto went into the back hills. Shikamaru?! What're you talking about? In the back hills? To look for corpses...
Right, Hibachi? Your tricks are annoying. We're having study hall today! - What?
- What's going on? I'll finally get to have friends! When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de Iruka Sensei, did you hear?

 Last night, a battle broke out
in the back hills.

 Battle?

 It seems enemy spies appeared.

 The patrol unit killed one of them
and collected its corpse.

 Then it's best not to let
the students go near the back hills.

 There still may be enemies
looming around.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Iruka's Decision"

 "- Leaf's History -
Iruka's Decision"
 


I hope nothing happens... Tune in again!

 Iruka Sensei... Did you hear the news? Hear what? Last night, there was a battle
in the back hills. A battle? Yes. Apparently, there were foreign spies. The Patrol Unit defeated one of them
and brought in her body. In that case, the students shouldn't
go near the back hills today. Yes. There may still be spies there. I hope nothing happens. The corpse... The corpse... Where is it? I know this area well,
since I always play here, but... Maybe I should have asked
the guys for a more exact location. Naruto! Sensei! What are you doing?!
Get back to the Academy, now! I don't want to!
I won't go to the Academy anymore! There are still dangerous people here! I won't go back even if you beg me to! Do as I say.
I'm your homeroom teacher! Shut up! Why do you only act like
a teacher at times like this? You don't understand my feelings. Even if I go back to the Academy,
things won't be any different! I'm always alone. I'm always left out. Nobody cares about me! But this time, it'll be different! If I bring back some items,
everyone will accept me as their friend! If I do that, I won't be alone anymore! I won't have to experience
that feeling ever again! That's why I'm going to find
and bring back an item! Please try to understand... No matter what your reasons may be,
as your teacher, I cannot allow you to go
to such a dangerous area. You really don't understand my feelings. Killer attack! Sexy Jutsu! W-Wait! Honestly, grown-ups are so easy to trick! This is the aftermath of a battle. That means it should be nearby. Can't find anything. Come to think of it,
I haven't eaten anything today. I should get something to eat. I found lunch! What's this? Ooh! I've never seen one shaped
like this before. The enemy ninja must have used
this kunai during battle yesterday. I found an item to bring back! That kunai... The secret documents
we've been looking for! I see... She placed it in that nest
before she was defeated. All right! Don't let him get away! Where did he go? Well, he certainly is a handful. Just treat Naruto appropriately.
Just do what works. Don't bother...with this kid. Naruto's right.
I didn't try to understand him at all. After the death of my parents, there was no one left to
praise or accept me. I did a lot of stupid things in class. I wanted to get people's attention. He's... the same as I was back then. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... - Leaf's History -
Iruka's Decision

 Hey, Shikamaru,
could you lend me money? Not again... You're not spending all
your allowance on snacks, are you? Huh? I never thought of using it
on anything other than snacks. Jeez. Oh well. I'll lend you some. Say, you two... Isn't class in session? Who are you? I can't talk to strangers.
My dad will get mad at me. I see, Shikamaru Nara
and Choji Akimichi. How do you know our names? You're the sons of Shikaku
and Chouza, right? You look very much like them. Perhaps I should tell them
that you skipped class. Tell them? But we have
a free period, right, Shikamaru? A free period? Naruto went to look for
a corpse in the back hills, so Iruka Sensei went after him. Iruka Sensei went after Naruto? Is that true? Yeah. There's no mistake. Listen, having a free period doesn't
mean you don't have school. Go back to the Academy right now. Okay... Now I'll be able to make friends! Hey, kid. What? Who are all of you? Hand over that kunai, nice and easy. N-No way! I can't hand this over! I see. It looks like we have
to take it by force. Huh?! What? W-Wait a second. Naruto! Sexy Jutsu! What?! Unfortunately, that technique
won't work on us! Huh? No way! They're all women?! That's not fair. In that case... Clone Jutsu! Even if he is a kid, this is the first time I've seen
such a poorly made clone. Don't let him get away!
Don't show him any mercy! If my ninjutsu won't work... Don't let him get away! What?! I know all the hunting traps
in this forest! Hurry! Here they come! Curses! How could we fall
for such a simple trap! That brat! Umm... Where was the other one? Naruto! Sensei? I'm over here! Hey! Are you all right? Pull yourself together!
Are you hurt?! You've regained consciousness. Sensei... Come on, we're going back
to the Academy! Those guys! What are you outsiders doing
sneaking around the Leaf Village! Who are you? Leave that kid with us,
and don't put up a fight! I'm in charge of this child.
I can't do that. What, you're a teacher? It must be tough having
such a bad student. Because of that,
you're going to die. It's the bad ones that
you get attached to. Besides, you won't be able
to defeat me so easily. Naruto! Hang in there! Quickly! Surround them! Die! I will protect Naruto,
no matter what it takes! Don't let him get away!
Scatter! Multi Phantom Shuriken Jutsu! I can't dodge all of them! - What?!
- What?! Are both of you all right? Kakashi! Why are you here? Your students told me
what happened. I was a little concerned. Damn it... He's got back-up! It doesn't matter.
We just need to get rid of them all! Fire Style: Synergy Jutsu! Go, Iruka! - Karura!
- Karura! Kakashi! One down. What?! Lightning Blade! Thank you very much. I don't know what would have
happened if you hadn't shown up. You would have protected Naruto
even if I hadn't come. I think I understand what
you were talking about. I didn't try to be upfront with him. I was probably trying to
turn my back on him. But I think I can finally
face him now. I see. That's good. Yes! This is the Leaf Village's
patrol network. So this is what they were
looking into? Yes. Good work. I'll tell the Patrol Unit to reexamine
their village patrol activities right away. Please do. Even if it was a coincidence, it looks like Naruto's recklessness
saved the village. You may leave. Yes, sir. What's wrong? Lord Hokage... Umm... Thank you for placing me
in charge of Naruto. Because of that, I remembered
why I wanted to become a teacher. Lord Hokage... It was because of something
you said to me long ago. It's already been a year, huh? Smiling while hiding
your sadness isn't easy, is it? I heard from your teacher that
you're the center of laughter. I'm not sad! It's an honor for a ninja
to die on a mission! Mom and Dad sacrificed their lives
to protect the village  from that demon fox.  They're heroes! I'm the son of heroes!
I'm not sad that I'm alone! These are tears of happiness. That's enough. I know that you crawl into
a ball when you're by yourself. But you are not alone. The ninja of the Hidden Leaf
carry the Will of Fire in them. Will of Fire? It's the strong will to protect this village. As long as you have
the Will of Fire in you, everyone in the village
is your family. Iruka... Do you have that? Yes! I wish to pass on your Will of Fire
to the children of the future, to Naruto. Sensei! How could you lose the item
that I found?! You idiot! Huh? You almost lost your life today! That's true, but... Hm? You're awfully quiet today. That's because this is
the first time you've yelled at me. I'm surprised. Oh... I see. That's right. I decided that
I would be upfront with you. Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to be strict with you! What?! That makes me want
to go to the Academy even less! Naruto... Do you have
the Will of Fire in you? Will of Fire? What's that? It's the strong will
to protect this village. If you have it, you can become
as strong as Lord Hokage. The Hokage?
Is the Hokage that strong? Yeah. He's not just strong, either. Everyone in the village
respects Lord Hokage. He is our leader. The Fourth Hokage was a hero who
protected the village from the demon fox. A hero? All right, I've made up my mind! I'm going to become a Hokage
who's stronger than the Fourth Hokage! I'm going to make everyone
acknowledge my strength! You might become the Hokage
by the time you become this tall. Yeah! I'm going to work really hard
to become the Hokage! Naruto... You really might
become the Hokage. Iruka Sensei, please help us out with this. Okay. I'm coming right away! Where's Suigetsu? Suigetsu? Who knows? He went out two or three days ago
and hasn't come back. I don't mind if he never comes back. I can hear you! The Executioner's Blade...
You still have that? You left it behind! It was a pain
to go back and retrieve it. Why should I carry your things
while fighting the Eight-Tails?! I carried the two of you out of there
when you were dying. So quit fighting. That's so patronizing! Fine. Whatever the case, I got it back. I don't feel right without this. We're all here.
I want all of you to prepare to leave. Huh? Are your wounds all right? Yeah. We're going to the Leaf Village. And that's the whole story. I never expected Pain to be defeated. This is unexpected. Konan isn't coming back here anymore. What should we do?
We have so many vacant positions. We need another pawn who can
synchronize with the Gedo Statue. Kisame... You go look for the Eight-Tails. What about you? I have slightly different
business to attend to. This is... I wasn't expecting this. You're late. Did Naruto do it? No, it was Pain's doing. Pain?! But Naruto handled it.
He defeated Pain. Naruto did that?!
What about the Nine-Tails? He was able to control it on his own. I see... What? Naruto controlled
the Nine-Tails on his own?! There's no time to be surprised. Rebuilding the village
is going to be hard work. Yamato, we're going to need your help. Okay! What is it? An emergency council has been called. As Jonin Squad Leader, your presence is also required
at the Feudal Lord's palace, Lord Shikaku. Already? All right. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the

 He's a fool, but it would be best
if you looked after him.

 Sure...

 Sasuke Uchiha is also
in your group.

 I'm not naïve enough
to go easy on them because of personal feelings.

 I know. I wish you the best of luck.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kakashi Hatake, The Jonin in Charge"

 This looks like it's going
to be troublesome.


 Tune in again!

 Regarding the Akatsuki, we intend to continue pursing them
with assistance from our allied nations. With everything that's happened
to your village, we of the Land of Fire shall also provide
full support in rebuilding the village. First, we need to put together a budget. Then, we need to ease tensions
between other nations. More importantly... There's something
we must attend to first. The selection of a new Hokage. I knew it would come to this. Don't you think we should just
wait until Tsunade recovers? Lord... Tsunade remains in
a comatose state. The village is in ruins, and we don't know
when Tsunade will awaken. We're having a difficult time deciding
what line of action to take. Plus, she is responsible for bringing about
the destruction of the Leaf Village! I always thought that Jiraiya
would be next. I liked him,
but he's no longer here. So, who else is there? In that case, I... I recommend Kakashi Hatake! The son of the White Fang, huh? Yes! Why not? What do the rest of you think? Indeed... He's renowned, powerful,
and virtuous. But perhaps a bit too young? I believe Minato, the Fourth Hokage,
was younger. Who was Kakashi Hatake's master? The Fourth Hokage. DISCIPLE Is that so? If I'm not mistaken... DISCIPLE

Jiraiya was
the Fourth Hokage's master and DISCIPLE


the Third Hokage was Jiraiya's master! There seems to be no problem at all,
is there? All right! Well then... The Third Hokage's teachings are
practically what annihilated the village! Akatsuki's leader,
the one who destroyed the village, was once Jiraiya's student. This is what happens when
one sympathizes with foreigners and teaches them ninjutsu! They're naïve! All of them! That naïveté throughout the ages allowed
our ally, the Sand Village, to betray us and allowed Orochimaru to lead
a campaign to destroy the Hidden Leaf. It allowed the rise of the Akatsuki and
allowed Sasuke, a survivor of the Uchiha, to go rogue and work underground! What sort of Hokage
do we need now?! Someone who can handle the aftermath
of this terrible situation, and change the Ninja World
by enforcing ninja laws. I will become a Hokage
like no other! Lord... Why don't we allow Danzo to
handle this for the time being? A rigid and one-sided way
of doing things is not- Yes, I've made up my mind. Danzo... I appoint you as Sixth Hokage! She used Lady Katsuyu's jutsu
to protect everyone. She's been unconscious ever since. We honestly don't know when
she'll regain consciousness. Granny... Hey, Sakura! Whoa! Let me go draw water for you. Then let's go together. Sakura... Don't get the wrong idea. If I left it up to you, who knows
where you'd draw water. You can trust me a little more than that. Naruto... Who would have imagined? We're going to be late, you two. I'll get you for this! Team 7 genin will be Sakura Haruno,
Sasuke Uchiha, and Naruto Uzumaki. Sasuke and Naruto...
Those two on the same team?! I will be placing Kakashi Hatake
in charge of this team. Kakashi? It's said that Kakashi has never passed
any genin he has been placed in charge of. Is the Third Hokage trying
to crush Naruto? And Sasuke on top of that? Couldn't be... Got that, Kakashi? Sure. Team 8... Hinata Hyuga,
Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame. Kurenai Yuhi will be in charge
of these three. Yes, sir! Kurenai, this is your first time
in charge of genin, isn't it? The jonin in charge will
decide their future. Yes. I will be careful with them. The genin of Squad 10... Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,
and Choji Akimichi. I'm placing Asuma Sarutobi
in charge of them. Understood! What do you think? This should be difficult
for even you to handle. I'm not so sure about that. Now then... I think I should
start attacking again. It's tough for soldiers like us
to do anything when our generals are running about. Hey! T-Time out! There are no time outs
on real missions. I'm a pawn. You're the equivalent of
a silver general in Japanese chess. I'm only able to perform
my duty under your protection. What are you saying? If you're a pawn,
I'm just a sacrificial piece. No. Pawns are able to do their work
because you're there for us. You got me there. Speaking of which,
did you find an answer? An answer?
Oh, you mean to that riddle? At first, I thought it was
the Feudal Lord or the Hokage. But now, I get the feeling
that's not everything. Take care of my kid. What did I really lose that day? ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke For the life of me, I can't remember. tou ni wasureteshimatta yo We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight... yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home. sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita Weak, frail souls lost in the world... dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro We act strong to hide their fragility. tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru So farewell, but even forced apart... sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on. bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara Even in a world without you, I run. kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo To someday get past the pain. itsuka no itami mo koete koete Someday... - Leaf's History -
Kakashi Hatake, 
The Jonin in Charge
 So this is Naruto's room. That's right. This milk is far past its expiration date. He's a fool, but it would be best
if you looked after him. You have good instincts. Sure. Sasuke Uchiha is also on your team. Kakashi... You were a student
of the Fourth Hokage and you possess the Sharingan. Who would have thought that you would
end up looking after these two? I'm not so naïve that I'd go easy
on them because of personal feelings. I know. I wish you the best of luck! Understood. This looks like it's going
to be troublesome. NINJA WAY Sakura looks completely infatuated
with him. What's so great about him?
I just don't get it. Naruto, you bastard!
Don't glare at Sasuke! Out of the way! Get him, Sasuke! That's right! What? No way! Oh! Sorry! NINJA WAY We've been waiting for you. It should not have taken you this long
to designate team leaders. I was showing Naruto's apartment
to Kakashi. About that... Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha
are on the same team?! Furthermore, I hear that you've placed
Kakashi Hatake in charge of them. Yes. I think he's right for the job. It doesn't matter if
he's right for the job! What do you plan to do if
Naruto is on a mission and that thing inside of him goes wild? That's not all. There is the danger that he might
be the target of outsiders as well. Shouldn't we confine Naruto
within the village? Furthermore, you teamed Naruto up
with Sasuke. Are you plotting to give the Uchiha
control over the Nine-Tails? Good idea, Hiruzen. Next is Team 7. Sakura Haruno.
Naruto Uzumaki! All right! And Sasuke Uchiha. Cha! Iruka Sensei! I'm totally brilliant! So why am I
on the same team as him?! Sasuke graduated with
the best scores of all 27 graduates. Naruto, you were the worst! This is just the result of our effort
to balance the teams. Try not to get in the way, loser! What was that?! Jeez, Naruto! Cut it out! Ouch! Ow ow ow!
Ouch, stop Sakura! Stop! It's true that in the world of ninja,  those who break the rules and
regulations are regarded as scum. But... those who abandon
their comrades...are worse than scum! Before we part...
I'll tell you one more thing. For a ninja, the most important thing
is teamwork. So that one was Naruto. Sakura, there's something
I want to ask you. Huh? Oh! Well... What do you think of Naruto? Naruto? He's always interfering with my love life. He enjoys making me suffer. Naruto doesn't understand
anything about me. He's just annoying. I just...want you to accept me. I'm desperate. I'd do anything for you to accept me. That's because I love you, Sasuke. S-Sakura... I... Sasuke? I-I'll be right back. That look on his face... I'll bet he drank it. I won't be able to make it! That was close. Oh! Honestly! You're so shy, Sasuke. Are you ready now? I'm all ready! It's almost time.
Where is Naruto? Oh there you go again,
changing the subject like that. Never mind Naruto! He's always picking fights with you! It's probably because
he's never been raised properly! He doesn't have any parents, you know! That's why he always gets
to do whatever he wants! If I tried to do that,
my parents would get mad at me! It's so nice to be alone!
You don't have parents to pester you. That's why he gets to be
as selfish as he is. Loneliness... Huh? It's far worse than feeling sad
because your parents scolded you! Wh-What's wrong?
What's this about? You're annoying. Hey! Why are you here?! We ninja have something called
an Escape Jutsu. Remember that, loser. Why...you... Sakura? Sasuke's words seem to have
hurt her pretty badly. I wonder if this is what Naruto felt like. Sakura's really depressed. Sasuke! Naruto... He doesn't understand at all. Hey, Sasuke! You said something mean
to Sakura, didn't you?! Not really. Liar! If you didn't, there's no way
that she'd get that depressed! I hate to admit it, but Sakura's desperate
to be accepted by you! Like I'd care. Wh-What?! Bastard! Oh, my... There they go. What are you doing? I'm going to hit you
for Sakura's sake. Shadow Clone Jutsu! What's wrong?
Aren't you going to come at me? What?! Shoot! Let go! All right! You fell for it! Take this! You've got the wrong one! Hey, don't you think that was
a little too much? I got hasty. Wait a minute,
how did you get there?! Hey! Get back here! You're annoying too. Damn it... I've got to do something
about Sasuke's quick movements. In that case,
I'll use my trump card! That sign...
Another Shadow Clone Jutsu? Sexy Jutsu! Sasuke! Sasuke is so shocked he's speechless! I've got you! That hurts! Ow ow ow...ow! Hey, Sasuke! We're not finished yet! Naruto! Huh? Sakura... We're meeting in the classroom. Oh... Wait up. They're amusing,
but they lack teamwork. I don't think they can pass my test. We're going to be late, you two. I'll get you for this! Sasuke... Looks like it'll be
my job to stop you. When the fireworks suddenly
explode in the air... fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face... muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly... It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you... kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni Because I always remember you, in situations like this... kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto I can't help but think about the
times we spent together. mata omoidashiteshimau yo I'm ready to forget you... mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu It just tears at my heart too much. konna ni mo kanashikute I wonder... why did we meet each other? doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes... me wo tojireba It's like you are here. ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de That's odd... How far did Inari go?

 Thanks to you,
I'm also caught in this mess.

 Shut up! Will you quit complaining
and help me look?!

 That's why I'm here with you.

 Be grateful, you loser.

 What?! Damn you, Sasuke!

 Hold on... What is this?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Inari's Courage Put to the Test"
 


 Inari! Tune in again!

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,330
This is the place, huh? Gaara is on the other side of this boulder. It looks like they put up a barrier. What's the plan? Let's bust through! No! You're late, Kakashi. Well, you see... we got caught up in something
troublesome along the way. Naruto! Sakura! Kakashi... By troublesome,
you certainly don't mean me, do you? Hey! Naruto... Now, shall we do this, Kakashi? Yeah. FORBIDDEN





 <i>Hang on, Gaara.</i> <i>Charge Tactic!
Button Hook Entry!!


</i> It looks like there's
a large cavern inside, but... But...? I can't really see clearly
what's going on inside... It looks like there are
several people inside... What about Gaara, Neji? What's happening to Gaara?! Wait! I'm searching right now! Neji! Hey! Wh-What's...that...? What is it?
Hey! What's in there, Neji?! Let go of me... What was in there? It's hard to explain in words... Which means... Which means we just have to
check it out directly for ourselves, right? That makes things simple. A barrier, huh...? <i>It's getting noisy outside.</i> <i>It appears they've arrived.</i> Which group? Hm? The group my man Kisame stalled? Or is it... <i>It's...both groups...</i> <i>So they arrived at the same time, huh?</i> <i>However...</i> <i>They were just a bit late...</i> It seems they've got another
Jinchuriki with them... Don't take it personally, Itachi. What's the plan? First, we have to
remove the barrier, Lee. How do we do that? We need to figure out
what kind of barrier it is, right? Yeah. All right. First, we need to find out
what type of barrier this is! Isn't that right, Kakashi! Right. FORBIDDEN What does it look like to you? This is...a Five-Seal Barrier. I agree. A Five-Seal Barrier? A Five-Seal Barrier is created by placing... paper tags with "Forbidden" written
on them in five locations in the area. There's the Forbidden tag
here in front of us... and tags in four other locations... How can we remove them? We can't remove the barrier unless we remove the tags in
all five locations simultaneously. It must be done simultaneously, huh? That's right. The barrier can't be removed unless
the five tags are removed simultaneously. That's how it's been set up. That tag there... And there are four others... FORBIDDEN Then, where are the other four tags?! Neji. I know. Byakugan! I found them! Where are they, Neji?! There's one on a boulder about
500 meters northeast of here... The...second one... is on the trunk of a tree growing
along a riverbank 350 meters to the south-southeast... The third one... is on a cliff about
650 meters to the northwest... The last one... is in a forest a little less than
800 meters to the southwest... Those are the four locations. If so, then they are pretty far away. What will the signal be? No problem there! At that distance... we should be able to use
wireless radios. Wireless radios, huh?! I see. Okay, we'll all stay in communication
and find the tags with Neji's directions! <i>Now then. Shall we get going...?</i> <i>It's starting to get noisy outside</i> <i>and we've got our mission
to complete, after all.</i> <i>Exactly...</i> <i>What shall we do with
the guys outside?</i> <i>Well, we don't even know
if they can get in here...</i> <i>Don't underestimate them.</i> <i>You should know.</i> <i>Well... I acknowledge
their brute strength, at least.</i> <i>Sasori.</i> <i>Deidara.</i> <i>You take care of the guys outside.</i> I knew it would turn out like this... <i>But take the Jinchuriki alive.</i> We know. <i>Everyone else is dismissed.</i> <i>Let's go.</i> <i>Right...</i> <i>We'll be leaving, too...</i> Itachi... What's the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki like? <i>Tell him.</i> <i>He'll be the first one to yell
and scream at you.</i> What does that mean? Doesn't he have any more
specific characteristics? Oh my... <i>Well, that's about it...</i> <i>You okay with that?
Wasn't he your  target?</i> Let's go. Okay. We'll remove the tags in
the four surrounding locations. If this is a competition of speed,
our team will probably be faster, after all. We're counting on you! All right, you head for
the northwest forest, Lee! Yes, Guy Sensei! I leave the northeast boulder to you, Neji. Roger. And you take the south-southeast, Tenten. Understood. I'll head for the northwest cliff. I'm sure that one will be in
the location most difficult to remove. What's the frequency? 174. Roger. <i>Can you hear me guys?</i> Lee! You've got your microphone
turned up too high! Oh! <i>I'm sorry!</i> Lee... Lee...! I'm sorry... My wireless radio settings are okay. Mine are okay as well. All right. Team Guy... R-Right! Okay, okay... With the full power of youth! - Fight!
-Yeah! - Fight!
- Yeah! - Fight! Fight!
- Yeah! Yeah! - And an extra fight!
- Yeah! Scatter! How cool. What cool enthusiasm! Hey guys, let's do that, too...! I'd rather die... Right... You fool...! Well, it's time for me to get going. There's no reason for me to be here
if I'll just be in the way. Good work, Pakkun. Okay, I'm gone... <i>I leave the rest to you.</i> Right... We got it... <i>I'll be waiting to hear from you.</i> Verifying operation. <i>The four members of Team Guy are
to stand by once they find their tags!</i> <i>After all members have
reached their positions...</i> <i>we'll remove the tags
all at once on my signal!</i> <i>Got it?!</i> Yes! <i>Of course, Team Kakashi will remove
their tags simultaneously as well.</i> <i>With this, the Five-Seal Barrier
will be removed.</i> The moment the barrier is removed... Sakura will destroy the boulder
at the entrance. That will be our signal to break inside...
and recover Gaara. <i>Gaara...</i> They're late... I wish they'd just hurry up
and get here... What's wrong, my man Sasori? I thought you didn't like
to be kept waiting. Yeah... I hate it... <i>Sasori...</i> <i>I never thought...
a day like this would come...</i> This is Neji. I'm in position. I've found mine, too!
I'll be arriving soon. I've got mine, too! <i>Neji!</i> I know! Byakugan! A little further south! A little further...
All right, it's right there! Okay! I found it! <i>This is Lee! I'm in position!</i> Kakashi, how's it going there? We're ready when you are. We'll break in using
the Button Hook Entry. Right. I know! Yeah! All right, everyone!
Remove the tags on the count of three! <i>Here we go!</i> <i>One...two...three!</i> Sakura! Right! <i>All right, it looks like it went well...</i> Wh-What's that...?! <i>We're too late...</i> <i>Sasori...</i> Now...which one's the Jinchuriki? You...creeps. I'll kill the both of you! <i>The first one to start yelling
and screaming...</i> <i>It's him, huh?</i> It looks like it. Now then, I'm going to take out
a scroll you can find anywhere. But when I count to three,
a huge Shuriken appears... Hey, don't be taking
someone else's skills! Shut up! I'm practicing for
a talent show. What did you say?! Hey, stop the stupid fighting.
I'll teach you my best skill. Look at these wonderful
midair Kunai Knives! Oh, the Kunai Knives are floating! I'll teach you for just 300 ryo. Uh... I can't do it without
the Puppet Master technique anyway. Next episode:
"Traps Activate! Team Guy's Enemies!" Hey, over here. Don't you think we can still
use this timber? I think you're right. But... There's nothing left of what was built
by generations of Hokage. Who could have imagined
this would happen? This village isn't the only thing
the Hokage left us. You're absolutely right. Yamato... We're all still here! Wood Style! Row Houses Jutsu! At this rate, the Leaf Village
will be rebuilt in no time! Easy for you to say. Is Granny Tsunade still in a coma? Yes. I have so many things
I want to tell her. Don't worry.
Lady Tsunade will wake up soon! She's a strong woman.
Our Hokage! She'll be all right! What am I encouraging Naruto for? I'm the one
who needs convincing...Naruto. It's been a super-long time,
Naruto! Sakura! It's great to see our hero again, Naruto! Is that...? Inari and Old Man Tazuna?! Inari, you've grown up! Old man, you've gotten even older. Shut it... I'm a carpenter now. That's why I've come here,
at the request of the Hidden Leaf. And I thought I'd say hello
to you guys. Sakura, you're so pretty. You think so? Man, how long has it been? Two years? Three? Longer? Imagine, that little kid is now... - Leaf's History -
           Inari's Courage Put to the Test



 I can't find it! It's gone! Cripes. Stop making such a fuss. But it's gone! Teuchi gave me
a free coupon for Ichiraku. I had it on me the whole time. I probably forgot it
at Old Man Tazuna's place. Hey! Hold on! I'll be right back. Jeez... He's so impatient. What a loser. That boy... We need to hurry back after
this drawn-out mission and make our report. Kakashi Sensei, let's just leave him. We can't do that. Sasuke, go and bring him back. Why me? Now now.
This is all part of teamwork. ICHIRAKU RAMEN
FREE COUPON

 ICHIRAKU RAMEN
FREE COUPON

Ichigaku? Never heard of this place. I found this in the room where
those Leaf kids stayed. Huh? I always eat ramen there
after a mission. Always. Really? Is it that good? Of course! I'm not exaggerating
when I say that my blood, body and soul
are made from Ichiraku's ramen. When you come to
my village someday, I'll treat you. This belongs to Naruto. I'll be back! My, my... Watch out! What're you doing, jerk?! That's because you screw up
our teamwork. Huh? Don't waste any more of our time.
Come back now. Okay, I get it. But...after I finish my business! Like I'm going to obey
your orders, stupid! Why you... Look, it's Inari. He's been acting cocky. Ever since he took the spotlight
in that Gato incident. Oww... What's the big idea?! You're cocky. You're supposed to
be crybaby Inari. I'm not a crybaby. Move, I'm in a hurry. Trying to sound tough, huh? As if you can do anything alone. What'll you do? Your ninja friends already
went home to their village. Oh yeah? That's good news. You guys! It was worth the wait. Cripes, you're so persistent! Well then... Hey, wait. It's just for a while. Not! You jerk... You did that for real! Give it up already. What are you two doing here? Old Man Tazuna! Perfect timing! See, I forgot something
at your place. Do you mean a super-tiny piece
of paper? Yeah, yeah. Inari was determined to take it
to you and he ran off a while ago. Huh? How come you're still here?
And the rest of you too. I thought Naruto kicked
you out back then. Kicked us out? We were just waiting until
those troublesome guys left. With them gone,
our land has no more ninja. And no one else to interfere with us. What're you going to do? Calm down, kid.
We're going to be the next Gato. Inari! Hey, where are you?! Strange... I was pretty sure he'd be
on this road. Hey, Sasuke! Help me look too! Inari went looking for you. I have nothing to do with this. What?! Hey, whatever happened to teamwork?! That's why I'm here with you. Be grateful, you loser. Hey, where are you going? Shut up! I need to take a leak! What's my ramen coupon doing here? Hey, look. What's this? It's slight...but I detect signs of a fight. Did something happen? Inari... How about ransoming the kids
to make money? In any case, turning into
the next Gato is a great plan. Alcohol and money...
We'll take it all. Man, I feel like cutting
into something. Like that kid back there. Cut it out.
That's a bad habit of yours. I wonder what's going to happen to us. We finally got rid of Gato.
And now... Crying won't help. Crying won't solve anything.
Naruto taught me that. Inari? We fight. Otherwise, we can't protect
the things that are dear to us. This is bad. This rain... It's only a matter of time before
all traces are washed away. Then we've got to find another way
before that happens! Please be safe. Everyone ready to go? Yeah. We've got to run back to town
and notify the grown-ups. - Yeah!
- Yeah! Oh no! What? The kids' room! Hey! The brats are running away! These marks are fresh. From a sword? I've...seen this before! So the culprits are Gato's remnants? Up ahead... Let's go, Naruto! Gotcha! Find them. They must be close. Those brats made fools of us. Hey, at this rate, we'll be found. I'll distract them. D-Don't be ridiculous! If you try that, they'll... Otherwise, we'll all be killed. Besides...I have an idea. Cripes, where'd they go? Found them! Over this way. Inari... Let's go, you two. It's do or die.
Please protect me...Dad! Inari is late. I wonder where he's gone. You're right. What is it? The kids who went out to play
haven't returned yet. Akane's not back yet. Neither is my son. Yamabuki hasn't returned either,
it seems. They were seen earlier today
with your Inari. You're a bundle of trouble! We can't have you running off again. Maybe we should just
cut off a leg, eh? Ready to give up? What? He jumped?! Below! Go down there! Dad, you swam through
those rapids to fix the dam, right? I guess I did, among other things. You're amazing, Dad. I can't even swim. Then that's one of the things
you must do your best to learn. But...I'm scared. Don't worry. You have those two arms.
You can do anything. Just move those arms!
Paddle hard. I can't, Dad.
The water's so cold. This way. Hang in there. But I'm not moving forward at all. Why can't... Wait! Please wait! It's all right. You can do it! Come on, Inari! Inari! Inari! Grab on! All right! How come you guys are here? Good job, Inari!
You helped your friends escape. That's what led us here. Akane and the others? Looks like we don't have time
to chat. You're the brats from
the Hidden Leaf. You've got some nerve,
showing up here! It's just two kids. Get 'em! - Yeah!
- Yeah! Naruto! Yeah! We won't be outnumbered! Let's go, everyone! - Yeah!
- Yeah! You stay here. Okay! You guys... So weak, so weak! You're nothing against me! As long as I'm not taken
by surprise, this is easy. Demon Wind Shuriken! What?! Why you... I'll pulverize you! No, don't! Such simpletons. Underestimating us...
I'll kill you! You're no match at all. Here we go! Damn! They may be kids,
but they're still ninja! This isn't going to work. We'll be back.
First, let's regroup! What?! As if we'll welcome you back! This is the end of the road for you. Grandpa! Everyone! We'll never allow thugs to
have their way in our land! Remnants of Gato's group
were up to no good, eh? We'll turn you in to the authorities
so you can never do evil again. And I thought you were just
a bunch of cowards. Thanks, Inari. Akane... I misjudged you. Not "heh heh heh"! Oww! Cripes, you made us worry! You are such a... Naruto... I... I'm sorry! He's crying. It's okay...at times like this. Oh yeah,
I forgot to give you something. Don't worry. I have that coupon... It's gone. You probably dropped it in the river. Forget it already. Akane and the others too. They're carpenters like me. See? They're working over there. What a surprise. Back then, and that time with Gato. Thank you for everything. Because of you, the Land of Waves
has become very prosperous. So this time,
we're going to return the favor! And first, Naruto...will be Ichiraku!
Just you watch. I'll build an amazing one! Inari... Thanks. What's with that pathetic stance?

 He can try a hundred years,

 and he still won't get his revenge
if he's like that!

 Huh? Hey, where do you think
you're going, Naruto?!

 I'm going to help train
that man from scratch!

 He's gone...

 Are you just going to let him
go like that, Kakashi Sensei?

 That's fine. There's not much to do
until tomorrow's departure anyway.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's School of Revenge"



 All right!
Let's start our lesson!



 Tune in again!

 - Leaf's History -  
Naruto's School of Revenge  


 Cripes. So I'm great, huh? It's hard to take your compliments
seriously, Old Man Tazuna. Oh, come on. You've really grown up to
become a fine young man. You really think so? Amazingly so. You're such a sucker for compliments! I'm dead serious. He's right!
Naruto is the hero of our land! Did you hear that, Sakura? Maybe you are now, but... Huh? What? Back then, you got caught up
in all sorts of mischief. It was fun, wasn't it?
Team 7. You're right.
Yeah, it sure was fun. Hey, remember that man?
The one out for revenge. Oh yeah, Tsukado!
That brings back memories. That was also when you got carried away
and caused us trouble. Today you shall meet your doom! Katazu, the man who killed
someone in my family! Now fight me! Seriously, those eyes. They look like they want
to devour me. Oh, come on!
I think it's kind of cute. Anyway, you got the luck of the draw.
So you have to take care of it. Don't worry.
You two make quite a pair. I don't know how you can say that! Ow! Hey, cut it out!
Ow ow ow! A stray cat, a stray dog, a stray pig... And now, a stray ostrich? We may be going up in scale, but I don't see how these silly missions
will improve our skills. Missions, eh? The purpose for this isn't to improve skill. You're not undergoing training. Although I understand
why you're impatient. In that case, use this ostrich
to improve your skills! Hey, what're you doing?! - Shut up and improve your skills!
- That's your responsibility! I'm letting you have it! Oww! Oww! Oww! Oww! WELCOME We'll find an inn for the night.
Mr. Ostrich looks worn out too. Jeez... If it were just us, we'd be able to make it back
to the village by nightfall. Huh? What's that?! I'm gonna take a look! Naruto! Not again! Oww! Let's go. What could it be? Not you too! Huh? A fight? No, it seems to be a vendetta. A vendetta? You mean like when
someone fights for revenge? Revenge... Revenge...on a busy street
in the middle of the day? Is that okay, Kakashi Sensei? VENDETTA PERMIT

A vendetta permit, huh? Depending on the land,
if someone is murdered, the family members are given
permission to seek revenge. As long as he has
an authorized permit from that land, other nations will allow the vendetta. I heard that man Tsukado
had a distant relative. And the killer over there called
the relative out late at night. Then he ruthlessly hit him from
behind with a rock, and killed him. Awful story, huh? The killer escaped and
the family wanted revenge. And that man was chosen for the task. What a villain. Boss Kanabun, it looks like a vendetta. Now this is interesting.
Who do you think will win, boys? Well... They say the hunter is
usually stronger than the hunted. Nah, I'm not with you there. The hunted one has a pretty mean look. He's going for it! No! Whoa... Huh?! Hmm... Looks like he won't be
getting his revenge. What?! Hey! Hold it!
Hey! You bastard! Damn you... Here! Oh, thanks. I almost had him. It didn't look that way. Amateurs can keep their opinions
to themselves. I may not look it,
but I am a veteran of 34 vendettas. Oh... What?!
You mean you've failed 34 times?! Next time, for sure! I think not! I must complete my vendetta! I must avenge old Shikazo of my clan! For the cowardly and
tricky way he was killed. If I don't avenge him, I... I... Mister... Your words are too cruel. There is no way to know
that unless I try. Next time, on my 35th attempt, I may just successfully complete
my vendetta. Isn't that so? All right, I understand! Huh? I'll help you! I'll mobilize every ninja skill there is
and help you become a vendetta pro. Huh? Stupid Naruto!
Getting carried away like that! Well, let's leave Naruto to handle this. We'll take a break at the inn. Ridiculous. Mister, leave it to me! Lesson One! You don't have enough anger
towards your enemy! You have to be able to explode
with anger at any moment. Then you'll never be caught
off guard for a vendetta! Right... Hey, you there! Watch it, old lady! Cripes!
Hurry up and get on my back! Huh? So where're you headed?
Cripes! Huh? The next town? Cripes, that's close! - I don't care if it's far. Cripes.
- Um... That's not what I meant. Lesson Two! Take all vendettas seriously,
even the easy ones. Get used to taking revenge! Uh-huh. Hey... I shall assist! Huh? This one's for the shoulder! - The shoulder! The shoulder!
- S-Stop it! - The shoulder! The shoulder!
- That's not what I meant either. Lesson Three! Fill your mind with images of
your enemy until it's ready to burst, then manifest your anger on paper. Uh-huh... How... How come your hated enemy
looks so nice? You know, I don't think
you're cut out for vendettas. And you're not cut out to be a coach. Do you have to carry out the vendetta? Yeah. I can't return home unless I do. I want to finish this and go home.
To my aging mother and father. An ostrich is running wild! M-Mister? That guy... Was he hiding his skills? Boys! Right! Sorry. The ostrich bit through
his rope leash. As I had suspected,
you are a master swordsman. Huh? What's going on? If you're that strong, how come
you can't finish your vendetta? I don't know. It's just that, when I look into his eyes
the strength drains out of me. It's those eyes.
It's those eyes that... Mister... I wonder what happened to that man. He probably set out in pursuit
of his enemy. Will he be doing that
the rest of his life? What's going on?! How's that, Mr. Vendetta? Your tenacity won me over. I want you to get your revenge,
so I brought your enemy to you. Now, let's see you pay him back
to your heart's content. Mister... Whoa! However, we of the Kanabun Gang
will oversee this vendetta. All right, one and all! Who's gonna win this vendetta?! Place your bets now! Who's the stronger one? It's gotta be the one taking revenge! He looks so hopeless.
No way he'll win! I bet 500 ryo on his foe! Me too! If you're short on cash, the Kanabun Gang will place
a bet for you! If that guy uses his real strength,
this fight... Yeah. We'll make a tidy profit. That's terrible.
Making a buck off of his vendetta. It all ends here. Well... I can't die yet. On guard. What?! He's going to fight without looking
his opponent in the eye! He just might win! Don't tell me Naruto's lessons helped. I...I don't like this fight. I wonder why... It's him. Just like Mister said. That guy's face... His eyes... Those eyes again! How can you be like that?! You could be killed by me, so why?! Why doesn't that guy
try to kill Tsukado? Well then... Wait! The reason why
you couldn't kill this guy... Deep down, you know why, don't you? Yeah... I realized it just now. I see... The blade has been dulled. This man can't kill anyone. I have a twin brother named Kageki. A twin...brother? Kageki had loaned money to Shikazo,
a member of your family. But then, my brother had
a child and he needed money. So he went back to ask to be repaid. Shikazo ignored my brother
and tried to go back on his loan. A scuffle broke out and
they both fell to the dirt floor. At that moment, Shikazo hit his head
on a pickling stone and died. Are you saying it was an accident? Kageki said he was going
to turn himself in. But there were no witnesses. Considering the circumstances, he'd probably have been
accused of murder. So I offered to switch places with him. What? I took his identity and sent him and his wife,
who had just given birth, into hiding. In order to buy them time, I purposely attracted
the attention of his pursuers. I couldn't let a great guy
like him ruin his life. Whereas I've been a scoundrel who's caused nothing
but grief to my family and to society. I figured it was a way to
make amends. I only have my kid brother's word for it. There's no way to prove it,
but I trust him. Mister... It's up to you whether
you believe me or not. If you don't... Then kill me. Well then, I'm going to believe you. - You...
- Mister! Actually, I'm sick and tired of
this thing called revenge. If you've pretended all these years
to be my foe... Well, starting now,
I'll just pretend that I'm on a vendetta. That won't do! You're going to fight,
no matter what it takes! Otherwise, we'll hurt you real bad! I'll assist. We will too! Allow us to assist! I have no choice. I want to get back to the village quickly
and resume training. So count me in. Get them! Oww! Oww! Oww! You'll be sorry! The way this ended...
It was okay, right, Kakashi Sensei? Well... That's for those two to decide. Revenge is a hard thing, isn't it? What would you know? Huh? Sometimes, a vendetta must be carried out,
no matter how hard it is. Back then, we...
I mean, I was such a kid. Sasuke... Huh? You're already here? Kakashi! Oh, Kakashi! We rushed over after hearing
the Hidden Leaf Village was in a crisis! I see. Huh? What is it? Where is Sasuke? I want to talk to him too. Oh... Well, actually... Sasuke is...you see... Sasuke and I had a small fight and
he's out of the village right now. Don't worry,
I'll go bring him back right away! When I do, please say hello to him. I know Sasuke would be happy. Right, Sakura? U-Uh-huh. Don't tell me...
It's over some love triangle, eh? No, that's not it! Thank you, Naruto. Sasuke... Where are you right now? You have no siblings, or parents! How can you understand
anything about me?! You've been alone from the start! What can you understand
about me?! Having a bond is what
makes it painful! And how could you know what it feels
like to lose that bond?! Now I can understand...how Sasuke felt. About what revenge is. Have you come to understand
a little of what pain is? Unless you know the same pain,
you cannot truly know another. I thought I knew Sasuke. But I didn't understand him at all. No matter what I said to him back
in the Final Valley, it wouldn't have reached Sasuke. Naruto... I didn't know Sasuke's pain,
so how could I laugh with him? Why should he give me
the time of day, let alone fight with me? It'll probably hurt like hell, but next time, I want to have
a serious fight with him. Because some day, I want Team 7 to all be laughing
together again with Sasuke back with us! This should be our rendezvous point.

 Looks like we got here first.

 Cripes, it's hard to tell if the Hidden Sand
really wants to make up

 with the Hidden Leaf when they're
running late for our joint mission.

 Sorry we're late.

 You're...

 Of all the people...

 He's the one we're doing
the joint mission with?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 "Gaara's Bond"    



 We're allied nations,
so let's try and get along, okay?



 Tune in again!

 This is quite a challenge. All the more reason why it'll become
a good puppet once I fully master it. I wondered why
you were cooped up in here. New puppets? Yeah... It's a bit complicated
to assemble. And I wasn't cooped up! Getting ready for war? Sort of... You heard what happened
to the Leaf Village. At this point,
nothing would surprise me. The Leaf Village belongs
to our alliance. We can't shrug it off as
someone else's problem. Nope. And rebuilding a village
that's been destroyed is no easy task. Above all, they must fill the void
created by an absent Hokage. You're right. From a political and
psychological standpoint, being without their Hokage,
their leader and pillar, has got to hurt badly. Damn, I screwed up. Do you think they can
overcome the damage the Akatsuki caused without
a Hokage, Gaara? I don't know. But...that village has him. I don't want to say this... But you're nothing
but a frightening weapon to the village. It'll just be a struggle for you to join a regular unit at this point. The superiors don't think
well of you. And a majority of the village
is scared of you. - But...
- I know that. But I will be overcome with
an even greater suffering if I just wait around. I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself. And I must not run away
from my path of solitude. If I do that, then someday... I can be like him. Huh?! A joint mission with the Hidden Sand?! We can handle this without them! Now don't say that. There's trouble at the borderline
we share with the Sand Village. If a request went to one side,
the other side might be offended, right? So wouldn't it be better if
the two allies cooperated and worked together
on this mission? Besides, that makes it easier. This alliance was formed right
after the attack on the Leaf Village. So there's bound to be problems
at the start. The first step is to build trust
in our relationship, and that's what this mission is. Wow, Sasuke! You are amazingly sharp! It takes all the fun out if
you explain it so bluntly. What? What?
What do you mean? It's too deep for you to
ever understand! This is about nations
and villages and important people. Come on Sakura...
You don't have to sound so mean. Anyway, it's a joint mission. So let's do our best to
get along with them. Okay, enough talking. Let's head to the rendezvous point
with the Sand. All right! Let's race to see
who gets there first! Hey Naruto! No fair! I'm the first! You're so immature! Jeez... This should be our rendezvous point. Maybe we got here too early. They're late? What jerks! Those guys in the Sand Village... You can never tell
what they're thinking. They're sorta scary. If they expect to be friends
with the Leaf Village, they should be more prompt! Sorry we're late. Ga...Ga... Gaara?! Of all people... He's the one we're doing
the joint mission with? Oh... Don't worry, Gaara.
You're right on time. We got here a little early, that's all. No... P-Pardon me! I'm sorry! We were a little late.
My apologies. He's lost much of that bloodthirsty look
and gotten mellower. The Sand's... Ultimate Defense! Ow ow ow! Hey, what's the big idea, Naruto?! Oww... Just a way of greeting him. Throwing rocks can't hurt
No Brows anyway, right? Huh? Where are the other two? H-He made Lord Gaara use
his Ultimate Defense. How scary is that?! I guess he can't get accepted
that easily. Cripes, what's with them?
They're such wimps. Say, why aren't make-up dude
and fan lady with you? Oww! You mean, Kankuro and Temari. I'm currently enlisted under
the regular forces. Let me introduce you to
my subordinates, Yaoki and Korobi. I'm Yaoki! I'm Korobi! I'm Hatake Kakashi,
the one in charge of this mission. And this is Naruto, Sakura,
and Sasuke. What's up! Nice to meet you. Oh, hello! Pleased to meet you! They're still rookies.
Please be patient with them. Now that we've joined up, Gaara's team will approach from
the western side of the mountain. My Team 7 will approach
from the east. And we'll simultaneously attack
the bandits who are based at the summit. The assault will commence at midnight. Does that sound okay? There's no need to wait that long. We can take out those bandits
by ourselves! The bandits are made up
of rogue ninja. Word has it that chunin-class ninja
are among them. He's right, Naruto! You might end up
putting us all in danger! Fine, I got it. We'll go with your strategy. There's something
I need to discuss with you. Why's Gaara acting all secretive? The two captains probably want
to go over details. Captain? He's so full of himself! Someone tracking you? Yes... Hopefully there's no interference. But I thought you should know. You seem to have someone in mind. The higher-ups of my village hate me. I may cause you trouble, but... That's fine with me. This mission will
only be meaningful if the Leaf and Sand Villages
complete this mission and tighten our bonds. The more problems we face together,
the stronger our bond will become. All right. Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke! We're leaving now! Yes! Don't be late this time, Gaara! We're leaving too. Can you believe he volunteered
for the regular forces? It makes our mission
that much easier. The higher-ups will be very pleased. And our reputation will grow as well. Gaara of the Sand! We're taking your head! - Leaf's History -
                                 Gaara's Bond



 I had heard rumors that
Lord Gaara had changed. However... The Ultimate Defense...of the Sand... It's a fact that countless ninja
have become victims of his wrath. I hope nothing goes wrong. A foe?! Is it the bandits?! No... Their target...is me. The superiors don't think well of you. And a majority of the village
is scared of you. I've decided to move forward. I can't afford to be stuck
here like this! What's wrong, Kakashi Sensei? How long do you intend to tail us? Show yourself! Huh? What? No wonder they call you
Kakashi of the Sharingan eye. I thought I had hid my presence. Please continue on your way. We have no intention of interfering
with the missions of allied nations. An ally nation? Do you belong to the Sand Village? Please think of us as...auditors. Auditors? As in inspectors. They're probably here to observe
the outcome of this mission from behind the scene. And they need to wear masks
for that? I don't trust them. Actually... They don't trust Gaara.
Isn't that it? To the Sand Village,
Lord Gaara's power... Rather, because
we are the Sand Village, Lord Gaara's power poses
a serious threat to us. You have also seen
Lord Gaara's jutsu. Don't you agree that it is
a power that shouldn't exist? They're even thinking of
eliminating Gaara. So an assassination squad
has been dispatched. It's not a bad proposition for
the Leaf Village either. After all, your neighboring village will
have one less powerful weapon. How cruel.
He's a ninja from your village. You understand, don't you? Lord Gaara is a serious threat
to both our villages and cannot continue to exist! I am a dangerous tool to the village. I'm a past relic that they
would prefer to see disappear. Back then, that's what
I thought about myself. Rather, I couldn't help but believe it. And... that was the harshest thing to bear. The thought that my existence
didn't matter to the world. Then why do I exist?
What's the point of me living? Lord Gaara cannot continue to exist... Don't let them go! Surely there are those who
are sympathetic towards Gaara among the Sand Village. You people were not able
to accept Gaara. And I can understand your point. But don't jump to the conclusion
that we feel the same way. He fell for it! - Huh?!
- Huh?! Wh-What's going on?! Why are the puppets...?! Lord Gaara! We'll be killed! That's right! That guy is a killing machine
who thinks nothing of human lives! He's a monster who enjoys killing! L-Lord Gaara... Who would've thought
he would fall for our trap so easily? This makes our mission much easier. Puppet Water Style:
Mystic Rain Dance Jutsu! D-Did we get away? Run? From what? Huh? Back there, didn't Lord Gaara... Did he tell us to get away? Are you all right?! Where's Gaara? You guys, did you abandon
your friend?! Friend... You and me... and Lord Gaara? The rain your sand absorbed
is molded with our chakra. It had dampened your sand,
making it less cohesive. Your jutsu is sealed. Die! What?! Gaara! We've come to rescue you! Naruto...Uzumaki! That's just a Shadow Clone. Don't get nervous! Only one of them is real! He's not alone! We're not gonna run anymore! Lord Gaara is our friend! Lord Gaara!
We're sorry we ran off without you! We're going to fight too! Alongside you, Lord Gaara! Those two... Damn small fries. The higher-ups have taken
my power lightly. It'll take more than this to kill me. This is more than enough
for you guys. Show off. What an unfortunate incident. The ones we encountered
have been restrained. I've caused you trouble. Forgive me. These are the ones
who caused trouble. Don't! I know perfectly well what they're like. But...still... they are my people
from the Sand Village. I see. Well then...
Shall we get back to our mission? This is where it all starts for me. Starting with this small bond. I, too, want to become
someone who is needed. Instead of a weapon that is feared. And as the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village. You realized your dream. To forge a bond with
your people in the village and be accepted by them,
and to become the Kazekage. He was the one who taught me
to deepen my bond with my people. Thanks to him,
I was able to regain my true self. That village has him. The one who cherishes a friend's bond
more than anyone I know. Naruto Uzumaki... Knowing him and the friends
he holds so dear they'll overcome this disaster and
grow even stronger from it. Tell me again. Tell me what
you said back then...once more. We're sorry we ran off without you. Not that! No. What you said before that. - Oh!
- Huh? - We're your friends!
- We're your friends! What is the meaning of this?

 After all this time,
you still haven't captured Naruto?!

 I'm sorry, Lady Tsunade!

 He's more troublesome
than we had expected.

 The Medical Unit is not enough
to contain him!

 If we're to consider
the danger he poses,

 we must take whatever
means necessary!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto: Outbreak"


 You won't escape this time, Naruto!


 Tune in again!

 Don't worry. Lady Tsunade
will return for sure. Yes... Hey! I brought you lunch. Here you go. Here's your ration of rice balls. There are only two of us.
We don't need so much. Then can I take half of them? That was your plan
from the start, wasn't it?! You got me there. You should have some too, Sakura. Rice balls taste best with salt. All right then. Guess I'll go help rebuild Ichiraku in exchange for
a bowl of ramen. You really love ramen, don't you? I need ramen to keep up
my strength. Naruto is always so energetic. No kidding. Well, you know the saying,
"Fools never catch a cold." Fools never catch a cold, huh? What are you doing,
you idiot?! This is what I get for coming
all this way to pick you up?! It'll be fine if you let it dry. It's not fine! I'm about to
leave on a mission! I hate you, Naruto! S-Sakura... ICHIRAKU I can't help
but drown myself in food. That's fine,
but this is overdoing it. I feel sick. Are you all right? Want us to call the doctor? They can give you an injection
for overeating. Injection?! No, no, no, no! My belly is so heavy.
I can't even take off my shoes. Oww... I have a bellyache. Oh, Sakura... Wh-Wh-What is this? Target confirmed. What's going on? Seize target. An injection?! That was close. Who the heck are you guys?! Another shot?! Don't let him get away! Target found! It doesn't matter how,
just stop the target! What's going on?! He got away. Capture Naruto immediately. Sakura Haruno,
permission to enter. As you know, the village is
very short-handed right now. Simple missions must be done solo. Right. Sakura... Is something wrong? No...it's nothing. What's wrong?! Don't go near her! Sakura, did someone sneeze on you? N-Naruto...did... Oh, no! -Leaf's History-
Naruto: Outbreak


 We gave Sakura
a sedative to sleep. And? How is she? I won't get the results of
the blood tests until tomorrow. But her symptoms are stomach pain, fever and a rash on her face. As I expected.
They're all signs of the chakra virus. Chakra virus? It's an extremely
contagious mystery virus. It's a nasty thing that turns
chakra into a fever. Turns chakra into a fever?! Yes. Once infected,
you won't be able to mold chakra until you've recovered for
at least several months. To a ninja, it's a deadly disease. But how did Naruto get infected
with this chakra virus? There was an outbreak once
in a certain village. The virus was contained immediately and it was thought to be destroyed. You mean, the place where Naruto
was sent on his mission... It was that village. I think we can conclude that
Naruto is the source of the virus. In our current state,
if the virus spreads, inevitably, Hidden Leaf Village will
become even more vulnerable. And if we come under attack,
we will be destroyed. Hence, we must deal with this
under utmost secrecy. Other nations, of course, but even our own people
must not find out. Do not waste a minute
in finding Naruto and isolating him! He can't have gone too far. Those guys...
Who the heck were they? What were they doing with
an injection weapon? Wait, could it be? Want us to call the doctor? They can give you an injection
for overeating. Was it Old Man Teuchi's doing?! ICHIRAKU Old man! Wake up! What? Who is it at this hour? I'm coming, I'm coming. Don't tell me you haven't
had enough ramen? Or did you come to pay your tab? It's you, isn't it?! You told them to give me a shot! Huh? What're you talking about? You told the doctor to
give me a shot, right?! Why would I do that? Is that what you're fussing about? Target found! Wh-Who are these guys?! That's what I'd like to know! Capture the target. Whoa, watch it! What're you doing?! Old man?! Never mind! Get the targ- What are you doing?
After him! Find him, no matter what! This is crazy. They're making way too much
out of overeating ramen. Well? Did you find him? No, sir! He's not here! What's going on anyway? An enemy attack? If that's the case,
no way am I gonna be captured. Are you saying they can't
even capture Naruto?! I'm very sorry. Naruto is a handful for
the Medical Team alone. I guess there's no time to be
choosy about the method. It's morning?! I must've dozed off. Everybody's gone. Sakura... Sakura! Even Sakura's gone. What is this? Wh-What is all this?! Damn... Target lost. Damn it!
Where are they shooting from? Target located. Firing. A Shadow Clone?! Now you're gonna spill it all. What nation are you from?! Stop! The Hidden Leaf crest? Why are people from
my village after me? W-Well... The Fifth Hokage ordered it. Granny Tsunade?! But why? I don't have the details. Our orders are to capture
Naruto Uzumaki. But what about the rest
of the villagers? They have all been evacuated
to a safe location. Evacuated? There's no need to worry.
This is just an emergency drill. It will be over by sundown,
so please be patient. In any case,
tell me everything you know! All right! Shizune! Submit quietly, Naruto. I won't let you get away. I guess I'll just have to
confront Granny Tsunade. Naruto! Come to me! But you won't be able to
run away anymore! Wh-What's that?! I'm not going to run or hide. Multi Shadow Clones...
I see you used your head, Naruto. However... I've already anticipated
your actions! This wall is nothing! There's a trap at the top of the wall. - Whoa! That way!
- This way! That way! What's going on?! This is the Hidden Leaf's
Eight Trigram Trap Formation. No matter how massive the force, before this formation,
they are totally at our mercy. Damn it! This is a dead-end too! Choji?! I'm in trouble! Help me out! Naruto... I don't know what you've done,
but orders are orders. Huh? Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! Wait, Choji! Hear me out! Stop! Stop! Roll out! Huh? Looks like the real Naruto
wasn't in there. This side has Tenten?! Sorry, but I'm putting you to sleep. Will you please listen to
my side of the story? Sweet dreams! Umm... Only Shadow Clones on my side too. Now it's Kiba?! Akamaru, let's put an end to this. Beast Mimicry Ninja Art! Why is everyone after me?! Fang Over Fang! Stop! Only Shadow Clones here too. The only side left is north. Huh? What? No! HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL That was a close call. You should realize that it's too soon
to let down your guard. That's because one never knows
where one's foe may be lurking. That annoying way of talking... Shino! You're the one who's open! An Insect Clone?! As I said... One never knows where
one's foe may be lurking. Stay still. It'll be less painful that way. So he still had Shadow Clones? He's laying low somewhere.
Find him. Jeez... That was close. What're you doing there? Sasuke?! Is that you, Sasuke? Naruto... Thank goodness! I didn't do a thing,
yet they're after me. I was wondering why
it was so noisy this morning. It was hell, I tell you. Huh? Why? Don't take this personally. This is so mean. G-Granny Tsunade... Leave it to you to give us
such a hard time, Naruto! Seize him! Target captured! What?! He's not infected by the virus?! Neither Naruto nor Sakura had
evidence of the virus in their blood. Then what about Naruto's sneezing? Well, we found a vial of pepper
in his pocket. We believe this is the cause. Then what about Sakura collapsing? Plain fatigue, it seems. And the redness of her face?
How do you explain that? It was an allergic reaction
to Naruto's sneezing. In other words,
it was never the chakra virus? Yes, that is the case. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Well, I won't be satisfied until I get a personal apology
from Granny Tsunade. Naruto... She may be the Hokage, but that doesn't excuse her
from owning up to her mistake. It wasn't a mistake. This was an emergency drill. EMERGENCY DRILL

This was an emergency drill. EMERGENCY DRILL

And I'm grateful for your cooperation. Wh-What did you say?! All's well that ends well. It didn't go well at all! Hey, hey, hey,
Choji, passing through. Honestly... Fools never catch a cold, but... Oww! Oh, sorry. Watch where you walk, will you? Ow! He knows how to stir things up. I'm the team leader for this mission!

 I don't know...
I still think Neji should be the leader.

 Silence!

 I'm the chosen leader for today's mission!

 Calm down, Tenten.
It's only a D-rank mission.

 Don't worry. I'm going to do this!

 I'll make sure this mission
is a success!

 All right men, let's go!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Deploy! Team Tenten"

 I think you've got it
all wrong. Tune in again!

 We finally made it. It's been over two years
since we last came here. Do you think he'll comply
with our request willingly? I'm sure he'll help us if we tell him it's for the sake of restoring
the Leaf Village. I hope you're right. Ninjutsu is all about challenge! It seems he hasn't changed a bit. As you know, the village is facing
a personnel shortage now. So teams dispatched
on D-rank missions will be made up of genin only. But Guy Sensei... With Lee in the hospital,
we can only form two-man cells. And that's where we shuffle! We're going to fiddle around a bit with our current team formation. Now come on out, new face! A new face? Who is it? Naruto? I'm not sure what's going on,
but I'm the new face. What? He's the new face? I was anticipating someone really cool. Me too. Well, sorry to disappoint you! With Naruto added to
the three-man cell, you will now be assigned
a D-rank mission. I see. I'm taking Bushy Brow's place. Lee will be fine! I'll keep checking
on him at the hospital. So rest assured, young one! Oww! So what's our mission? The details are in here. You'll be the team captain
for this mission, Tenten. Huh? What?! Ordinarily, Neji would be
the captain, but Tenten is the ideal one
for this mission. Me? Well, I must get going.
Good luck, all of you! Huh?! Guy Sensei! He's just going to leave us?! So? What's next, Captain? Oh, that's right.
I'm the team captain. Maybe Neji should take over,
after all. Be quiet, newcomer! I'm the captain - for today's mission!
- I-I can't breathe. I'm going to do this! I'll make sure this mission
is a success! Calm down.
It's only a D-rank mission! All right then! Let's go! Right! I think you've got this all wrong. - Leaf's History -
Deploy! Team Tenten


 We're here. That's the hut? Yup. The Leaf Ninja Tool Research Lab. Originally, this research lab was
situated inside the Leaf Village. Our mission is to procure
1000 kunai knives, 1000 shuriken, and if available, new ninja tools. Why so many?! The three of us can't
possibly haul them all! No wonder Tenten's the ideal captain
for this mission. Huh? Tenten's scroll uses
the Transportation Technique which allows her to store
and summon various ninja tools when needed. T-Transportation Technique? You're familiar with
the Summoning Jutsu, right? Yeah. It's the ninja tool version of that. Which means we don't need
to carry anything on the way back! Exactly. New ninja tools... What's up, Captain? I wonder what these
new ninja tools are like. Ninjutsu is all about challenge! Let's go! Wait up! Hey! What about the new ninja tools?! I wonder what went wrong? Are you Sir Iou? I'm Iou. Who are you? We're here on village business! Oh, welcome. Umm... The fire! H-Hey... - Do you have new ninja tools?
- Hot, hot, hot, hot! New ninja tools, you say? Yes! Don't the other tools come first? Never mind!
This is a captain's decision! Shoseki, bring that to me. Yes, sir. Here they are. First, this! Double-Bladed Kunai! Double-Blade Kunai? It is double bladed to
make it deadlier. Oww! Oh, by the way, the blade is coated with poison,
so be careful. Too late. This is too risky for the wielder. Precisely! And so, I made this! The Double-Handed Kunai! That serves no purpose. What?! Then how about this?! Thousand-Bladed Shuriken! For starters, you can't hold it! Instead of a Chain-Sickle,
it's the Sickle-Chain! Not what I'd expected. There's nothing we can use. What?! Do you have any other ninja tools? Well, if these little pieces
don't interest you, I have something big! Something big?! Please show us! Now this is what I call
a Ninja Shuriken! Why me?! Neji, switch with me! And this is? It's a shuriken that can steer left to right
with the ninja as its pilot. You just turn this lever
to the left or right. Fire! Naruto! The lever! Pull the lever! Huh?! What?! Is there anything else? Right now, that's about it. Old man! You were kicked out
of the village because of your explosions
and failures. Isn't that so?! Don't say failures.
These are challenges. You don't deny it? We've seen enough of the new tools. Please supply the village with 1000 regular kunai knives
and 1000 regular shuriken. I don't want to give regular ones. Get them ready please! A-All right. How boring, right Shoseki? Yes, so boring, Sensei. Please get those
regular ones ready, okay? Oh, what a disappointment. What's disappointing, Captain? Well, I was looking forward
to the new ninja tools. Like those? Three members of Team Guy specialize
in close-contact battles, so I often render aid from a distance. Oh? I don't mind providing back-up, but I was hoping to find
new ninja tools that would enable me to
fight on the front lines. Don't even think about that.
Just step up and fight! You're so simple, aren't you? Huh? I am? Yeah. But I guess you're right. Hey. Neji... The fish is ready to eat. Oh... Then I'll go call Sir Iou
and Shoseki. No way! They ran away. What?! Those guys are useless. What now, Captain? Are we heading back to the Village? Wait. It's true that their inventions
are useless. But their passion for
their invention is genuine! Is that so? I don't think Sir Iou would abandon
this research lab. Neji, can you search the area? Yes. Byakugan! That's... You found it! What is this place? They seem to be up ahead. This trap is so obvious! I'll destroy it! Wait! Whoa. What's the deal, Captain?! That. Which means... That one. What?! Rotation! That was a close call. Neji, I'll take over. Thanks. Now! You did it! Not yet! Here they come! You hit them all. Let's go. This is... Wow! Amazing... The brilliance of the blade...
the design. They're all beautiful! I want to take them all home! All right! Neji, Naruto! Bring each one here!
I wonder if they'll all fit in? I-It's heavy. What's going on? It won't budge. Hey... Do not try to take my masterpieces
without permission! Please share these ninja tools
with our village! No way! Huh? Why not?! The user is essential when
it comes to honed weapons. I do not want my ninja tools
handled carelessly. Still, I'm impressed that
you bypassed those traps I set. I've trained with many kinds
of ninja tools. That was nothing. Hmm... Then let me test your skill once more. There's a ninja tool
I just developed. What is it? Here... Now this is my finest masterpiece. Jidanda! Jidanda?! What was that? Oops, I did it. I stepped on a stupid trap. Like it had an affect on you, Gameru. Who are you two?! Oh, we just came to get some
of your ninja tools. I belong to the Leaf. There's nothing for you here! The Leaf is in chaos right now. Thanks to that, we were able
to easily slip past the border. Sir Iou! Hey, you were right, Kusune. A three-man cell made up of kids. The Leaf must really be
short of personnel. Neji, take the left. Naruto, the right. I'll provide back-up while guarding Sir Iou. Right. - Scatter!
- Scatter! Let's go, Kusune! Right! - What's that?!
- It's nothing! Damn! What? That's impossible. Those are my prototype ninja tools, Dako and Tsuru-Kame. Why do they have it? Forgive me! What's wrong, Shoseki? Funding from the village was
not enough to sustain the research, so I sold a few of the ninja tools
without your knowledge. You sold them?! The men were just collectors
of ninja tools, and you told me both
were only prototypes. All weapons are ultimately
used in battle! And even if they were just prototypes,
they were my inventions! Take that! What?! Naruto! Dako is a cross-shaped spear that can stretch, contract,
and bend! Neji! Tsuru-Kame has a built-in
firing mechanism for ninja tools. Did I get him? What?! Leave him to me! Eat this! What are its weaknesses? There's no such thing. I thought they were prototypes? I referred to them as prototypes
only because I used its data and developed an even more
powerful ninja tool. Then please let me have that one! That is...Jidanda! They seem to be good at close combat,
so just keep your distance. Don't get too carried away! I'm your opponent now! This is... Jidanda?! Wow! That looks cool! But it's huge. It's heavy. It's not about using strength! Use your technique to maneuver it. Technique... So that's Iou's new invention? If you hand it over quietly,
we'll spare your life. This is mine! Then we'll just take it from you! Damn. Neji! I'll take you out first! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Let's go! Rapid fire! Neji! Naruto! I must do something!
I'm the team captain. I'm out of bullets. Reload complete. No fair! What was that just now?! Like I know! It's about time we end this. Neji! Naruto! Out of the way! She attacked with the handle?! It stretched like my spear! Can you do it? Yes! Guys! Let me handle them! R-Right! Explode! Explode! Explode! Explode! She intends to control it through
the recoil of the explosions! Explode! So the blast isn't just to
move the steel ball! It also acts as a defensive shield. Go! I'll stop her! Right! We did it! We stopped her! Explode! - What?!
- What?! Wow! Well done! You mastered Jidanda admirably! Sir Iou... Then you'll let me have Jidanda?! No! Huh? I found a few adjustments
that need to be made. Shoseki, let's get started. Please give it back. Huh?! You can't do that. You are quite adept with ninja tools. Take all the first-rate weapons
you want. Mission complete, Tenten. Don't be so disappointed! You were so cool, Captain. You two... Oh well! Shall we get going? Huh? Okay. I hope they're done making
adjustments on Jidanda! So this is Training Ground Zero.

 Let's hurry up and
catch that ostrich!

 The way I figure...

 No matter whom we're up against,
I'll beat them!

 By the way,
have you three teamed up before?

 Umm... Nope!

 I'm really not sure about this.

 But in any case,
let's start our mission!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Animal District"


 What the hell are these guys?!


 Tune in again!

 Back when I was a bit younger
and a bit more feisty, my greatest rival was
a kid named Naruto. - Naruto? Naruto?
- Naruto? Naruto? A terrible brat who threatened
my freedom. Time was passing him by
while he stood helpless. It must have been
one of his lowest times. Sasuke had left the village and he was questioning
his own strength. That's right! Tsunade was
named the Lady Hokage, and it was before
he had set out with Jiraiya. Now keep quiet! Hear the story about
Naruto and me! What?! Look for a pet? That's a mission for a rookie!
No thanks! There's a reason
why you must go. Hey, this is... He ran away again? Furthermore, that ostrich
has trained himself to become a ninja ostrich. Wait, what? A ninja ostrich? You're dead wrong if you think this mission is simply
about finding a pet! Excuse me, Lady Hokage. What sort of odd job
do you have for me next? I'm appointing you as team captain. Team captain?
Did you say team captain?! Me?! Kotetsu Hagane. You will lead a specially formed team
to capture an ostrich. Yes, ma'am! Huh? An ostrich? The ostrich escaped into
the Hidden Leaf training grounds. Training grounds? You mean
where the Chunin Exam was conducted? Where we saw those giant centipedes? We used Training Ground 44
for the Chunin Exam. You're going to
Training Ground Zero. There's a Ground Zero? Yes. However, it's not used
for drills anymore. In fact, it's become a preserve for fierce and unusual beasts
of prey from throughout the world and entry is prohibited. That was when I was a kid. So it's a complete mystery
how the ecology has changed. It's also called
the "No Hunting Area." CLOSED DOWN So this is Training Ground Zero. That ostrich... Why'd it have to escape here
of all places? The way I figure,
it came to this place because... My arms are itching for action! And so are my legs! No matter who we're up against,
I'll beat them! By the way, have you three
teamed up before? Now that you mention it... Well... No, that is because I... All right, fine! Let's go. Curse you, Lady Hokage. She just assigned
any genin who was around. What?! Kotetsu, is a team captain?! Huh? What's the matter, Izumo? You sent just him on a mission? It's not that I felt there was
a difference in your abilities. Kotetsu was available,
that's all there is to it. So don't let it bother
you so much, Izumo. Why didn't I get to go with Kotetsu?! Stop whining, you cry baby! - Leaf's History - 
Animal District We'll proceed in
a single-line formation. Naruto, you're first. Right! I'll go next. If anything happens to
the first in line, I'll back him up. Then Shino. Stay alert to
your left and right sides. Finally, Lee. You bring up the rear. Understood. I should be the rear guard. What?! That's because someone with
eyes in the back of his head is perfect as the rear guard. I admit I don't have eyes in
the back of my head, but do you? Not literally. But my vision is similar to seeing
with compound eyes. Just get to the point, Shino! You want to say that your insects
will watch our backs, right?! Don't rush to a conclusion. That's because,
unless the captain agrees, we can't change positions. You take the rear, Shino. And you'll also be my lieutenant. What?! If there's a lieutenant,
I should be the one! I'm the only one who's familiar
with the ostrich! That's why you're in the lead position. Now, start walking. By the way, Captain. Where's the ostrich supposed to be? Huh? I thought you knew. Lady Hokage said so. I only know what he looks like. I don't know where he is. Lady Hokage! Why didn't you assign
sensory-type ninja on this mission?! Like a Hyuga or an Inuzuka... They're all gone. Lady Hokage... So...what'll we do? I'll find it. Shino? So you're from the Aburame clan. I'm counting on you! Did you locate it yet, Shino? It's a huge area. Calm down. This is like a tropical jungle. Don't laugh! It's your fault that I got
assigned to this silly mission! It's useless talking to it. No... Keep distracting him. Wh-What is it? I'll surround him. Go for it, Shino! Of course.
That goes without saying. All right! In that case,
leave this one to me! Your pa's belly button is an outie! What's with that laugh?! And why shouldn't he laugh? He's taking you for a fool. Wh-What?! It's certainly true that
he has a father. But you can't say that
the father has an outie. You are such a pain! Get to the point, Shino! That's because ostriches
come from eggs. They don't have belly buttons! Damn! Making a fool of me! Enough! Well, Shino, are you done? Strange... What is it? My insects are not reacting. Don't tell me...those are... insectivorous plants? Kofura, Kopushi, Komure... Kononoka, Komiruwa, Konomo,
Kogure, Kokoko, Koeoku... Hey, calm down! My insects...
Half of them were eaten. You're not getting away. Hey! Let's go, Shino. I can't go any further. That's because I risk
losing more insects. Then take another route
and meet us! Hey! Hold it! So fast! It's an ostrich, all right. Leave it to me. My leg strength has
Guy Sensei's seal of approval! Just get going! Yes, sir! Bushy Brow sure is fast! Get ready! Here he comes! What?! This foreign taijutsu, it's boxing! Huh? Hey, what happened
to Bushy Brow? Here I come, Naruto! Bring it on! Huh?! Did he just talk?! I knew someone would
come after me, but I never expected you.
It must be fate. However, fate ends here, Naruto. I'll defeat you and become
truly free! Hey ostrich. Don't get too excited
just from defeating Naruto! I'm still here. The captain! Captain? Then you go down first. Don't underestimate humans! Ostrich Aerial! I-Impossible... Captain! Sorry... But this time, I'm serious! Ostrich Hurricane! What's wrong, Kotetsu? Wh-What was that just now?! Ostrich Rising Dragon Kick! We make a pretty good team. That couldn't have been... Shining Ostrich Kick! Let's also become jonin some day. It's a flashback. A vision you see before death. Am I going to die here? Against an ostrich? Don't get too carried away! 'Cuz I'm your opponent now! Wait, Naruto! Let's retreat for now. So, you throw a variety
of speedy punches. However, you can't win
with punches alone. I use my legs, do body throws,
as well as locking techniques. That punch is old news. You are just an animal, after all! What was that just now?! A tail?! One, two, three.
That tail came as a surprise, but it's a monotonous combination. One, two, three... That's as far as you'll get! Where did that come from?! Let's fall back for now! We took them too lightly. Yes. We thought they were
nothing more than animals. But they're not. They have the intelligence
to lure and separate us. They can talk, and fight with skill. We can't go easy on them. Our mission is to capture. But I'll look the other way
if you overdo it a bit. Go Captain! That's such a relief to hear. It's better than getting beaten up
by an ostrich or kangaroo. Listen up, humans! Get out of here now! This land belongs to us,
the animals! If humans domesticate us, we'll end up losing
our fangs and claws! You don't have fangs! Silence! You can never capture me! For I am codenamed, Condor! Don't call yourself "Condor" when
you're nothing but an ostrich! Who cares! We won't stand for anyone
who takes away our freedom! We'll show you the power of
the Four Ninja Animal Warriors! Four Ninja Animal Warriors?
What a laugh. You can't even count! Let's attack! I already am. Wh-What?! An anteater?! It's an insectivore! My insects... - Let's go, Bushy Brow!
- Right! You again? Well, it won't go like the last time. You're not getting away! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Clone Jutsu! An ostrich who does Clone Jutsu?! They're just clones!
There's only one that's real! An ostrich that can
do Shadow Clones. I get it, Captain!
They're all real ostriches! He even had them waiting
for an ambush? Damn you! I'm serious this time. Leaf Hurricane! Wha-?! Four Ninja Animal Warriors...
I get it now. Lee! Guess it's either do or die. Bring it on! Here I come! You're mine! Substitution Jutsu?! Captain! Behind you! What?! What's wrong, Kotetsu. Not again... We make a pretty good team. Th-That really was... Let's also become jonin
some day. You and I. A-A flashback. I'm going to die after all. Sorry, Izumo! I can't keep my promise. Kotetsu, dodge! I'm even starting to hear his voice. Don't give up! Stand up! Ostrich Meteor Blast! Reinforcements, eh? Izumo! You! We'll use that attack! R-Right! I'm counting on you! Water Style: Syrup Trap! You're mine! W-Wait! I don't think so! Let's go! Crushed... It's finally over. My side too. I also managed somehow. Izumo... Thanks for coming.
You were a lifesaver. If you hadn't come, I'd be... There's one problem, though. I came without finishing up
some business for Lady Hokage. When we get back,
it'll be my turn to help you out. Hey... Damn it! Don't try running away again. I'm sure you would understand, but... What is it? You jerk! It's sticky! Don't think I'm going to give up! This is the fate Naruto and I share. He'll keep interfering with my freedom. Hey! Condor! Did you run away again?! We'll continue this... next time! Hey, wait! Idiot, idiot, idiot! Condor! You idiot! Idiot! The Special Youth Drink
I make for Lee

 requires a necessary ingredient:
the Jofuku Flower.

 It's a mystical plant that
only grows at Mount Jofuku,

 near the borderline of the Land of Fire.

 It is said to glow in seven colors,
and cures all sort of illness!

 But because of it's rarity,
it cannot easily be picked or...

 Then I'll go get them for you!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ah, the Medicine of Youth"


 Will you let me finish my sentence?!


 So this is Lord Jiraiya's secret code? From what I heard, Shikamaru and the Cipher Corps
are working to decipher it. Jeez! Why didn't Lady Tsunade come to us? We can't keep our fans happy with boring duties like
gate-keeping and archiving data. IZUMO/KOTETSU: LISTEN TO OUR ORDERS.
SHIKAMARU: WHAT A PAIN.






Back then, we were proctors
for Shikamaru and the others.


 SHIKAMARU: BEING A CHUNIN ISN'T MY THING.
IZUMO: HE CAUGHT UP WITH US.







Now, he's the same rank as us.


 SHIKAMARU: MAKE YOURSELVES USEFUL AT TIMES.
IZUMO: ...
KOTETSU: ...






No, he's higher than us.


 Well, there's only one thing to do! We'll just have to decipher
this code before they do! - And leave them speechless!
- And leave them speechless! Izumo, Kotetsu,
I have a job for you. Sorry to interrupt. - Wait! No, no!
- Wait! No, no! - It's not what you think, Lady Tsunade!
- It's not what you think, Lady Tsunade! Tune in again!

 Sakura... How is Lady Hokage? I see. Sakura, Guy Sensei prepared
this medicine. Please give it to Lady Hokage. Lee... Lady Hokage healed my body. MEDICINE

I want to do whatever I can
to help her recovery. I'll be straight with you. Give up being a ninja. There are numerous bone fragments in the area around
important nerves. Moreover, they are deeply embedded. You're not physically capable of carrying out
the missions of a ninja. Guy Sensei...  Please tell me! Why did this kind of thing
happen only to me? What should I do? - Leaf's History -
Ah, the Medicine of Youth


 Ino! Are you here to check up on Lee, too? I knew you'd be here. I came here to look for you two. You weren't at Sasuke's, so I figured you'd be here,
and waited. Ino, don't tell me you went
to visit Sasuke alone, did you? I just thought you were visiting as
an excuse to make a move on him. Speak for yourself! I told you,
I was just looking for you two! For what?! The three of us are going
on a mission! Mission? Why us three? Sasuke, from your team,
is in bad condition. As for our team, Lady Hokage
has called up Shikamaru and Choji to help with Village repairs. It's a D-rank mission, so they're probably scraping together
whoever is available. We finally get a mission and you just spoiled it for me
with the way you put it. Yo! Bushy Brow! Oh, Sakura... Shouldn't you say, "Oh, Naruto"? How are you feeling? Oh yes... I'm fine. R-Really, I feel great! Especially since Guy Sensei made me
this special youth drink! Oh thanks.
My hand slipped. It tastes awful! This is no energy drink! Oww! Idiot! What are you doing?! If you're going scold me, Sakura,
could you do it before hitting me? Th-That was my last special youth drink. Was it that precious to you? I-I'm sorry. Until now, I drank five liters daily
and never missed a single day. Five liters?! You mean, this awful-tasting thing? If I kept drinking it,
I would recover without fail. That is what Guy Sensei said. If you have the guts to
drink this super-bad stuff, you'll have no problem getting well. Your Ninja Way is to
never give up, right? You're right. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL

 HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL

I'm gonna go and see Guy Sensei. Naruto! We have a mission! Wait for me at the South Main Gate. I'll be right back! Cripes! He'll never change. Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that will destroy the body
of the practitioner? I'm prepared for the worst. Please teach me that
Forbidden Jutsu! Everything is for my dream. Guy Sensei? Oh, Naruto. What is it? No... Well, it's about Lee's medicine. I see... You already gathered data. Well done! Huh?! One ingredient is absolutely
essential for Lee's medicine. And that is the jofuku flower! Jofuku flower? The jofuku flower is a mystical plant
that grows in one place only. At the foot of Mount Jofuku at
the border of the Land of Fire. It is said to glow in seven colors,
and cures all sorts of illness! Mount Jofuku... It's a rare flower that
is difficult to obtain. So... If you had the flower,
you could make the medicine? Huh?! Then I'll go get them for you! Hey, wait, wait! Will you let me finish my sentence?! Just you wait, Bushy Brow! I'll get it right away! Hey, I know! That's odd.
I know it was around here. Found it! Naruto is late. What is that idiot doing?! I know he's worried about Lee,
but we have a mission. Sakura! Sorry to keep you two waiting! Naruto... What's with that get-up? It looks sorta familiar. I'm gonna search for
a medicinal herb for Bushy Brow. This outfit helps me get in sync
with Bushy Brow. Not bad, eh? "Not bad," you say? Can't you tell from our reaction? Come on, Naruto! Have you forgotten
that we have a mission! But I have to go to Mount Jofuku
to get some medicinal herbs. Mount Jofuku? Yeah! Mount Jofuku! For this mission,
our destination is Mount Jofuku. Huh?! You mustn't do that, Lee! You were told to take it easy
until the surgery! I'm sorry... But I thought I should build up
my strength a little. Lee... I understand how frustrating
this is for you. However, in do-or-die situations where
you can't forge ahead or fall back, sometimes staying still brings
about the best result. Having faith in yourself and
waiting quietly until the time comes. That too is courage, Lee. Yes... Naruto, Lady Hokage treated Lee, right? Of course! But hasn't Lee seemed
out of sorts lately? Like he has no energy. That can't be helped.
He was badly injured. It's not that.
He's not positive like before. He missed his rehab sessions
a few times too. Even today, the usual Lee would... Sakura, so that I can protect you,
I'll get better a day sooner. No, an hour, a minute,
a second sooner! It would have been more normal
if he welcomed me like that. Just for you? But...I think Sakura has a point. Remember, his injuries
were so serious even the Medical Team
couldn't heal him. It wouldn't surprise me if
a complete recovery was impossible. If Lee were told that... Granny Tsunade will absolutely
make him well! I'm just saying that sometimes it's not right to give
someone false hope! Huh? You may want to cheer him up, but sometimes it can become
a burden that has the opposite effect! That's why you should stop telling Lee
to "hang in there" so casually, Naruto! Bushy Brow isn't such a softie. When I watched him battle Gaara
during the Chunin Exam, I thought he was an amazing guy who was ready to put
his life on the line. Until the very end,
until he lost consciousness, he stayed on the attack. I realized he was a guy who
would never, ever give up. There's no way I can understand
the suffering he's going through now. But he's doing everything in
his power to overcome it. I believe in him. That's why I want to tell
Bushy Brow to hang in there! Naruto... By the way, what's our mission? Now you ask? We're to deliver a secret message
to a village located at the foot of Mount Jofuku. That's an easy one. Let's finish it up quickly,
so I can go pick some jofuku flowers. Say, let's take a break. I want to grab something to eat. Say, Sakura?
Were you even listening just now? Are you going to the jofuku forest? Y-Yes. We need to find some
medicinal herbs. You'd be wise to turn back. Why is that? In these parts,
it's called the lost woods. Villagers don't go near it. The lost woods? This was the site of ancient battles. The ghosts of ninja who were killed here
wander the forest. That's the legend. Gh-Ghosts? My slipper strap broke! My mirror broke! - It's all bad luck!
- It's all bad luck! There's no such thing as ghosts. They're just fake rumors! Old lady, more tea please! That was one creepy old lady, huh? She was scarier than a real ghost! DO NOT ENTER



That was so mean of her. DO NOT ENTER



 DO NOT ENTER



Huh? What's that? Looks pretty suspicious to me. Isn't this the forest
the old lady was talking about? So the jofuku flower is in there? All right! Our mission comes first, Naruto! I'll be right back! He never listens! What'll we do? We can't just leave him. DO NOT ENTER - It's all bad luck!
- It's all bad luck! A flower that glows in seven colors. Just like Guy Sensei said. Naruto! Sakura, take a look. This is the jofuku flower? I never heard of a flower that glows
in seven colors. There are flowers that
even florists don't know about? Well, this is a medicinal herb! Guy Sensei can make
Bushy Brow's medicine with this. What's that? Could it be...a ghost? What is that? Doesn't it look similar to
the jutsu to control sand? The one used by Gaara of the Sand. G-Gaara! What's he doing here? Let's retreat for now! You're right! Naruto! Why attack us all of a sudden? He seems to be after Naruto. Ino... He's wide open right now. Can you check out his real identity? You got it! Mind Transfer Jutsu! No way... What happened? There's no consciousness there. You're dealing with a different me today! Can't keep...running away! You keep copying Gaara! Well then... Shadow Clone Jutsu! I don't have taijutsu
like Bushy Brow. But... I have my own style
of fighting! He even has sand armor! Well then, how's this?! U-zu-ma-ki! Naruto Barrage! And for the finish... Rasengan! - Naruto!
- Are you all right?! I beat it. Finally, Bushy Brow can... Hey! What are you doing to
the precious jofuku flowers?! You're going to make them wilt! Who is that? Our apologies.
Here is the secret message. You live in this lonely forest
all by yourself, old lady? Not old lady. My name is Furofuki! As a Medical Ninja
from the Hidden Leaf, I'm studying the jofuku flowers. It's what I love doing,
so leave me alone! Umm... That thing we encountered is like a guardian deity of
the jofuku flower? When an attempt is made to pull it out,
the jofuku flower protects itself. It searches the perpetrator's mind
for an image of his archenemy, transforms into it, and then attacks. We were thinking of Gaara. Too bad we didn't think of Choji.
Then we coulda won easily! If you hadn't trespassed into
the jofuku forest, this would never have happened. - We're sorry.
- We're sorry. Sure am. I-It's so heavy!
Are these all jofuku flowers? Yes. Your mission is to take
this back to the village. - Ino...
- Ino... Blame the one who ordered
this mission, not me. Rejoice, Lee! I brought you
the greatest gift today! It's my handmade special
stamina recovery pills of love! These herbal pills were made
with my sweat, tears and love! And filled with the warm friendship
of your comrades! Friendship of my comrades? Yes. The medicinal herb necessary
to make these were obtained by none other than Naruto
and his team. Sakura? Yes, Sakura and Ino. Which means, these herbal pills
are filled with Sakura's love too. Sakura... In order to repay
your kindness, I will recover a day sooner. No, an hour, a minute,
a second sooner! If you eat a hundred of these,
you won't need to fear surgery! One hundred, right? Oh wait... Now hold on! So how many must I eat daily? I see you're not making
the same mistake this time. Bravo, Lee. However, this time, it's 100 in one day! I won't let you suffer alone! While you are eating,
I'll do 1000 speed push-ups! Why do I have to train to break free
of genjutsu now?

 Don't you remember what
your goal for training was?

 Huh? To bring back Sasuke, of course!

 Sasuke possesses the Sharingan. 

 Naturally, he will learn to
master genjutsu. 

 Unless you have the means
to counter that,

 you can't possibly achieve your goal.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Gutsy Master and Student: The Training"


 We shall now begin training
to break genjutsu!


 Tune in again!

 If you intend to pursue Sasuke,
then forget about training. Anbu Black Ops will watch you,
and depending on the situation, you may be forbidden from
leaving the Leaf Village. You are not an ordinary kid.
You have the Nine-Tails inside you. The situation being what it is, if you ignore my words
and act willfully, I won't have a choice. In time, you will be forced
to deal with someone more troublesome than Orochimaru. So you must forget about Sasuke. This was bound to happen
sooner or later, it's fate. Don't suffer anymore.
Put it behind you. It's not just jutsu and power. A ninja must also hone
his judgment and his ability to make
the right choices. If you are a ninja, become wiser. Fools cannot survive in our world.
That is the reality. Fine. So I'll stay a fool for the rest of my life. Even if I have to do it alone,
I'll figure out some amazing jutsu and save Sasuke, no matter what! And, and I'll pulverize the Akatsuki! If someone like you tries
to do it alone you'll probably come up with
some silly Pervy ninjutsu. But maybe, a big fool like you
might be able to manage something. Be ready when you're discharged,
you fool of fools. So long. Yeah! Just watch me. What're you doing?
Let's go, Naruto! You got it! - Leaf's History -
Gutsy Master and Student:
The Training


 Why do I have to train to break
free of genjutsu now? Don't you remember what
your goal for training was? Sasuke! I won't let Orochimaru
have you! Even if I have to break
every bone in your body, I'll stop you! Just what are you anyway? Your friend! That's why I'm telling you,
Orochimaru can't have you. I'm weak. That's why I couldn't stop him. I couldn't bring him back! That's why... That's why I have to
become strong, for his sake! Yes.  You're right. Then why?! He has the Sharingan. Someone who possesses the Sharingan
and can manipulate ocular power will obviously be good
at genjutsu. It goes without saying that
Sasuke will have mastered genjutsu. If you cannot defend
yourself against it, how do you expect to bring him back? Okay, I get it. The enemy takes control of
your inner chakra. That is genjutsu. If you can create a disturbance
within your own chakra, the genjutsu itself cannot work. I don't know if
I can do such a thing. You've already had experience doing it. Huh? I did? During your Rasengan training, you learned to release chakra
and rotate it in your palms. All right! Just watch me! So, that's it? Yes. Instead of releasing chakra
into your palms, you disrupt it inside your body. That's easy. All right then.
Let's get some real practice! Huh?! Summoning Jutsu! Oh, if it isn't Jiraiya Honey! Thank you for coming so far,
Mr. Gamariki. Oh come on, no need to be so polite. I-I can't breathe. Oh, who is this cute boy? He's Naruto. Huh?! What is this guy?! Hello, Naruto boy. He's sorta creepy. I have a favor to ask,
Mr. Gamariki. I want you to teach him
how to break a genjutsu. What should I do? Well, since none other than
Jiraiya Honey is asking me.  Naruto! Come on, you must ask him too!
 H-Hey, stop it! What're you doing? So cute. Let's train right away, Naruto boy! What?! I'll be very gentle. What is this place? Where exactly am I? Huh? Pervy Sage? Hey, Pervy Sage! Where the heck is this? You are in the genjutsu world, my boy. D-Don't come near me. I'm not letting you escape! I'm gonna break this genjutsu quickly
and get out of here! Let's see... Disrupt the chakra inside my body. These dumplings are awfully good. Oh? Jeez! What are you releasing? I told you,
disrupt the chakra inside you! No! You fool! Release! Huh? What happened? You tried to disrupt chakra
inside the genjutsu world, but in reality you released it
and set it off. Oh, I failed then. This means it's back
to basic chakra control, rather than actual combat training. I don't think Naruto boy
and I are compatible. Disrupt inside my body. Once more! This is harder than
doing the Rasengan. Rotate it inside my body. Yes! That's the way! You keep releasing it. You've got a ways to go. Well... We have lots of time. Pervy Sage. Let's just call it a day. Here. Eat. Say! Say! Why did you choose me? I guess when it comes to
amazing Sage Jutsu, only someone with my level
of talent can inherit it, right? Long ago, I taught the Fourth Hokage. And you have an uncanny
resemblance to him. I guess that's the only reason. I resemble the Fourth Hokage? Naruto is Minato's son
and precious keepsake. He's like a grandson to me. If Naruto could carry
on my dreams, then Good! I guess we can move on
to the next step in training. Say, say.  Why are we changing
locations to practice? Is there a decent genjutsu master
someplace else? A sea of forest surrounds
the village where we are headed. A special magnetic field exists
in that area that affects a person's chakra flow
in the brain. Hence, if anyone traveling through
the region takes the wrong path, he could end up in a situation
similar to being under a genjutsu. It's the perfect location to
wrap up your genjutsu training. Wow!  Sounds like fun! All right! Let's go! Let's do it! Pervy Sage! When are we gonna
reach this village? We're almost there. Huh? I don't see a thing. If you wander,
you'll end up in a genjutsu. Oww! Cripes, what the hell? What's this? I don't know! There was nothing like
this the last time I came. Hey! Chili pepper? That's powerful. Go away! What's the big idea?! We're not enemies. Huh? Aren't you Tanishi? Its me, Jiraiya. Your parents provided
generous hospitality when I last visited here to
do research on my novel. What?! You're Tanishi, after all. I remember that mole
on your forehead. What's going on?
You know this kid, Pervy Sage? How are Sukune and Yone? Shut up! Don't come near here! No one can come near this village! Why not? Shut up! What's wrong, Tanishi? Did something happen? Hurry and go! There'll be trouble if they see you! Hey! What's going on? Let's take our leave for now, Naruto. Jeez, what's up with that? It was a peaceful village when I last came. But something made those
once friendly villagers put up a wall to keep strangers out,
and even arm themselves. This isn't something
we can simply ignore. I'll take over guard duty. Thanks. There are two suspicious characters
hanging around. Be careful. Got it. You must be tired
from all-night guard duty. Go and get some rest, Tanishi. Yeah. Don't make any noise. We just want to help. Tell me what's going on in the village. Okay, okay. Just put that down. Sorry. But I didn't want to
start a commotion. Where is Sukune? Please leave. If they find out you're in the village,
the other villagers will get killed. What do you mean? We've come to borrow
the power of this area. In order to perfect our genjutsu! You villagers can live inside
my genjutsu. Mom! Dad! Our village has been protected
by illusions and we have lived in harmony
with illusions. We discovered a way to
get out of illusions using these red balls made
from chili peppers. Don't worry, everyone! I, Sukune, promise to protect you! You guys! Get out of our village! It would be smarter to help me. The illusions made by the trees
are blessings from the gods to protect our village! They are not for your protection!  He's right! Get out!
 Get out! Change! What? Starting now I, Kandachi,
will rule this village. The women and children
are hostages! If any word about us
leaks out of the village, consider the hostages dead! Don't kid yourself! As if we'd let you have
your way with us! Dad! This is nothing. Defying me is useless. Dad, stop! Don't fight anymore! This village... Don't be stupid! Stop! does not belong to you! Stop! Dad was murdered. The women and children
were taken hostage. So there's no way
the men can fight back. So that's what happened. Your dad was a great man. Shut up! Dad was a fool. What are you saying? He's a brave man who tried
to save the village! I'm not going to be a fool like him! He threw his life away against
someone he couldn't beat! Hey, you. If we don't do a thing,
we won't get killed. That's our only option! So please... Don't do anything more. Just leave before those guys find you! And you call yourself Understood! Pervy Sage?! Then you'll leave?! Forgive me. I can understand
his reasons, but I can't just leave
the villagers I'm indebted to. That's more like it! Tanishi?! Tanishi! Is he one of the two
suspicious men you mentioned? Damn right, he
I mean, yes, he is. And they call me the Great Jiraiya. I was so careless. Let's take him to Lord Kandachi
right away. Yeah. The other one should be
wandering around nearby. So stay on the lookout here.  Right.
 Right. That island is... Looks like the hostages are
being kept there. It's all your fault.
You guys ruined everything!

 You're wrong.

 Do you really believe that he'll release
the hostages one day?

 But...

 Tanishi, remember your father's actions!

 Think about why he chose to fight!

 If you keep believing that your father
died a senseless death,

 this village will never be saved!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Record of the Gutsy Ninja Master and Student


 We won't let you guys
have this village!


 Tune in again!

 "Record of the Gutsy Ninja Master
and Student"


 Lord Kandachi! It appears our real enemy is finally
making his appearance. Lord Kandachi... We captured the suspicious fellow
who trespassed into our village. Kid, did you catch him? Y-Yes, sir. You actually caught Jiraiya, one of the Sannin of the Hidden Leaf. I know that ugly mug. You're Kandachi, known as Hanzo of
the Salamander's right-hand man! What a place to run into you. Don't tell me you deserted your village? The Hidden Rain village
no longer has a leader. In fact, it's no longer our village. Oh? If we hadn't hidden ourselves, we'd probably have been killed
as rebels too. Kid! You'll be rewarded for
bringing Jiraiya here. Tell me what you want. He's not me! He's a fake! Huh?! T-Two Tanishis?! What's going on? Who are you?! Why did you have to show up now,
of all times?! You're... Yup... I figured as much. Kid, you let Jiraiya enter
the village, didn't you? Huh?! You're gonna pay a hefty price for that. Mom! W-What are you going to do?! I'm gonna keep my promise! And feed your friends to Conch King! My word... Ninja Art! Conch Whip! Stop! Please stop! Damn him! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What an unusual jutsu you use. Here I come! Rasengan! What?! Naruto! That's why I told you
to stay out of this! I beg you! Please spare the lives
of my village friends! Not likely. Because I made you a promise. Please! Please spare everyone. Tanishi... You're asking the wrong person. It made no difference whether
we came or not. Do you really believe that
he'll release the hostages one day? Remember your father Sukune! Think about why he chose to fight! If you keep believing that your father
died a senseless death, this village will never be saved! Pervy Sage! Get everyone
out of the cages! Right, leave it to me! I don't think so! Whoa! I'm your opponent! Fire Style: Flame Bombs! All right! My side's done! Got it! Shadow Clone Jutsu! You're still coming at me? You're a fool who doesn't know
how weak you are. Shut up! I can't sit still until I pulverize
cowards like you! You're a glutton for punishment! Conch Spear! Rasengan! Conch Whip! Give it up, Leaf brat. Nope, not yet. Until I bring you down,
I won't give up! If I went against my word,
I wouldn't be who I am! It's useless! D-Damn it... Conch Spear! This is nothing. No, not yet. Why? Why?! This village...does not
belong to you! Why?! Desperately charging at a foe
you have no chance of beating. You are such a fool. Yeah... If that's what fools do,
I'm a fool. I'm a giant fool who never gives up
once my mind is made up! If you keep believing that
your father died a senseless death, this village will never be saved! Damn... Damn... Damn! H-Hey... I... I... I... Tanishi, get everyone to safety! You can do that much, can't you? I'm going to beat that guy! What are you doing? Hurry, go! O-Okay. Tanishi, what are you going to do?! I'm going to save everyone! You're going to defy Lord Kandachi?! Obeying him only meant
he kept us alive. Now you're talking! Spoken like
a true son of Sukune! I'll leave the rest to you! Right! Okay, everyone. I'll let you out now! Jeez, don't blame me
if things get worse! Ready, pull! Sorry to keep you waiting, Kandachi. I thought I could kill some time
with this kid, but I guess not. Are you all right, Naruto?! Oh yeah... I have lots left in me. Hurry, this way! Ninja Art! Needle Jizo! What?! I'll back you up. Finish him off, Naruto! Time for your payback. Right! There's no way he can beat me. So both of you are fools, eh?
Well then... I'll take care of both of you
with this jutsu! Water Style Genjutsu!
Mystic Fog Prison! What is that? W-What? Pervy Sage?! What's going on? Damn it! M-My hand... You cannot weave signs, can you? I-It's no good. I can't move my body at all. We're almost there. Hurry, everyone. What happened to them? Lord Kandachi... They were touched by the breath
of the Conch King and are under a genjutsu. We'll finish them off. Take it easy. But... We chose this site because
the special magnetic field created by the trees surrounding
this swamp greatly increases
the genjutsu power of the Conch King. Even someone like Jiraiya
cannot break this genjutsu. Furthermore, these two will be overcome
by fear due to their paralysis. It's just a matter of time before
they have a mental breakdown. Damn... I can't move. Instead, go and get the runaway villagers! Yes sir! They won't find you here. Stay put until I come back. But where are you going, Tanishi? You're not going out there! You'll be killed this time! I finally understand... that you can't just keep running away. But against those monsters?!
Don't be a fool! A fool? I'm a giant fool who never gives up
once my mind is made up! Yeah... So I'm a fool. If I went against my word,
I wouldn't be who I am. That Hidden Leaf fellow taught me. Dad probably felt the same way. If we just do whatever
they tell us to do, we'll lose sight of ourselves. Well said, Tanishi! Mom! You're Sukune's son, after all! Please look after the others! You bet! Be careful. Yeah. W-What happened?! We were caught inside
a genjutsu until now. Naruto, it's a chili pepper ball. Close your eyes! Impossible... They broke out of the genjutsu?! H-Hot... Naruto, wake up! Y-You?! Why didn't you run away?! I decided to become a big fool like you! That's great! Now leave the rest to me! Then you take care of
the big one by yourself. Huh?! A Shadow Clone?! What?! How did you escape my genjutsu?! You see... It was just a clone that fell
under your genjutsu. Pervy Sage! Naruto! Do you have any chakra left? Yeah! I have loads and loads of it. Then we'll start with the big one! But Rasengan won't work on him! That was a failed attempt. Remember your training. You should be able to release
a huge Rasengan, like the one you created that
sent Mr. Gamariki flying! I get it! All right! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here we go! Right! Hey, are you serious? That jutsu won't work
on the Conch King. All right... Just like the last time,
but outside my body. You don't know when to give up,
do you, fool?! I'll get you first! Well? How's it coming along?! Just a little more.
Give me a little more time! All right! I'll confine it! Art of the Raging Lion's Mane! How long do you think
you can hang on? Hurry! Getting tired, eh? Naruto... What? What is that?! Pervy Sage! Right! Damn it! Repel him! Here I go! Giant Rasengan! Well done! Why?! Why'd you take hostages
and try to rule over the village? You could of just asked the village
to hide you guys! Like I'd trust strangers. I'm Kandachi of the Hidden Rain.
I'm no fool. If you had been one,
things would've been much easier. We did it. Dad, the village is at peace again. The power of the trees
will protect us again. Dad... I'll protect Mom and the rest of
the village just as you did, Dad. I promise. Since we found out, I doubt that those Hidden Rain fellows
will return to this village. I've been able to repay Sukune
for his hospitality. Thank you so much. We're the ones who should
be thanking you. If Tanishi hadn't come that time, we'd have been finished off
in the genjutsu. You're probably right. Oww! He gets so carried away! Such a fool, this one. Minato... Naruto has grown up. Far better than I imagined. He's just as gutsy and tenacious
as the both of us. You were more than a teacher.
You were like a father to me. Sensei, I know he too will
love you like family. Then I guess that makes Naruto
my grandson. What're you muttering about, Pervy Sage? Oh, nothing. A grandson like you... A grandson like me? What the hell?! Are you going senile?! Now, now, don't say that
and come closer, grandson! What? That's creepy! Cut it out! Get away from me, Pervy Sage! Aw... Don't say that. Then I say I'll go this way,
and you can go that way, Pervy Sage! What? We're going to catch another cat?!

 Not quite.
It's actually a Nekomata.

 Your mission is to capture
its paw stamp.

 Whatever it is, it's a D-rank mission
so no thanks!

 Right, Sasuke?

 You guys don't have to come
if you don't want to.

 This is an Uchiha... No, MY mission.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Sasuke's Paw Encyclopedia"


 I will complete
this mission! Tune in again!

 PAW ENCYCLOPEDIA Haven't seen him in a long time. Granny Cat... Give me 400 ninja cat kunai knives
and 600 shuriken. Well, what a surprise that
you would come yourself. The Uchiha brat was
so cute back then. What?! We're going to catch
another cat?! Not quite. It's actually a Nekomata. Our mission is to get
the paw print of this Nekomata. Nekomata, or whatever! Let someone else go on
D-rank missions like that! Right, Sasuke? Aren't you tired
of missions like this? Speak up and tell him. Sasuke? If you don't like it, don't come. This is an Uchiha...
or rather, my mission. Why?! - Leaf's History -
Sasuke's Paw Encyclopedia


 I'm glad you came, Sasuke boy. It's been a long time, Granny Cat. My, how you've grown. You know her, Sasuke? What is this place anyway? This is the shop where
the Uchiha clan buys weapons. Granny Cat is the source of
invaluable data for the Uchiha. She is also our client
for this mission. Tamaki... Bring me the Paw Encyclopedia. Here you are, Granny. You turned that into a book?! Sasuke... You seem to know a lot
about this mission. Care to explain why? Originally, this book was a game between
Sasuke and his older brother Itachi. Don't talk about him! I'm going to start preparations
for the mission. What's with him? They used to be so close back then. Itachi often came by on errands
with little Sasuke in tow. But Sasuke would get bored,
throw tantrums, and give Itachi such a hard time. So Itachi came up with the game of gathering the paw prints
of quick and nimble cats. You mean a kid's game. Well yes. But he already had the skills of a genin
even before entering the Academy. He was an Uchiha all right. MIKE THE SWIFT

 MIKE THE SWIFT

Anyway, it was a cute game at first. Anyway, it was a cute game at first. TWO-SIDED WILD CAT

But things began to escalate. But things began to escalate. Sasuke completed nearly all the quotas
that Itachi half-jokingly assigned him. DREAD LION

And his collection of paw prints
became this book. But even after Sasuke stopped,
it's bothered me. As for one of two remaining quotas
that Itachi assigned, I asked Ni'i of the Hidden Cloud,
and she kindly agreed. Ni'i of the Hidden Cloud?
What's that? And so, you're asking us to
get the last one? However... Nekomata is a big shot in
the ninja cat underworld that never shows his face in public. He hides in an impregnable fortress. The number of ninja cats
who guard Nekomata is unknown. Can a three-man cell of genin manage this? Just leave it to us!
Right, Sakura? Even Itachi thought this was
too difficult for Sasuke and wouldn't allow him to go. You'll have to exercise extreme caution. So that's what was bothering Sasuke. I'll go beyond the boundary he set. Hey, Sasuke. Let's change into cats
and infiltrate that fortress! I guess the best way to infiltrate
a fortress of cats is to become one. Transformation Jutsu! How is that supposed to be a cat?! I thought I looked pretty good. You don't have to transform. Besides, transforming won't make
you understand cat talk. And so! If you put these on,
the cats will think you're one of them! If it's that simple, why didn't you give me
these from the very start?! I-I'm expected to wear this?! We're known in these parts,
so we can't go any further. No ninja cat has ever
seen Nekomata's face. Will you be able to find him? Thanks to these,
infiltrating will be quite easy. You look so cute, Sasuke! If we can get in successfully,
the rest will be easy. Let's go! Hold it. Sasuke, we're supposed to be able
to talk to ninja cats with this thing. Meaning there's no need
to start a fight. Let's just talk it out with him. I'm sure he'll be happy to give us
one or two of his paw prints. Impossible. Why's that? Having your paw print taken is
extremely embarrassing for a cat. For humans, it's like being stripped naked,
then photographed. Is that all? A nude photograph?
Just coax them gently. I mean, even Sakura would allow it. Right, Sakura? As if! You pervert! I think talking will be useless. Thanks for showing us the way. Get going, pervert. Next! I don't recognize you guys. We're newbie cats! Here. For someone new,
you're quick to catch on. What gave us away?! Like I know! This is a reward for you. New cats that get the idea are welcome! What's the matter?
You're welcome to it. W-We have to play along or
they'll get suspicious. I must do this to get
Nekomata's paw print! Hey, this is kind of fun. Stupid sneeze. This is fun. A human! There's a human in our midst! Huh?! W-What're you saying?! You idiot! Let's go! Hey, those two are suspicious too! They're impostors! Alert! Alert! S-Sasuke! Sakura! What business does a human have
with Boss Nekomata's fortress?!

 Get out! Get out, now!

 O-Okay, I get it! I'm guessing you're telling me
to leave, right? Okay, I'm going. Damn it. It's back to the drawing board! What's with all this security?
What's going on? I heard some human slipped in. A human?! If he's nearby, I'll snare him! We don't have to worry about Naruto. We'll take advantage of the commotion
and search for Nekomata. Sakura, you start from the east tower.
I'll take the west. Huh? At the very least,
we need a two-man team for this. They already know we've infiltrated.
Time is of the essence. It's smarter to split up for the search! O-Okay, I understand. What's all the commotion? Boss! A human! There's a human
who slipped into the fortress! A human infiltrator?!
Kick him out this instant! Right! A human? It's been seven years since... No, it couldn't be. If I can't get past the front gate, I'll just sneak in from
the side like a ninja. BAR CAT'S EYE

 BAR CAT'S EYE

The best place to get information is a bar. Your Matatabi drink, miss. Oh...I didn't order yet. It's from that customer over there. May I join you? Oh, yes. A new acquaintance.
This occasion calls for... You've gotta try this, it's so good! Say, do you know a cat named Nekomata? You mean, Boss? He always stays in
the main fortress tower. Oh, thank you. You can have this. Rigged plastic bottles?! These are supposed to be used
against cats! Not by cats! B-Boss is in the main tower. I'm sure Sasuke is also heading there. You don't look familiar. I-I'm new here. I see. So what do you want
with the boss? Oh no... He overheard
my earlier conversation. Who are you?! You must have infiltrated with
that human earlier! Small fries can stay out of this! Don't call me a small fry! I won't allow you to get near the boss! He's fast! If there's an opening,
it'll be the instant he lands! Cha! What was that just now? I know I landed a hit,
but there was no reaction. He's quick and flexible. Then I'll take advantage of his power
when he gets close! It's so obvious you want the counter. Y-You... Y-You're a human?! Well then... No mercy! Prepare to die! Cat's fur cannot repel water. When a cat's fur is drenched with water,
its body temperature drops rapidly. I-It's cold. I give up. We've been beaten! So you made it all the way here. Kid, who are you? Are you Nekomata? It'll be easy if you willingly
offer your paw. If not, it'll probably be quite painful. You have the guts to stand before me
and make such threats. What is this? Who are you? Sharingan! Disappear! Sharingan can see through genjutsu. Genjutsu has no effect on me! You're pretty good.
Then I'll go with brute strength! Sasuke... Here's the final blow! Snap out of it, Sasuke! Sasuke! Are you all right? Sakura... Naruto... So this is Nekomata? The headliner, Naruto Uzumaki, is here! Stay out of this! Huh?! He's mine! Besides...it's just about over! There's no need to dodge it. Paper bombs?! You didn't think I was just
running around, did you? Mission accomplished! You drew an unlucky number
that time, Nekomata. I wanted to have a go with him since he was Itachi's kid brother. Besides, I couldn't refuse
a request from Itachi. M-Monster! In time, my kid brother will come. When he does,
fight him with all your might. Although, with your strength, my brother doesn't have it
in him yet to beat you. Then why?! Growth occurs when one
goes beyond one's limits. Realizing that is also part of training. I hate to admit it, but Sasuke passed
Itachi's test with flying colors. Indeed. But how unfortunate... Those two brothers were so close. Old man. They call you the "Eternal Genin,"
but how long have you been doing this for?

 It'll be fifty years this year.

 That's some history!

 I had my share of memories with
each of the Hokages.

 Ah yes, I also had the chance

 to work alongside the great Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Legendary Sannin.

 With Pervy Sage?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto and the Old Soldier"

 Who is this old man? Tune in again!

<i>We're too late...</i> <i>Sasori...</i> Neji... Can you see what's happening
to me here? Yeah... The same thing is happening here. <i>Tenten, what about you?</i> It's probably...
the same here, too. <i>Lee!</i> A strange shadow appeared in the forest
as soon as I removed the tag. I thought so... Team Kakashi has infiltrated
just as planned. What is...this...? It's probably an enemy trap. I see... So that's what this is about. I find you a worthy opponent. <i>Traps Activate!
Team Guy's Enemies


</i> You jerk...! Where do you think you're sitting?! No doubt about it... He's the Jinchuriki. "The first one to yell and
scream at you," huh? Itachi's pretty good
at describing people. <i>Sasori...</i> Gaara! What're you doing sleeping leisurely
in a place like that?! Stand up! Gaara! Hey! Gaara! Are you listening?! Knock it off! That's enough, Naruto! You should know... That's right. You know, don't you? That he's already long dead. Oh... He's definitely...the Jinchuriki. Give him back... Give Gaara back! You jerks! Calm down... If you charge ahead without thinking,
we'll be annihilated. A Shinobi usually operates in a three-man squad
or a four-man squad. But at least five people are required
to destroy a Five-Seal Barrier. It can't be destroyed with
just one team. You'd have to wait for
another team to arrive. Just putting up a Five-Seal Barrier
should serve as a means for stalling... In addition, it's configured so that a trap activates when
the barrier is removed. Namely, a copy of the person who
removes the tag appears nearby. They're preventing us from making
our way through the barrier, huh? In other words... we can't go back up to
Naruto and the others unless we defeat ourselves... Is that how this works? <i>Exactly, Lee.</i> They break up the four-man squad
and separate us individually. And even taking precaution by placing
a back-up on the barrier... They're quite impressive. But...we can't just sit here
acting impressed. Now, let's fight! I'd expect no less from my fake!
He's pretty good. <i>They don't just look the same...</i> <i>They've got the same power too, huh...?</i> We should consider them as having
the same weapons too, huh...? So basically everything about them
is the same, huh? This makes them even
more worthwhile opponents, eh?! What is it, Sasori my man? <i>I'll  take him.</i> It seems that Jinchuriki wants
to take him back, so... It seems so. <i>It appears the guy on the left</i> <i>is the one who infiltrated
the Sand alone and took Gaara.</i> <i>Which means this guy's...</i> <i>the Puppet Master who
seriously injured Kankuro...</i> <i>Her grandson Sasori, huh?</i> My man... You'll probably get mad if I say this... <i>But I'll  take care
of that Jinchuriki.</i> Our mission is one Jinchuriki each. Don't be getting all full
of yourself, Deidara... An artist's passion starts to dull unless they seek
greater stimulation, my man... The rumor is the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki
is quite powerful. He's an opponent suitable for my art. What? You're calling those explosions
of yours art? Art is something that beautifully remains... extensively into the distant future. Eternal beauty is art! Eternal beauty...is art? I do respect you as
a fellow craftsman, my man. But art is a fleeting moment of beauty
that vanishes gloriously. What did you say...? Wh-What's up with...these guys? Deidara, it seems you don't
understand what true art is... <i>You're  the one
who doesn't understand.</i> You jerks...! No! Eternal beauty is true art. Don't be a fool.
Art is an instant of beauty. Knock it off! Do you want to make me angry? I just told you... It would probably make
you angry, didn't I...? You know what happens
when I get angry, don't you? <i>He blocked the shuriken
without looking at all...</i> <i>He's just as good with
the Puppet Master technique</i> <i>as he always was.</i> How about it, Deidara? Art to me is... explosiveness itself! It's a far cry from
your silly puppet shows! See you around, my man! <i>Make sure you follow me,
Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki...</i> <i>That jerk Deidara
is doing as he pleases...</i> Hey, wait! All right. Naruto! <i>I guess Naruto won't stop, will he?</i> Naruto and I will take care
of the guy outside. Sakura and Granny Chiyo...
you two handle the guy inside. However... make sure you don't do
anything rash until Team Guy gets back. Got it. He came too, huh...? Guy, can you hear me? The enemy has split up.
We need backup. Return immediately. <i>I don't think we can.</i> We've all been caught
in an enemy trap. Kakashi, give us a little more time. <i>Signing off!</i> <i>These movements...</i> We're an even match, huh? <i>I can't believe they look the same,
have the same power</i> <i>and even use the same Jutsu...</i> It's just like fighting our mirror images... If it were mirrors,
we only need to break it, but... Leaf Hurricane! It doesn't look like
they'll be easily broken. Give Gaara back! Looks like... I can't be wasting my time... I'd heard that you'd retired long ago. I suddenly wanted to see
my grandson's face again. <i>I can tell just by facing him.</i> <i>The incredible difference
in actual battle experience...</i> <i>and the number of people he's killed.</i> Sakura, do not fear. I'm here. You step back. Assault Blade. If you're going to defy me,
then I guess I have no choice... Will you join that kid as additions to my collection,
Grandma Chiyo? Only one event remains for
the World Puppet Master Championship! Will the proud title of
first Puppet Master Champion go to Sasori of the Red Sand,
the master craftsman who topped the first stage
all-round toxin quiz challenge?! Or will it go to Granny Chiyo, the Sand's Consultant who displayed
her years of experience and skills during the second-stage
Puppet-building race? Who will win the final stage,
the Puppet Battle?! Next Time:
Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi! Quite fascinating this boy,
Naruto Uzumaki. He managed to save our Village
from danger. I am Hayama, the team leader
for today's mission. Nice to meet you all. I've been dying for a mission,
Captain Hayama. Yeah! Say, old man, we're having
a strategy meeting before the mission. You're in our way, so scoot! Naruto... He's a member of our team. Huh? This old man is a ninja?! Haven't you heard of Kosuke,
the Eternal Genin? Eternal Genin? How long have you been
doing this for? It'll be fifty years this year. Fifty years?! I guess that's amazing,
in a way. Captain Hayama,
isn't there someone a little better? I personally asked Kosuke to join us. From what I understand,
he is very helpful to have around. And me? What about me? I didn't ask for you in particular, but I needed another genin
and you happened to be the one. Our mission is to patrol
the northern border. Patrol? Talk about an easygoing mission. True. If nothing goes awry,
it's an easy C-rank mission. However, we can't take anything
for granted right now. Hence, we're being dispatched. The destruction of the Hidden Leaf
just took place. So the ninja of other lands won't
let this opportunity pass. Is that it? Exactly, Tekuno. And so, our mission is to
keep our enemies in check. We will show our enemies that the Hidden Leaf ninja
are as vigilant as ever. I don't see anything around here! I found mushrooms! Hey old man... You shouldn't scatter
the area like that! Captain Hayama ordered us to
track enemy footprints, remember?! No traces of the enemy in this area. I agree. You agree? All you were doing was
picking mushrooms, old man! I'm done laying traps. Kosuke, is there somewhere
suitable to set up camp? Oh yes. The Second Hokage's cave
is near here. The Second Hokage? It's a cave I found when I came here in service
to the Second Hokage. H-How long ago was that? When you've been a genin
for fifty years as I have, chances are you've worked with many
who became great masters. I remember teaming up with Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Legendary Sannin, as well as Lord Sakumo,
known as the White Fang, back when they were still young. They sound like pretty
tall tales to me. Say, Naruto, would you mind catching
some crabs or fish with that? Can't! I've been assigned to
examine whatever floats downstream! So while you're at it... No way! Captain said to watch if any evidence
of the enemy floats by. Not bad! I laid the traps. Man, that smells good. Yum! It sure tastes good! Well then, I'm going to prepare our beds. See? Kosuke is good to have around. He sure is useful. I'm the one who caught the fish. You... Do you intend to spend
the rest of your life as a genin? How is it? Oh... Nothing suspicious. If no enemy shows up,
then that would be ideal. I'll take over the watch. Don't fall asleep. I'm not sleeping! - Leaf's History -
                       Naruto and the Old Soldier

 Hey! Come on, old man! There are no enemies in this area. How would you know such a thing? See these birds? They were completely
off guard to human presence. This tastes great! It's so good! Oh, is it? I'm glad you like it. I'm sure it was around here. It's a spring that the Third Hokage
and I discovered long ago. Just how long ago was this anyway? This is where I received a harsh lecture
from the Third Hokage. From Old Man Third Hokage? How come? He questioned if I had the Will of Fire. Will of Fire? Captain! There's a change in the air.
Be on your guard. What ninja are you? If you don't answer, we'll take this as trespassing into
the Land of Fire and... Tekuno, blow them up! There are still about twenty of them. This is more than a small scouting party. Captain Hayama! They got us hemmed in! The left and right are diversions!
Up above! Shock Blade! We're changing strategy. One of us must get away and make it back to the Leaf Village
to report this. Captain?! Tekuno, take charge. Yes, sir! Let's go. Come, Naruto. Earth Style?! I am Hidden Leaf Jonin,
Hayama Shirakumo! Don't think you'll get out
of here alive! Will the captain be all right
by himself? I have faith in him! The enemy seems to be
quite strong in numbers. The captain acted as a lure, and they still have enough men
to split up and pursue us?! What'll we do, Tekuno?! If we can buy some time, we'll be able to reach
our second line of defense. You need time? Leave it to me! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Go! What's the matter, Naruto? They already wiped out my clones! The enemy is right behind us! You two, go on ahead. But... You guys will only be in my way! Tekuno! Go! Come and get me! They've recruited some
awfully swift ninja. Leaf Ninja Art... Yanagi. So strong. Old man. What kind of jutsu was that? When you've been a genin for fifty years,
you pick up a few tricks. No way! No way was that a genin jutsu! Well, neither is your
Shadow Clone Jutsu, right? That's... I had my reasons. I also had my share of reasons
in the past. It was... It was my fault. I'm... Being a ninja means you risk death. It wasn't your responsibility alone. They died because I gave
a careless order! I wanted to become a chunin
and was thinking only of success. Say Naruto, will you report back
to the village alone? Huh? What about you? We must demonstrate to them that the military strength of
the Hidden Leaf remains intact. Then let me help! Someone must go back to report this! Please go! I'm counting on you, Naruto. Earth Style: Landslide Jutsu! Explode! If you are determined to spend
the rest of your life as a genin, so be it. However, I will not allow you
to slack off. Follow me.
I will beat my jutsu into you! Water Style: Water Barrier! Avalanche Formation! Shuriken... Shadow Clone Jutsu! A-An artificial leg?! Having trouble, old man? You sure made it difficult for us. Difficult? Difficult, you say?! You sacrificed your genin like
they were nothing. Is this your way of doing things?! If ordered to give your life, you obey. Isn't that what genin are supposed to do? Didn't you use two of your subordinates
as diversions? The two who stayed behind to
buy us time were the jonin. They did it so we genin could escape! What?! There isn't a single ninja
among the Hidden Leaf... who would sacrifice
the lives of genin! Y-You mean genin took out
so many of us? Unforgivable... It's absolutely unforgivable! Don't think for a moment that you will have a swift
and painless death! I'll cut your body up into little pieces. You've done enough to atone
for your comrades' death. Enough, Kosuke, become a jonin. But Third Hokage, I'm still... Otherwise, from now on
you'll only be assigned the light missions of a genin. As long as I'm alive, I won't let you go
to your death on a mission. If you are a Hidden Leaf ninja,
find your Will of Fire! Do not burn away your life senselessly. Second Hokage... Third Hokage... Did I also have a Will of Fire? Naruto... Why? I don't need to run away! What? Because I'm not gonna die
in a place like this. What are you saying? I'm gonna be the Hokage! And a guy who plans on
becoming the Hokage can't allow a comrade to die for him! You are so rash. Of course it hurts. Please try not to do this
ever again. I will not allow a comrade to
give his life for me! As long as I'm alive, I won't let you go to your death
on a mission. Make amends after
you come through alive. O-Old man? I don't think I can die just yet. Hey! Are you two done? Behold, the Hidden Leaf Ninja! Huh? I won't allow the Hidden Leaf to be
destroyed by the likes of you! Just die, old man! I will not! Earth Style: Earth Dragon! Water Style: Water Dragon! Naruto... Yes? Like father, like son. How true. I'm gonna be the Hokage! We have to go back for
Captain Hayama and Tekuno. Right! And the enemy ninja attacked! And I turned to the hero who saved
the Leaf Village and shouted, "Go! Leave them to me!" Sounds like a pretty tall tale to me. Captain Hayama! Say something. Yeah, sure. Jeez! You left behind a fine son,
Fourth Hokage. Hey, did you see that Sakura?

 That woman walking with Kakashi
was beautiful!

 Could she be Kakashi's...

 So you're interested too, eh?

 Idiot! It's not like that.

 Stop acting like you're not.

 Hey guys! They're going.
So what are we going to do?

 Isn't it obvious?
We'll secretly follow them!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kakashi Love Song"


 This is big news! Tune in again!

 People of the Leaf Village. I am here to offer you a moment's respite
with some song and dance. Hanare... - Leaf's History -
Kakashi Love Song



 Hey. Good job on
another mission. Now I can finally
eat Ichiraku ramen! Sounds good.
You're treating, Naruto. Huh? Oh, fine already.
But you know... How about you treating us
for a change, Sasuke? I'm off to train. Then, maybe Kakashi Sensei can... Huh? Wow... She's beautiful. Was she arrested? I'm told she's a kunoichi who
disguised herself as a street performer to gather information
about the Land of Fire. What's going to happen
to her now? Well, she'll be interrogated to
see just what she found out. They'll use whatever
means necessary. Until she starts talking. Welcome. To the "Honesty Room." She is well trained to be able to
resist your interrogation. Not even a single moan, sir. Only the sound of
her gritting her teeth. What an impressive kunoichi. Well then... We'll have to reach into
that silence and find her inner voice. I understand. Then please summon Inoichi. They look...like clouds. Just like the ones
from that day. We're done with the pain. Time for a more
humane approach. Hanare... Infiltrate the Land of Fire and investigate
the state of affairs in the Hidden Leaf. The Hidden Leaf Village? Our nation has survived through the years
not with military might, but espionage. We use the information we gather to
plan strategies and gain the advantage in diplomatic negotiations with
other nations to avert conflict. The fate of our nation rests
in your hands, Hanare. Yes sir!
I will not fail you. What's that? That headband... It belongs to the Hidden Lock Village
in the Land of Key. She was captured before
she had infiltrated the Hidden Leaf. She didn't learn anything
of importance. Sorry, but now it's my turn to get
some information about your village. What's going on? She has no memories
about her village at all. Was it my imagination? What? Memories of me as a kid? Yeah, do you remember anything? No, I've never met her. I see. Did you learn anything else? Nothing significant. And she had no memory
regarding the Lock Village. She probably purged it. Purged? But, something is bothering me.
Just something... Part of it is the fact that
she had memories of you. But she's hiding something. Something that even I can't dig up. And that, Kakashi, is what
I want you to find out. Huh? Me? But I'm not a member of
the Intel Division. With your Sharingan, you may be able to see
further into her psyche. Are you a fool? You're showing me around the very village
I infiltrated for espionage. You won't find anything different here
than in any other village. And besides, I thought you could use
some air after being in that stuffy place. Which flower should I choose? What? Uh-huh... Uh-huh... What? No way! What?! Kakashi Sensei?! Kakashi? Are you curious too? It's not like that. It's that lady! You know,
the one we saw at the gate. The one accused of being a spy. Oh yeah! That pretty lady! What's Kakashi doing with
someone like her? Hey! Come over here. It's not like I'm trying to
draw out information from you. I was just asked to spend
the day with you. Once the day is done,
so is my duty. What will happen to me? Who knows? That cloud resembles Naruto. And next to that is...
Sasuke maybe? I see...my mother and father,
who gave me life. Although I never met them. When things got hard, when I was sad,
I always looked up at the clouds. I'd stare at the clouds
and imagine. Life in the village... And my parents who
supposedly live there. Otherwise,
I couldn't have endured. Not knowing who my parents were,
and not knowing about my village. Or my fate of being born simply
to become a spy. I can't hear them. But they seem suited
for each other. How silly. I'm going to get closer. I don't know my village. I was raised outside the village, so that I couldn't divulge any information
in case I was captured. And to this day, I risked my life
to carry out missions for a homeland
I've never even seen. That's why it meant everything... To have a home.
To have people who would accept me. Why tell me? You've remained silent
all this time. That's because... you taught me. I knew the moment I saw you. That you were the boy
from back then. I wanted to see my parents
and I set out for the village. But I got lost and
was feeling helpless. You told me to look up at the clouds
whenever I'm feeling lonely. Because clouds change their form
so you can envision the things you wish for. You said as long as you have hope,
the clouds will always answer your call. I always searched for
your likeness in the clouds. So I recognized you immediately,
even though you've changed quite a bit. Because you've always
been in my heart. You were my hope. Whoa... Things are
starting to heat up. Wait, Naruto! You'll... Hey, you three! Huh?! Uh...
You see, this is... Give me that!
Give me that! C-Congratulations! Huh? Thank you. The Lock Village has captured Riichi,
one of our jonin. The Lock Village? You mean the village where
that kunoichi is from? Yes... And the other side has proposed
to exchange Riichi for Hanare. Fortunately, it seems Hanare
holds very little information about the Land of Fire and
the Leaf Village. So releasing her
would be harmless. No, you can't! I'm opposed to returning
Hanare to them! It's not a Transformation Jutsu. That is definitely Riichi. All right! One man from each side
will accompany their prisoner, and the exchange will be made
at the center of the bridge. Agreed? Agreed! Kakashi Sensei... I never thought it would
turn out like this. I won't let you go. Hanare! Bring back information on
the Hidden Leaf without fail! Retreat! It's begun! Old man, give up! Don't underestimate us Lock ninja. Once a key is locked,
not even death could open it! How did you know? That day... You were weaving a sign with your eye. Without realizing it, my Sharingan read
ahead of your sign and I learned your jutsu. With that jutsu, I was able to
see inside my own brain. Your right eye does not look
at the outside world. That eye sees your inner world,
inside your own brain and it can look deep into the thoughts
of anyone who infiltrates your mind. You purposely let yourself be captured
and lured your interrogator into your brain. And you were secretly
gathering information from the interrogator's mind
without him knowing it. Every bit of knowledge that Inoichi
had about the Leaf Village. And you would take the information
with you during the prisoner exchange. At first,
I was opposed to the swap. But I wanted to rescue Riichi. So we planned to recapture you
immediately after the prisoner exchange. That wasn't necessary. The information I stole...
has already been deleted from my brain. You expect me to believe you? See for yourself with that eye. It's what I wish,
so I know you will believe me. Hanare... The Leaf Village was just like what I had
imagined of the home I have yet to see. As I walked with you
through the village, I felt so at home, even though
it was my first time there. When Naruto and his friends
gave us their blessing, I felt like I was accepted
in to the village. I truly believed so. And...that's why I can't
betray my home. You... Even if I go back now, I'll probably be charged for erasing
the information I had, and be executed. If that is the case, then I choose
to die at your hands! I'll be able to die believing,
for the first time in my life, I was able to do something good
for my home. For my birthplace... I cannot kill someone who
has lost her pride as a ninja. A ninja never allows their emotions
to get in the way of the mission. I wanted to fight you as
a ninja until the end. So that's your answer. Go. Kakashi Sensei! Where's Hanare? I guess she felt cornered
and gave up. She jumped off the cliff. An admirable ninja. - No...
- Are you okay with this, Kakashi Sensei?! What if that lady
really did love you? Enough! It's pointless. Hey, Neji! Can you help us out
with our interview?

 We want to make a newspaper
about Naruto's achievements!

 Sorry, but ask someone else.

 That's mean of you, Neji.

 All the younger students are
looking forward to this!

 Please!

 Oh, fine. Then let me tell you
a very special story.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Neji Chronicles"




 Now listen very carefully...




 Tune in again!

 Thank you, Lady Hinata. I appreciate you treating my wound
when you're injured as well. It's all right. Someone has already tended
to my wounds. The village is
short-handed right now. Sakura is so busy.
This is the least I can do. Neji! Can we interview you? Interview? Naruto played a huge part
in this battle, right? And the younger kids at the Academy
asked us to do a spread in the Academy newspaper
about his achievements. So we're going around
interviewing everyone. Sorry, but ask someone else. That's mean, Neji! I'll say! The kids at the Academy
are looking forward to it. Please! We're beggin' you! Oh, fine. Then let me tell you
a very special story. - Leaf's History -
Neji Chronicles


 It was roughly three years ago. The day the final round of
the Chunin Exam took place. Our first Chunin Exam that year
was met with many troubles. Feudal Lords and guests from
other nations all gathered to watch the final round in the Hidden
Leaf Village, and in the midst of that, we received reports that a Rogue Ninja
named Orochimaru was after Sasuke. The village took steps for
every contingency in every area and security was
extremely tight. During the finals, the Hidden Sand
and Hidden Sound conspired to destroy the Hidden Leaf. Something no one could
ever have predicted. Not yet knowing what was about to occur,
the matches continued, and spectators from various nations
watched with intense interest. Around that time, I was being
treated in the medical room, having lost to Naruto
during the first match. I came to see how you are.
How do you feel? I'm fine. Don't be disappointed. It's sheer luck that Naruto won!
I'm sure you'll win the next- Oh, I'm over that. Huh? Lord Hiashi came by
a little while ago. I had always believed that we members
of the branch family would never be truly free until the power of the Byakugan is sealed
away and our Curse Marks disappear. But it seems Father thought
of it differently. It's true that some things
cannot be changed. But perhaps, I have been making
blind assumptions about everything. Neji... Let's go back to the stadium. Guy Sensei and Lee are here and the Uchiha's match looks
really exciting. You're right. Then it happened. Orochimaru's destruction of
the Hidden Leaf had begun. What is that?! Have you noticed?
The cheering in the stadium has stopped. Yeah. Something in the air
is different. Byakugan! Due to the treachery
of Orochimaru's Hidden Sound and his allies from the Sand,
our village was thrown into chaos. How could this happen?! Fighting has broken out in
every corner of the village. Sand and Sound Ninja
against the Leaf. It's like... I know. It's like a war. We rushed to the stadium to
find out just what was going on. But unbeknownst to us, another incident
was already taking place. Is that... Elder! Hey, are you okay?! What happened to me? Kiba later told us that he was knocked
unconscious by enemy ninja disguised as Anbu Black Ops,
while watching over Lady Hinata, who had collapsed due to
injuries from her previous match. Hey... What the hell's
going on here? It seems you're all right. Elder's wound isn't fatal either. What happened here anyway? We were attacked.
Hinata has been taken. What?! Two ninja from the Hidden Cloud,
who were here as spectators, took her. No doubt they took advantage
of the commotion to take the Byakugan
out of the village. I tried to stop them, but... Neji, the Byakugan is a top-secret jutsu,
which your father protected with his life. It must not be stolen!
Go after them! Bring it back, whatever it takes! I understand. Wait, Neji!
I'm coming with you. This is a Hyuga matter. But it's too much for you
to handle alone. I'm coming too.
Hinata is my teammate. Besides, you don't think
highly of Hinata. There's no way you'd get serious
about saving her. Hey you! Then come with me.
Your nose will be useful. I guess having a three-man cell
would make things easier for pursuit. No, you're wrong. Including Akamaru, it's a four-man cell.
We're now a basic platoon. Let's go. I didn't know all that happened. Didn't the jonin in the stadium notice? Who knows? But they probably couldn't
spare the manpower. After all, the situation was
such that genin like Naruto had to be dispatched on
A-rank missions. What a shock having a war
suddenly break out like that. It's like a ninja alliance never existed. We can't let this opportunity go. The celebrated Kekkei Genkai, which is forbidden from being
taken out of the village. The Hidden Leaf's Byakugan. The enemy consists of two ninja. They intend to go straight
through the forest. The boundary we share with
the Land of Rice Paddies is up ahead. They're taking the shortest route
to Hidden Cloud Village. We're familiar with areas
within the Land of Fire, but not beyond the border. We have to settle this
before they get there. What's the matter? Akamaru can size up the enemy's strength
simply by sniffing their chakra. They seem to be quite formidable. They're probably higher
than chunin level. Our chances of victory are slim. But there are ways! Like surrounding them and
taking them by surprise. Hey stop! What is it? A trap? This place reeks of the enemy. What are they? How gross. It seems they laid a trap that is
activated by a pursuer's chakra. Here they come! There's no end to them. This is bad. Setting off the trap
may have alerted the enemy. Damn! We're running out of time! Then we only have one choice. Dragon Bomb! Go! I'll handle this. But... I can stop them for a while. You're going to get her back, right? Hurry! Okay! Well now... What weapons would
you like me to use? Come and get me! That's crazy!
All by herself? That's true. But Tenten is a skilled weapons specialist,
capable of mid to long-range attacks. She had the greatest chance of stopping
the enemy, then getting out of there. With time running out, we had no choice
but to have faith in her. Those damned Cloud Ninja...
Laying a nasty trap like that. However, setting up something
like that must've taken time. Yeah. The scent was still fresh. They're not that far ahead. Byakugan. I found them. All right! We'll ambush them
and get Hinata back! Forget it. That won't work. Then what do you suggest?! You can't stop me. I'm going! Someone set off the trap. Are they coming after us? Probably. Let's hurry. The boundary is straight up ahead. Right. Palm Heel Strike! You're not going to get your way. Don't try to resist.
We're in a hurry. As long as a head family member
wields the Byakugan, it doesn't matter whether
she's dead or alive, right? Damn brat! How about we just
take back her head instead? Tunneling Fang! Looks like I made it in time! Kiba?! Hinata! We're getting outta here! - A pursuer.
- Those brats... I'm gonna kill them! There's no way you could get away. You're absolutely right. Back then we just weren't
strong enough. It's useless for a mere genin like you. And we don't have time to waste! Gentle Fist... 8 Trigrams 64 Palms! 8 Trigrams 2 Palms! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! 64 Palms! I see. Now I get it. You're that Hyuga kid who was
in the Chunin Exam. That jerk. Acting all tough! So we were chasing a decoy. Move. We have no use for an eye
that loses its power upon death. I will not let you get past here. Earth Style: Mud Wave! I don't plan on letting
a Gentle Fist user come near me! Oh no! Earth Style Shadow Clone? He lured me. It's over. A taijutsu user who can't use
his arms or legs... is nothing more
than a caged bird. After hating them so much, you still end up being
a sacrifice for the head family. What a sad destiny for you. I didn't come reluctantly. I'm here because I chose to! Whatever. The result is the same.
You will die here! Mud Needle! Rotation! Sorry for being late. Lord Hiashi?! Hiashi?!
The head of the Hyuga Clan?! 8 Trigrams: Air Palm! Pathetic. Why are you here, Lord Hiashi? What about Lady Hinata? The Elder told me the details. Ko should be with Hinata now. With your friend that
he picked up along the way. I see. But why did you leave the battlefield
to come here of all places? Hinata is my precious daughter. And you are the precious memento
of my late brother. Thank goodness we're all okay. Say... Neji.
Sorry about everything. In time, the Cloud Ninja who planned
Lady Hinata's abduction were captured. It turned out that the Cloud Village
was not directly involved, so it didn't blow up into
an international incident and we settled things internally. And that's it. So behind the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf, there was an incident like that? I didn't know. That was a touching story. Good.
It was worth telling it to you. Hey, wait a minute! That's all there is to the story? But Naruto had nothing to do with this! What are you talking about? For me... I'm sorry, Neji.
All because of me... Please look up, Lady Hinata. There's no reason for you
to apologize. I thought I understood it all and bore
a grudge against the head family, without knowing the truth. I blamed fate and made myself believe
that I was the only one suffering. But during our battle, he told me that you were suffering
just as much as I was. And that you were trying so hard
to change in order to gain acceptance. I had never even thought about that. He made me see how selfish
and narrow-minded I was. Naruto did? Naruto Uzumaki.
He's an interesting guy. Yes! He was involved in
the most important part so don't worry. - What?!
- What?! I'm looking forward to your article. Hey Neji, no fair! You have to tell us what part
was important! It's all important. Every bit. Without him, this story may
never have happened. We wanted to hear about
Naruto's achievements. Then maybe asking me
was a mistake. W-Who the heck are you, Old man?!
You scared me!


 You're the one who scared me
with your loud scream!


 Hey, wait a minute.
What're you doing in my house?


 I don't know.
Before I knew it, I was standing here.


 "Before you knew it"?
What kind of stupid joke is...


 Mister?


 C-Could you take a look
at the mirror?!


 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Man Who Died Twice"


 G-G-Ghost!


 Tune in again!


 Shikamaru, are you in here? What is it? Ino needs you. What are you doing? Sorting photos. Sorting? What for? These photos were salvaged
from the disaster area. I'm sure there are some
important photos here, so we want to return them
to the owners. Look through them and
see if you recognize anyone. Sure! I can help with something like that. I don't know any of these people. This is... I remembered something I've gotta do! Huh? I'm taking this photo. - Hey, Naruto!
- I'm taking this photo. Oh, that's right. Do you know if tulips are
in bloom anywhere around here? Tulips? That's such a romantic flower, Naruto. In flower language,
tulips mean "eternal love." I don't like that look she's giving me. I think the flower garden on
the east side of the village is still intact. Thanks, Shikamaru! Sure. But why does he want tulips? Who knows? Eternal love, huh? Shucks! It's starting to rain. Better hurry back! Oww... W-What is that? Oh, it's a rock. What is this? A tag? Kisuke? I can't make out the rest. Oh no! I-I'd better get going. Sakura... S-Sakura... You're hugging me so hard. Sakura... You're heavy. Wh-Who are you, Mister?!
You gave me a scare! I'm the one who's scared...
with you screaming out like that! Hey Mister! You can't just
enter someone's home! Huh? I don't know.
I came to, and here I was. Huh? What do you mean you "came to"? That's ridiculous. A ghost! What?! Where?! There's nothing there! You're gonna give me
a heart attack! Mister... T-Take a look. Huh? Don't get too depressed. I guess it's hard not to. So, Mister, you don't remember dying? That's right! What is it? I don't remember anything. Wha-? In fact, I don't even remember
my name. I've never heard of a ghost
with amnesia! Same here. Did you do something that
would make me haunt you? Why would I?! I don't even know you! Why would I have
done something to you?! - Wait!
- What? Come to think of it,
last night... KISUKE

Back there in the hills
I peeled off a weird tag. Back there in the hills
I peeled off a weird tag. A tag? Hold it! And that turned me into a ghost? This is it! Kisuke? Am I Kisuke? Okay then, I guess Kisuke is my name.
But where am I from? How would I know? You're right. But if I'm dead, why can't I just
rest in peace? I heard that ghosts remain in
the real world because they have
lingering attachments. Lingering...attachments, huh? I wonder what kind of attachments? What am I supposed to do with him? - Leaf's History -
The Man Who Died Twice


 Looks like I'm the only one
who can see you. So only you, who broke the seal,
can see me. That means you're the only one
I can rely on, Naruto. Then I guess I'll just have to go out
and ask around! Kisuke? I don't know such a person. Never heard of him. I don't know him. Sheesh. No one knows you, Mister. So it didn't work. Hey, I know! You can't see him.
The Third Hokage isn't in. Did something happen? He's attending an important meeting. I figured Old Man Hokage
would know something. Well then, guess I'll try someone else. With this new security network, we'll be able to triple the strength
of the Hidden Leaf's defense system. Personally, I believe this measure
is absolutely necessary, and I recommend that you adopt it. I see. Well, this is
an excellent plan indeed. We will make the final decision
this afternoon. We'll take a recess now. Lady Koharu! Lord Homura! Oh, it's you, Sabiru. I appreciate your time today. That was a good proposal. You've come up in the world.
It's a testament to your hard work. Thank you for your kind words. My life is dedicated to this village. He's so young, yet he came up with
a new security plan for the village. I'm very impressed. If the measure is approved
during the afternoon session, it will solidify the peace in
Hidden Leaf Village. No luck. Will I ever get my memory back? Cheer up, Mister. Hey, Naruto! Sakura! You missed today's exercises. What are you dawdling around here for?! Oops, I completely forgot! That's no excuse! Oww... No, I'm in a real pinch. A real pinch? See! This...
Oh yeah, only I can see him. You're not making any sense! If you keep missing practice,
I'm going to tell on you to Sensei! Okay, I hear you. Jeez. Cripes, what'd I get myself into? I'm sorry, Naruto. Hey, wait, Sakura! What?! Do you know anyone named Kisuke
by any chance? Kisuke? I don't know anyone
by that name. Wait a second, I think I've heard
that name somewhere. - What?!
- What?! - Where?!
- Where?! I think... HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL When I went to the hospital
to visit someone, the patient in
the very back room... KISUKE MABOROSHI That's impossible. That's me. No wonder you can't
rest in peace, Mister. You're still alive. What happened to me anyway? Mister... Mister! Naruto... I got your address,
so let's go over there. Mister! Oh...okay. This is my house? A tulip. Your house burned down
quite a while ago. And I'm sorry to tell you this... but your wife died at the time. Mister? Mister! Are you all right? I remember now. That guy, he... sealed me away. That guy? Under orders from Anbu Black Ops, I was investigating the infiltration
of spies in Hidden Leaf Village. One man I came to suspect was Sabiru. Sabiru was an exceptional ninja in
the Tactical Division for Village Defense, and it was thought that he would
guide the Hidden Leaf to its future. I couldn't accuse him without
solid evidence. So I continued my investigation
without a word to anyone. And then... Come on out. Or did you think I hadn't noticed? It seems you're on to me,
but this cat-and-mouse game is over. So it is you! You won't get away! Wha-? What is this?! It's over. Damn it. Fooled you. You're not that strong. I hate to tell you this, but I got rid of your wife
just before coming here. What did you say?! Why you... If I seal your soul here, you will probably be found
having drowned. Suffering from the stress
of your assignment, you threw yourself and
your wife into the river. A husband-and-wife suicide.
That's the scenario. So long! Soul Detachment Jutsu. Sabiru intends to put
his security network into place in Hidden Leaf Village. Then he will have control of
the village's defense system. Whatever it takes,
he must be stopped. But how? Doctor, his temperature... His blood pressure isn't going back up! It's not working. Mister, what happened?! Step back, you're in our way! Just what happened here?! The life support system suddenly stopped. I'm not getting a heart rate! It's no use. No way... Mister, you can't die! Mister... Don't cry, Naruto! Mister! Someone turned off my life support
and killed me. What? The culprit is someone who
found me to be a threat. You mean, Sabiru? And now, we will vote on Sabiru's security network measure
for the Hidden Leaf Village. All those in favor of this plan,
raise your hands! By majority vote to adopt this measure- I oppose! Please wait on your decision! - Who are you?
- Kisuke? What do you mean you oppose? My name is Kisuke and I belong
to the Anbu Black Ops. I was on a secret mission to
investigate a spy who had infiltrated our village. And what does that have to do
with today's resolution? A whole lot, I tell you! Naruto, don't get too excited or
they'll see through your Transformation Jutsu. I know that. What I meant was,
it has much to do with it. Because the one under investigation
happens to be Sabiru! - What?
- Impossible! One moment please! Well then, Kisuke, where is the proof?! You sealed away my soul! This very body is the proof! That's...if you're the real Kisuke. I received a report that
Kisuke died a while earlier. Verify this! Yes sir. Is this the end? Damn it! What? This Kisuke is an imposter! Arrest him! I've lost sight of him. Just who are you?! Appearing before me like that... Are you helping Kisuke? That's unfortunate because
you're going to die too. So you did kill him
and his wife, after all. Who are you, brat? Isn't that so? And if I did? You won't get away with it! You were right about everything, Naruto. Release! Kakashi?! He happens to be one
of my subordinates. You're going to tell us all about
what you planned to do after taking control of
the Hidden Leaf defense system. It's over, Sabiru! Wait, Kakashi Sensei! Mister, take your own revenge! Yeah! - Transformation Jutsu!
- Transformation Jutsu! Sabiru! Prepare to die! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here we go! Sabiru! - Take this!
- Take this! What? Hey! No... Kakashi Sensei! He was taken out. Thank you, Naruto. Hidden Leaf Village was saved
because of you. I didn't do it. It was because you possessed me! No such thing. But Mister... Now you're a real ghost. That's okay. I'll find my wife in the other world
and live happily ever after. I have one favor to ask, Naruto. What is it? If you ever think about me,
can you place some tulips on our graves? It was my wife's favorite flower. Sure thing! Well, it's time to say goodbye, Naruto. Live life to the fullest
for our sake too. Mister! Yeah, I will, Kisuke! So long! What is this?!
Sasuke, what does this mean?

 How would I know?

 Besides, whose fault do you think it is
that we're in this situation?

 You're one to talk!
It's your fault Sakura's been captured!

 Shut it! While we argue like this,
Sakura's chance of survival only diminishes!

 We can't do anything by ourselves!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Worst Three-Legged Race"


 Nothing good comes
about when you're around.


 Tune in again!

 I'm coming in, Granny. This is from your daughter
and her husband. Oh my, thank you. Here's a letter for you. Hey, it's Kiba. I hear he volunteered to act as
a messenger for the people of the village. Those two are always together. You were too...back then. Huh? Remember? When you were
completely stuck to Sasuke. That's 'cuz we were both on Team 7.
So were you... I don't mean that. This was different.
You two were inseparable, literally. Now I remember! That's right. That's the time
we were on a mission to retrieve the treasure belonging to
the Feudal Lord's sister or whoever, which had been stolen by thieves. - Leaf's History -
The Worst Three-Legged Race According to our Intel,
the thieves who took the golden statue are either traveling on land
through this forest path or sailing by boat and will land here. We're going to split up into
two teams and lie in wait for them. In terms of balance, I guess I should go alone and
the three of you will be together. What do you mean by that? Are you saying Sasuke needs
all the help he can get? No, you're the hindrance. I'm not up to your level yet,
but surely 3 to 1 is too much. Why don't you take Naruto
off my hands? Subtract his skill from yours,
and we'll be even. Huh?! Sasuke, is that just
a clever approach so that you and I
can be alone together?! You've got to be kidding! Why would you subtract my skill?! Because you have nothing to add. What?! Sasuke wants to be with me so much,
he's getting impatient! You're just as irritating! Okay, pay attention. I'll watch the pier. And you three will keep an eye
on this path in the forest. If the thieves appear,
notify me immediately. Do not take them lightly. Our mission is to retrieve
the golden statue. We must proceed with utmost caution. If the thieves appear on my side,
I will send a signal with this. When this lightning barrel
is tossed into the air, it will release one thunderbolt. Once you verify it,
rush straight to that location. You better handle that with care. Now remember. You are not to act alone. It's the gang of thieves! Why you... Idiot! Careful with the treasure! I'm sorry, Boss Jako! Shape up! Yes sir! Treasure?! In that wicker box? This is...my chance! Amazing, Naruto! You showed up Sasuke real good! Don't tell me he's up to the same... I won't lose to him! W-What's this? Damn! The treasure! What are those two doing?! We have to notify
Kakashi Sensei first! What? There's another? Let go of the treasure! No way! Take this! I won't lose it. Huh? Damn it. Pursuers from
the Hidden Leaf, eh? Were those two
the only ones with you? There must be others. That's why you tried to get word out
about this location. Cool, huh? I'm a natural-born thief
who's rotten to the core. So as you can see,
even my chakra is foul. Those two escaped downriver. We'll split up and concentrate our search
along the river and we'll find them. And we'll take back the treasure. What about her? We might be able to use her
as a hostage. Bring her with us. I can't believe they stole
something stupid like this. The thunder... Huh? The thunderbolt to signal Kakashi
didn't go off, did it? No. Maybe Sakura couldn't release it. Sakura's been captured?! - Huh?
- Huh? Wha-? - Huh?
- Huh? - What is this?!
- What is this?! W-What's going on? We're stuck together. - Ready...pull!
- Ready...pull! Why is it always with you?! That's my line! Don't worry.
You'll see your friends soon. After they return the treasure I'll send you to the afterlife together. Even ninja are helpless
if their hands are bound. Sasuke... Naruto... Sakura... While we're stuck like this,
Sakura could be... You idiot, Naruto! Sakura... I'm coming to save you! Wait! You fool! What the hell are
you doing, Sasuke?! Don't you care what happens
to Sakura?! We will save Sakura! But we can't do anything if
our hands are like this. We're going to save her despite that.
It's what friends do! I...I don't want to be some scum who
doesn't give a damn about his friends! Those who abandon their friends
are worse than scum. Then joining up with Kakashi
is the right move to make! It will increase Sakura's chance
of survival! Don't talk about
her chance of survival! It just depends on how hard
we want to save her! We can't let Sakura die
over something this stupid! You idiot! Stop it, Naruto! Damn it... Damn it... Damn it... You know, a guy who doesn't take
his mission seriously is also scum. Gotta pee. What?! I said, I need to take a leak! Hey, what the hell?! Uh...well... Okay, one hand then. Cut it out! Not so close! What if you spray me too?! I don't care what you say.
If I gotta go, I gotta go. Hold it in! Can't. - Just let me finish, okay? Come on.
- Zip up, you idiot! You're in my way, Naruto! You're the one who's in my way! Give back the treasure! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Like you can weave a sign
with one hand! Didn't I tell you? At this rate,
we don't have a chance, even against guys much
weaker than us! Naruto...wait! I'm going. If you refuse... I'll cut off my arm, then go. I'm going to beat this guy
and save Sakura! You're so reckless! I'm going to save Sakura. Since the enemy came this far, we'll probably be found before
we catch up to Kakashi. If that's the case, it'll be faster if we make this guy tell us
where Sakura is and save her. Sasuke... Though it'll depend totally
on us working together. Right! Oh, I just remembered.
I gotta pee. Me too. What? Suguro hasn't come back? I wonder if he... You're wondering right. Yeah! Sasuke! Naruto! Huh? Free at last. Only a Feudal Lord's sister
could own a gold statute like that. It managed to pull us apart. Their hands are free now? You can have it in exchange for our partner. If you don't agree I'll pulverize every one of you,
now that my hands are free. Surely you don't think that
mere robbers can beat two ninja? How come you're gritting
your teeth so hard? Your veins are popping out
and you're sweating. If you're free, come over here. Come on! Their hands are still fused! There's nothing to fear! Get them! He called our bluff! Can't help it! Why you... Wha-?! - Naruto!
- Right! Oh no! Look out, you two! The treasure is mine! We can stop at least one of his hands. - Let's go!
- Right! Oh no, you don't! Fire Style! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What?! A seal? Even if we can weave signs together,
we can't mold chakra. Why you... Taking me for a fool! But we do have a combination attack! What?! Pachinko Jutsu! Well, I guess it can be
melted down and re-cast. Just maybe. Thank you, Sasuke! Hey, I did my best too. This is ridiculous! How come you, of all people,
can't undo this, Kakashi Sensei?! Remember, that boss said so too. It'll crumble apart in
two or three days. Like I can put up with him
for that long! That's my line. Uh-oh... I think I need to go. Not again. This time it's number two. You've got to be kidding. Don't you dare, Naruto! Aw c'mon, we already peed together. This is worse! "Those who abandon their friends
are worse than scum." These three overcome it so easily. Our mission is to defeat the bandits
who are after the village crops, and rescue the captive hostage. Their hideout is located in
a natural fortification, plus they have 3 forts. But the trickiest of all is
their leader Baji's intellect. Well, we have no choice but to do it. Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Team 10's Teamwork" I'm counting on you guys. Tune in again! Ino, Choji... Let's get this over with
and go home. We know. Right, Choji? Huh? Choji?! - That idiot!
- Cripes... - Ino, go with formation-
- I know! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! I'm counting on you, Ino. With the chakra I have now,
this is my limit. Here I go! Mind Transfer Jutsu! Looks like it worked. I figured as much. Super Expansion Jutsu! Hey Choji! How could you slack off?! This hunt was your idea
in the first place! Food is the foundation of survival. The village is in the midst of a crisis,
so we have to make sure we eat. Well, you're the only one
taking a break here! What if they got away? Huh? Well, I knew Shikamaru
could do this. Come to think of it... She also knew what to do
before I said anything. - Leaf's History -
Team 10's Teamwork


 They're demons. They appear every year
during the harvest. So this year, we were prepared
to die fighting them off. But that sly Baji... I don't know if he knew my plan or not,
but he kidnapped my granddaughter. This Baji is... He's the boss of the bandits
who steal our crops. Please... Please...save our village and
my granddaughter from those bandits! And you are? This is Tofu, a former member
of the bandits. An ex-bandit? I don't blame you
for mistrusting me. But I couldn't go along with
their ways anymore. Tofu here told me of
my granddaughter's abduction. As an ex-bandit,
he can be an invaluable guide. That's true. Please allow me to help. Well then,
let's get ready to move. - Yes, sir.
- Right! Shikamaru, got a minute? The hideout is
a natural fortification deep inside a cavern that
fans out like an ant's nest. There is only one route to it. But along this route are three forts
that each serve as a checking station. But the trickiest part is Baji's intelligence.
It's why he's so feared. The main purpose of this mission
is to rescue the hostage. And that will involve
a confrontation with the bandits. Shikamaru, what do you think? Well... He may still be a genin,
but he's a skilled tactician. There may only be one route,
but we're not moving a large force. Since it's just us,
maybe we can bypass the forts. Having said that, I'm sure they've set up their defenses
and laid considerable traps. But it's our best chance to get out
without fighting the enemy after we make the rescue. At the very least, we need to confirm
that there's a safe passage. I see. So the first thing to do is to find
a way for a small team to infiltrate. All right! Let's go! We genin are staying behind. What?! Like I just said, the enemy knows
every detour already. The only ones who are capable
of going undetected are Kakashi Sensei and Asuma. It's best to let them handle this. That's my opinion. He's right.
There's no other way, Kakashi. Yes. Don't be so upset, Naruto. Take care of things here, Shikamaru. I guess I'll have to. As you heard,
please wait here for a while. Huh? Hey, where's Tofu? Nature called. What's the big idea?! What was that shout?! Hey, look over there. Tofu! He's been captured?!
But how? Jeez... What'll we do?! Hey! Don't just sit there! The enemy is a gang of bandits
with scores of men. They have a hostage
and three forts. And beyond that,
the inner fortress. It'll be a pain,
but I guess we'll do it ourselves. Boss Baji! I brought the deserter! Good. You can go now. Yes sir! Oww... Welcome. Cripes...
Train your guys properly! Remember,
I'm a valuable informant. Sorry. They're trained to be suspicious
even if the password is correct. Well, you always take precautions. So you brought me information? The village hired ninja, after all. And? How strong are they? Two jonin and six genin. Two small teams made up
mostly of genin? Once we get rid of the jonin,
they won't be a problem at all. Yeah. And the two jonin aren't
with them right now. Really. Why's that? They're looking for a way to get here
without passing through the forts. That's what I'd do too. But if they don't anticipate traps
along the way, it'll be a mission of death. One of them saw that far ahead. He's a genin named Shikamaru.
He had that figured out already. So a two-man cell
made up of jonin bypasses our forts and
are on the alert for traps. As if a simple strategy like
that will work against me. Boss! B-Boss! It's a ninja! They managed to get through
our three forts! W-What?! Why was there no word
from the forts?! They just suddenly appeared. I don't know what's going on. Those three forts are there to
prevent just this sort of thing! It's impossible! You! Are you a double agent?! Don't tell me you're in cahoots with
the men at the forts and let these ninja... N-No way! I'm serious.
You've got to believe me! Talk is cheap. I-I know! Look, they think I've been captured! If you use me for
a hostage exchange, I'll be able to stall them and
send you information! Keeping you here
doesn't do any good. But if I use you for a hostage exchange,
I'll be able to crush their leader. The more cards to play, the better. All right!
Let's pulverize them all! - Slow down, Naruto.
- Huh? Don't forget that there's a hostage. Bringing down their hide-out
might not be that difficult, but we've got to find
the village headman's granddaughter first. O-Oh right. But how? We'll take advantage
of their next move. Next move? Which is a hostage exchange. That's plausible if
they don't want a confrontation. A hostage exchange? You mean one of us has
to become a hostage? Shikamaru! Come on out.
I want to talk to you! If you want to save him,
how about you take his place? Just as I expected. What's your answer, Shikamaru?! Okay. Fine! He answered my question. So far, it's going as I expected. What the-? My voice is gone?! My Hidden Jutsu: Muting Jutsu. If you can't speak, you can't convey
any strategy you come up with. I just have to have faith. What is he thinking? That idiot. Hey! Don't go off
on your own. Listen... Shikamaru would never
take action without a plan. He's right. Shikamaru said to take advantage
of this hostage exchange. But what did he mean by that? I'm sorry for the trouble I caused. You don't have to pretend. Huh? We were aware that you were a spy. A long time ago. If...If that's the case, why? Did you come to save me? How did you bypass the forts? Oh right,
you're still under my jutsu. Release! It's going to be all right now. I asked how you bypassed the forts! That was easy. We were suspicious
of Tofu all along. So we secretly placed
a mini-wireless on him. What? And as expected,
he said the password. The lilies on the mountain pass
shine at night. But I've never trusted passwords. And those guys at the forts
had strict orders. But it seems they're not
as suspicious as you are. We told them, "A spy who knows the password
should have come through before us." "We're pursuing him." And they let us pass. W-What? It was a childish prank,
but it worked nicely. You're no child,
I'll grant you that. Still, even if you're a smart little tactician,
you're just a prisoner right now. And I have my own strategy
to wipe out your genin pals. Don't be afraid. My friends will be here
soon to save us. Don't try to be brave. Ninjutsu may be powerful, but there's no way to destroy this place
without harming the hostage. That's the reason for
having a hostage. Wait! If you knew Tofu was my spy, why did you
agree to the hostage exchange?! Who knows? Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu! An assault? The loss of their leader throws
the genin into a panic and they attack the castle,
regardless of the hostages. Is that the diversionary tactic? But as long as there are hostages involved,
a full-on attack is impossible. And the other genin have
no jutsu to locate this spot. I hold the trump card.
There's no way you can win. Calm down! The boss planned for times like this! Right! This place is
a natural fortification! A large force cannot penetrate us! What is it? Boss! What is it? New ones!
More ninja just appeared! Quit panicking each time! Didn't I give you contingent plans
to handle something like that? B-But... It's an army of a thousand. A thousand?! Shikamaru's not here. So no one can stop me now! Shikamaru and the hostage
are in the west tower. So we make sure not to
destroy that one, right? You got it, Choji! Okay! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! Go Choji! You seem to be enjoying this. Huh? Do I? Aren't you scared? Nope. Why? Because I have faith in my friends. Don't get cocky, kid! I hold the trump card! I can get away with the hostage
as my shield! As long as I have
the headman's granddaughter, I can negotiate my way out. If I escape before the genin brats get here,
your plans won't mean a thing. You would abandon your men? My men? What a laugh! As long as I get out alive,
I can form a new gang anytime. - Shikamaru!
- Shikamaru! - Shikamaru!
- Are you all right? Yeah, but just barely. That's our line! You gave us such a scare! H-How did you find this place? The Yamanaka clan
of the Hidden Leaf use a Hidden Jutsu called
Mind Transfer Jutsu. I'm sure you've at least heard of it. Mind Transfer Jutsu?! Back there... Mind Transfer Jutsu! Through her Mind Transfer Jutsu,
Ino used my eyes to find this place. Release! Everyone, I know where Shikamaru
and the hostage are being held! So now you know. Don't be ridiculous! What would you have done if
I hadn't figured out your plan?! It was touch-and-go there for a while. That's crazy! Don't tell me you
knew from the start that I would call for a hostage exchange
with you for Tofu?! When a player loses a card,
he wants to replace it, right? A card? Well, in your case the card
was your three forts. Once you lost them, you needed to
replace them as quickly as possible. Through a hostage exchange. A tactician like you analyzes
every bit of data, and at the same time, places top priority
on his enemy's strategy. I knew right off the bat
that you'd target me. That's all. Amazing. Simply amazing. I lose.
I've got to hand it to you. I'm not amazing. What's amazing are my friends
who believe in me. Shut up! A Paper Bomb! Just try and make a move! I'll blow you all up! Did you hear?
If you make a move... My Shadow Possession Jutsu worked. My my... This year's rookies
are quite talented. We heard it all, Shikamaru. That was quite a risk you took taking action
without relaying your strategy to the others. Well, it ended successfully.
So job well done, Shikamaru. It wasn't a gamble. Besides I just watched my friends work
and had faith in them. That's all. Even without words,
I knew these guys would understand. When I think about it, Team 10 always
had each other's backs during battle. No, it wasn't just Team 10.
Naruto, Lee, Kiba, all of us. Our faith in our friends has spread past
our teams, and into the entire village. Right, Asuma? Oh well. Shall we go back
and have some barbeque? Yes! Hey, wait up! As punishment, you get to carry
the catch back to the village, Choji. Oh come on.
Help me out here. People may call me a tactician, but these guys know everything
there is about me. I have a mission for Team 7!

 Then again, it appears things are not
going well between Naruto and Sasuke.

 I'm embarrassed to say it,
but yes.

 It cannot be helped.

 You and Sasuke will handle
this mission.

 What shall I do with
Naruto and Sakura?

 Don't worry. I just happen to have
the perfect assignment for them.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Drive Towards Darkness"




 This is also for the mission!




 Tune in again!

 That's a pretty impressive structure
for such a remote place. I don't sense any ninja chakra
at all in this region. Are you going to check it out? No. We're headed for
Hidden Leaf Village. We don't have time to make stops. Naruto... How much stronger
are you going to get? Naruto! I'm not done yet. There was a raccoon dog in Mt. Senba. A hunter shot it with his rifle, and cooked it, and grilled it, then ate it. Now wrap it in leaves
and hide it... Oh! What are you doing?! You almost killed yourself! Hurry and pull me up! Just who do you think I am?! H-How dare you! I don't know who you are, but if you value your life,
be more careful. Y-You! What is your name? Sasuke... Sasuke Uchiha. Sasuke...Uchiha... - Leaf's History -
Drive Towards Darkness


 I have a mission for Team 7. We received word that ninja
on the National Wanted List have entered the Land of Fire. Your team is to learn what
their objective is and watch their movements. However... I take it that things aren't going well. No. Naruto has always been
the one trying to catch up to Sasuke. He wants Sasuke's approval
more than anyone else. Sasuke, on the other hand, has seen Naruto's abilities soar
and feels inferior. Being rivals can be difficult. It's like the relationship Jiraiya
and Orochimaru had. I guess I should let them
cool off a bit. So just you and Sasuke
will go on this mission. What about Naruto and Sakura? I just happen to have the perfect
babysitting assignment for those two. Babysitting? And so, you two will be going
on a bodyguard mission. You can count on us! So? Where is this person
we're supposed to protect? Oh, I didn't introduce you yet. This is Miss Naho. I'm Naho. - Huh?!
- Huh?! Then we're guarding... This young lady. What?! I thought we were gonna
be bodyguards for some VIP. What insolence, Shorty! You're shorter than I am! Naruto, be silent! Miss Naho is a relative
of the Feudal Lord. Lady Hokage... Are you going to tell me that
my bodyguards are... These two. I don't feel safe with these two. Get me Sasuke Uchiha. I'm very sorry, but Sasuke is away
on another mission. Let them go on that mission. Summon Sasuke here! I assure you, these two are
full-fledged Hidden Leaf ninja too. There's no need to worry. I am making a personal request. What's with her?
Going on and on about Sasuke. Maybe they're acquaintances? Okay, Naruto, Sakura! Lady Naho must go to Shizume Village
by today for a land inspection. On the double! Now! Stat! Accompany Lady Naho! If anything should happen to her,
I will personally... - R-Right.
- R-Right. Sasuke. We have no choice
since it's a mission. But make no mistake,
we'll get you there without fail. That doesn't make me
feel any safer. No! I refuse to go anywhere
unless it's with Sasuke! But you heard that Sasuke is
on another mission and won't return for some time. Then I'll wait until he does! Huh? What about the inspection? I don't need to go right now. Of course you do. Look, why does it have
to be Sasuke? Sasuke saved my life. If Sasuke had not been there,
I would have died. Besides that, he looked at me
as just another woman, not as a relative of the Feudal Lord. I doubt that. I trust Sasuke far more than you! In any case, I will not go
anywhere without Sasuke! Hey, what are we going to do? We have to accompany her
to Shizume Village by today. I know, but... If anything should happen to her,
I will personally... Naho, I will protect you without fail! Yes! There's no one as
trustworthy as you! Hey, act more like Sasuke, will you? Don't worry. Then stop doing things that
are out of his character! If Naho figures it out and
demands that we turn back, we'll be in big trouble. I know. Besides, she wouldn't know
how Sasuke usually acts. What are you two whispering about? Is it something
you don't want me to hear? Shut up and be quiet! Sasuke... Hey! Why are you talking in
such an angry manner? Well, isn't that how
Sasuke always talks? That aloof manner is enough
to melt a girl's heart. O-Oh yeah? Keep acting aloof! Cripes... Now that I think about it... Something seems to be
bothering Sasuke lately. Thank you, Sasuke. You saved me from the Sand,
didn't you, Sasuke? No. It was Naruto who saved you. I didn't feel safe with just
that stupid-looking one. Thank goodness you came, Sasuke. "Stupid-looking"? Is she talking about me?
Damn it! How come Sasuke is so popular?! Sasuke, is something wrong? Nothing's wrong! Something wrong? Nothing. I just felt a shiver
down my spine. Our mission is to track
the movement of wanted criminals. Don't let your guard down. Yeah. Are we getting close to Shizume Village? I think it's beyond this forest. We're almost there then. Sasuke... When she's asleep,
she's very cute. I guess Sasuke is her hero. Seems that way. There are so few of them. Looks like they've gone out. The question is, where? Is this an abduction plan? Says it will take place
near Shizume Village. The target is a young girl named Naho,
who is related to the Feudal Lord. This girl... Who are you guys? Naho, can I put you down for a while? What is happening? Step away!
Our business isn't with you. What? Target confirmed. Hand over that girl. Not to guys like you! That's right, Sasuke! Make mincemeat out of them! I intend to do just that. Sakura, take care of Naho. Right. Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! W-What?! Wow! So many Sasukes! Let's go! Sasuke Punch! Sasuke! You are so cool! Sasuke Kick! You're wonderful! Sasuke Chop! Chop! Chop! He's mesmerizing. Give me a break. Earth Style: Mudslide Jutsu! Don't worry! Here I go! U-zu-ma-ki! I mean... Lions Barrage! He did it! A jutsu like that is useless
against me! You're a stubborn one. Sasuke, beat him up! Naho, it's dangerous. Stay back! This time, I'll make sure
you can't get back up! Take this! Rasengan! How was that? Cool, huh? Naho! Sakura! Sasuke...help me. Naho! If you resist, this girl is dead. You... It didn't work. Your jutsu is still incomplete. What?! Oh? Sasuke! You're...not Sasuke? Sasuke, help! Sasuke! I followed the ninja's footprints,
but the scent becomes mixed here. They must have had a scuffle
with Naruto and Sakura. We just missed them. Why is Naruto involved
in this mission? Guarding the girl named Naho is
Naruto and Sakura's current assignment. What?! They're not here, so it must mean
they've been taken captive. This is bad. Summoning Jutsu! We don't have time. Sasuke, I'm leaving Pakkun with you. Let's split up and search! Understood. The girl is worth money, but shouldn't we have gotten rid
of the two ninja? We're up against ninja. Having more hostages won't hurt. Hey hey! You'll regret doing this to us! A ninja who cannot weave signs
is no threat to us. You just wait! Hey! Cut it out! Even if I can't weave signs... - Huh?!
- Huh?! Naho, run! Okay! Naho! I won't let you get away. Naughty girls must be punished. Sasuke... Help me, Sasuke! Sasuke... Sasuke... Sasuke... It's no use. No one is coming. Sasuke! Sasuke! Not bad. So you're the real one? Real one? That brat over there has
been impersonating you. He did what?! It's because you were late! Hey kid, we're here to help. Pakkun! This one fought pretty well.
Now, what about you? I'll show you! Right now! He's fast! Sasuke! Cut this off quickly! I'm doing my best. Aren't you done yet?! I'm working on it! You're awfully tough. That level of attack won't work on me. Then how about this? Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Sasuke! This just won't do it. Though I admit,
it makes me resistant to shock. My true form feels
much lighter. I don't believe it. This whole time, he coated
himself using Earth Style. So that's it! No wonder
my Rasengan didn't work either. Let's start over again. He disappeared?! You're not even moving. Not much of an opponent, are you? Sasuke! I'm coming! No! He's mine! Oh? Sharingan. You belong to the Uchiha clan? So you know the Sharingan? As ninja, my people wander
and work for various employers. In the last great war, we battled members
of the Uchiha clan too. By the way... I heard that one member named
Itachi Uchiha betrayed the Hidden Leaf
and killed his entire clan. So there was a survivor
among the Uchiha. Or could it be that you
weren't worth killing? There is no value in killing you now. I have no interest in you now. Taking Naruto is the supreme order
given to me by the Akatsuki. Shut up! Oh, I hit the nail on the head
and upset you, have I? That is why you are... ...a fool! What?! Sasuke, that's enough. Are you telling me what to do? Don't get carried away. Sasuke, you're scary. Spare me. Kakashi! Kakashi Sensei! You can stop now. We still have a lot of questions
to ask them. Hey... I'm going on back to
the village then. Sheesh. Sasuke... Sorry. He's got a lot on his mind right now. But he's actually a good guy. Forgive him, okay? Thanks. One day, when he's back
to his old self, I'll take you to see him. Sasuke... I promise. What do you mean,
"Danzo is the new Hokage"?!

 Plus, he gave permission
to dispose of Sasuke?!

 Sasuke is a Rogue Ninja.

 It was only Lady Tsunade's benevolence
that allowed us to settle this privately.

 I'm going to see Danzo!

 I'm coming too.

 Calm down, both of you!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Sixth Hokage Danzo"


 I can't stay calm!


 Tune in again!

 There's no mistake. It's a hideout that
Orochimaru once used. Leave it to Kabuto to
take advantage of an old nest. Hold it. They're on our side. Captain Mitarashi... I'm here to relay an order
from the village. Sai is to return home and
you are to continue tracking Kabuto. We are here to assist you. Yamato rushed back
in the midst of a mission. Did something happen? The Akatsuki attacked
the Hidden Leaf Village. The town has been destroyed, scores of citizens have been injured
and Lady Tsunade is in a coma. What?! As a result, Lord Danzo has
taken over as the Sixth Hokage. I can't believe such a thing
could happen so suddenly. I will give you a more detailed
account later, Captain. Sai... I'm on my way. Sai and I spent a lot of time
working together on this mission. But he remained aloof
up until the end. Lord Danzo is the Hokage? The essence of a ninja is to
operate behind the scenes. However, there are times when
a man who works in the shadows must step out into the open. For me, that time is now. I hope I have
your continued loyalty. - Yes sir!
- Yes sir! The Sixth Hokage Danzo


 What'll I do? Huh?! Well, the Hidden Leaf Village
has tons of pretty women. And what if all those women
declared their love for me? I was wondering what I'd do. Oh yes, I see. Well, why don't you
go out with them? With as many as you can
get your hands on! But...when the time comes
to leave the Hidden Leaf and they say they can't bear
to part with me, what'll I do? I'd be so scared if they suggest
something like a lover's suicide. So are you happy or scared?
What are you trying to say?! We haven't even reached
the Hidden Leaf Village yet. Don't get so carried away!
It's creepy! But maybe some handsome guy
with a super-good looking face might come on to you too. Why can't you just
say handsome guy? Although a rich, tall, famous ninja
in addition to being super-handsome wouldn't be farfetched. No, you're letting
your imagination run wild. No way that would happen!
Absolutely no way! I didn't ask... for your opinion! What would we do if that stone
hits a boulder and it crumbles and the falling rocks hit
another bigger boulder that causes an even bigger rockslide
that falls right over the Hidden Leaf Village
and destroys it? Who's over-imagining things now?!
Idiot! N-No way... It can't be! I didn't mean to do this!
I mean, how could a rock that size... K-Karui, what have you done? There's no way. Anyway, let's look for someone. Who are you three?! I'm Samui from the Hidden Cloud. I am a messenger for the Raikage,
the leader of the Hidden Cloud. Lord Raikage? Please pardon our run-in earlier. We're all on edge lately. There weren't any guards
from the Leaf around and finding the village
in such a state... We were shocked and
wondered what had happened. - It was the work of the Akatsuki.
- Here's your stone - Precautionary measures
- that destroyed the village. are being taken immediately
and security will be tightened. - We would like an audience
- That's got nothing to do with it! with your Hokage. I am here to deliver a letter
from the Raikage to Lady Hokage. Actually... Is something the matter? Oww! Don't tell me
this lump on my head... Enough! Talk about bad timing. A sealed tube never
contains any good news. It's a letter calling for an emergency
Five Kage Summit Conference. You see?
A Five Kage Summit Conference?! Lady Hokage is in a coma? I am her aide, so I will accept
the letter on her behalf. If it's uncertain when
she will regain consciousness, the interim Hokage will do. Someone must read the letter
and give me a reply! The Raikage cannot wait. But... That woman is
no longer the Hokage. I am the new Sixth Hokage. I will look at the letter. Don't tell me that Danzo has... What is it? Doesn't Lord Raikage
want a reply? OFFICIAL
TO THE HOKAGE
FROM THE RAIKAGE Sasuke...
So it has come to this. And your reply? Ow! Hey! What's wrong, Kiba? Now stay calm and listen! Lady Tsunade has been
relieved as the Hokage! - What?!
-Huh? It seems someone named Danzo
is the Sixth Hokage! I don't know too much, but apparently he's been
active behind the scenes! Danzo?! Danzo is... I have a bad feeling about this. And that's not
the only shocking thing! The Sixth Hokage declared
Sasuke as a Rogue Ninja, and has given the approval
to hunt him down! What the hell's going on?! Even I don't understand. They couldn't wait until
Lady Tsunade recovered. It makes sense in a way. Kakashi Sensei... Sasuke is indeed a Rogue Ninja. Normally, he would have
been eliminated long ago. It's only because of Lady Tsunade
that he's been allowed to live. I'm going to see this Danzo! Wait, Sakura! Storming into his office
will solve nothing. Lady Tsunade isn't even conscious yet!
How could they do this to her?! And what about Sasuke? You can't expect me
to keep quiet! I'm coming with you. Calm down, you two. At a time like this, staying calm is crucial or
things won't work out. How can I stay calm?! I won't let them lay
a hand on Sasuke! I said wait! Danzo has already figured out
that this is how you'll react. So you'll go see him, then what? I won't do anything violent! I just want to talk to him and ask him
to change his mind about Sasuke! I hardly think that he'll go along with
whatever you have to say. Jeez! Danzo has been appointed
by the Feudal Lord. While he has yet to win
a vote of confidence from the jonin, he is the Hokage. If you make a wrong move,
you'll be thrown into jail. That's fine with me! I'm going! Me too! H-Hey guys... Naruto, you possess
the Nine-Tails. What about it? Danzo would like nothing better
than to confine you in this village. Do you want to
be locked up in jail? That's exactly what he wants. Then you won't be
able to look for Sasuke. Don't make a scene right now. You wanted to see me? Keep an eye on Naruto. If you notice anything amiss,
inform me immediately. Yes sir. Umm... May I ask you a question? What is it? What do you plan
to do with Naruto? Do not worry. Naruto is the village hero
right now. Everyone trusts him. Even more than they trust me,
the Sixth Hokage. If I do anything to Naruto now, it will affect my appearance
as the Hokage. This is a crucial time,
right before the vote of confidence. Still, Naruto is a Jinchuriki. As the Hokage, I must keep the Jinchuriki
under surveillance. I cannot be lax like Tsunade was. I understand. You're excused. Should I be relieved? Sai! We were just looking for you! We need to talk to you. What is it? Tell us what you
know about Danzo. Sai! That's impossible. Why?! Don't tell me you're
working for him again! No... It's nothing like that. It's not possible for me to
say a word about Lord Danzo. Due to this. What the hell is that? Is it a Curse Mark? Yes, it's a Curse Mark
placed by Lord Danzo. If I start to talk about Lord Danzo, my entire body will become numb
and I won't be able to move or talk. This is true of all who
belong to the Foundation. He's a cautious man. Lord Danzo and the Foundation
engage in espionage. They've done a lot of dirty work
behind the scenes in order to protect the village. This cannot be revealed. So even if one is captured,
not a word will be uttered. But what a thing to do... Putting a Curse Mark on
one's own subordinate? I can't accept that. It's what has protected
Hidden Leaf Village from the bottom up. Their methods may have
been unscrupulous, but their love for the village
is no different from yours. Then why did he overturn
Lady Tsunade's decision about Sasuke? Isn't he planning to dispatch
Tracking Ninja to go after Sasuke? I-Is that so? I haven't heard anything
regarding Sasuke- You can tell us all about
this Sasuke fellow! You seem to be his friends! Shadow Clone Jutsu. Don't kill him! I know that! Sakura! Are you all right, Sakura? Judging from their headbands,
they're ninja from the Hidden Cloud. Why would they come here? What the hell do you guys want? You were just
talking about Sasuke! Tell us what you were saying! It's got nothing to do
with you Cloud Ninja! It's got everything to do with us! Sasuke Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf
attacked our village! Your Rogue Ninja
abducted our master! We don't even know if our master
is dead or alive, you idiots! Th-That's a lie! Why would Sasuke
do such a thing?! Like we'd know what
the Akatsuki's motives are! The Akatsuki?!
What do you mean? Huh?! Don't kid around! Sasuke is a member
of the Akatsuki! You guys let your
Rogue Ninja roam free, so Lord Raikage ordered us
to come here. And we've gotten your Hokage's
permission to get rid of the Uchiha! Sasuke...
abducted their master? We'll get our revenge! The Uchiha is ours! Sasuke... What's...happened to you? Hey, Sasuke. I suddenly sensed his chakra. What's going on? Aw man... Bad timing. How did you know where to find me? Don't underestimate me. I have considerable powers. So what do you
want with me now? Taka left the Akatsuki.
We're done with you. As it stands, you reneged
on your promise to me. What are you talking about? I'm talking about hunting
the Tailed Beast. We already caught the Eight-Tails
and delivered it to you. That was just a substitution. In other words, you guys failed. The Eight-Tails pulled
a fast one on you. I saw it all with my Sharingan. There's no way he had
an opportunity to make a clone. The only part of his body
that I cut off! Frankly,
I'm disappointed in you all. So what're you going to do? It's none of our business now. Wrong. You will finish whatever work you started
as members of the Akatsuki. Having said that,
you can forget about the Eight-Tails. I've decided to give you
a different task. And if I refuse? We'll fight it out right here. And you won't be able to
go to Hidden Leaf Village. We'll force our way through! It's a little too late to
go to the Hidden Leaf. I went right through him. Just like before.
Is this his power? Your purpose is fruitless.
Too bad. What do you mean? The Village Hidden in
the Leaves is no more. What are you saying?! I'll explain it to you. Who is he?! Relax. He's my partner. So, who is the new Hokage? Someone named Danzo. It's pretty much
what we expected. Danzo...is the Hokage? Yes, one of the high-ranking elders
of the Hidden Leaf who drove your elder brother
into a corner. He is the new Hokage. What the hell happened in
the Hidden Leaf Village?! My subordinate, Pain,
destroyed the Hidden Leaf. And because both you and Pain
were a bit too overbearing, it seems the five Kage
are going to take action. The five Kage? There will be
a Five Kage Summit Conference. I'll explain from here. You will tell us everything
you know about Sasuke. Of course,
his ninjutsu style and powers, but also any data
you have gathered about the Akatsuki and Sasuke's partners,
as well as their past actions. No way! It's a lie! Sasuke wouldn't join
the Akatsuki! Are you sure about this? Yes! The Uchiha family crest
was verified! And his facial composite
matched the list. That's... That's not poss... Why are you crying?!
We're the ones who want to cry! Your tears won't bring back
Lord Killer Bee or Lady Yugito! If you have time to cry,
then start talking about Sasuke! Wait, guys. Huh?! When the authorization to
terminate Sasuke was given, all Hidden Leaf data relating to him
should have been passed on to you. It's not necessary to
press these two any further. Oh, you're right! Our captain is now waiting for it. We were just trying to get whatever
other information was available! You can't expect us to stay still! We don't even know
how our master's doing! I will avenge Pervy Sage! I can't just sit around
doing nothing! You're not involved in this,
so you wouldn't understand how we feel! Is your master a Jinchuriki? How did you know? I'm a Jinchuriki too. The Akatsuki is after the Jinchuriki. So actually, I am involved. The Akatsuki will always
capture a Jinchuriki alive. That means your master
may not be dead. Are you serious?! Never mind Sasuke.
You need to save your master first. Are you really sure about this?! Really, really sure? Didn't I tell you?! Our master wouldn't die so easily! I'll help you rescue your master, and I'll give you whatever information
we have on the Akatsuki. Hey blondie,
you're quick to understand! Come with us and
tell us about Sasuke! Naruto... Leave it to me, Sakura. What's your name? Naruto Uzumaki. I can't do it.

 I can't sell Sasuke out.

 Quit playing around!

 You can't take it back now,
after all that's been done.

 I know I'm being selfish.

 But at this rate, the vicious cycle of
an eye for an eye will start all over again!

 Your Sasuke is the one
who started it all!

 So where do you suggest
we take our hatred?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Five Kage Summit's Eve"


 Naruto, why go this far for him?


 Tune in again!

 I'm a Jinchuriki too. The Akatsuki is after
the Jinchuriki. So actually, I am involved. The Akatsuki will always
capture a Jinchuriki alive. That means your master
may not be dead. Huh?! Are you serious?! Never mind Sasuke.
You need to save your master first. Are you really sure about this?! Really, really sure? Didn't I tell you?! Our master wouldn't die so easily! I'll help you rescue your master, and I'll give you whatever information
we have on the Akatsuki. Hey blondie,
you're quick to understand! Come with us and
tell us about Sasuke! Naruto... Leave it to me, Sakura. What's your name? Naruto? This Naruto guy defeated Pain
all by himself? That's right.
He's become extremely strong. I think he's stronger
than Sasuke right now. I don't care about that. My main concern is
this Five Kage Summit. What are we going to do? The Leaf Village is no more. And if this Danzo, our target, is going
to the Five Kage Summit, shouldn't we be heading there too? W-What? Am I wrong? We, Taka, will take the Hokage's head
at the Five Kage Summit. We're changing our destination. Sounds like a plan. So, where is this Five Kage Summit
taking place? This is becoming a really
bothersome situation. Zetsu! My clone will guide you. Okay, follow me! Can we trust them? We'll wait and see for now. If I sense anything suspicious, I'll get rid of them with
my Amaterasu. There's something I've been
meaning to test out anyway. All is going as planned. Not everything. Nagato's Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth
was supposed to be used for my benefit. I never expected he would use it
for something other than that. To betray me... Even if Sasuke should become
stronger than Nagato, it is meaningless if
he cannot be controlled. It will be awhile before I consider letting him
synchronize with the Gedo Statue. We need to keep an eye on him. So you had contingent plans
in case Nagato died? Somewhat. However, it's certainly not
what I had in mind. Naruto Uzumaki... He managed to put
a small dent in my plan. What next then?
Make our move? We're done moving ahead cautiously. Let us push forward
on "Project Tsuki no Me." Five Kage Summit's Eve

 This should do. All right, let's hear about Sasuke. Tell us what you know. Anything and everything about him. Well? Start talking! I can't do it. I can't sell Sasuke out. Quit playing around! You can't take it back now,
after all that's been done. Still, Sasuke is also a ninja
from the Hidden Leaf Village. He is a comrade! We would risk our lives to save him.
That's the Hidden Leaf way. Naruto... This is a once in
a lifetime request. Please...
Please bring Sasuke back. Well?! Say something! To be a ninja is to confront hatred. Each and every one of us
battles hatred. However, if there is justice
in vengeance, then justice will only breed
more vengeance. And trigger a cycle of hatred. I know I'm being selfish. But I can't sell out Sasuke. Why you... I understand your desire
for revenge. But if you let your hatred rule
and you kill Sasuke, this time, my comrades
may not put up with it! Eye for an eye! The vicious cycle will start
all over again! The people we want to protect
will kill each other off one after another! Your Sasuke is the one
who started it all! I don't give a damn what you say! We're going to kill Sasuke! Then where do you suggest
we take our hatred? How would you take responsibility
for that? Beat me up until your heart's content. That's about all I can offer... You sure know how to spit
convenient words, don't you?! Let's test your theory. See if it would really make me
feel better, huh?! How's that?! And that! And that! Take that! How far did they have to go
to gather intel? We're in foreign territory.
I hope they're not doing anything stupid. But all this damage
to Hidden Leaf Village... Who could've stopped
such a powerful foe? Taking on the Akatsuki all by himself... I never thought Naruto
would come this far. He's a true hero.
He deserves to become our Hokage. - Yeah!
- Definitely. That story is true. Apparently Sasuke Uchiha
had the Akatsuki robe on. I see. So Sasuke is really... Sakura, I'm sorry. I have Anko being followed by
Dajim and Tera, both skilled men. Perhaps now is the time
to dispose of her. This is a crucial time. I want to avoid any mishaps
that could worsen the situation. Increase our troops.
Get Kabuto before Anko does. That man might know about
my connection to Orochimaru. Kabuto has the research data
from Orochimaru's human experiments. We must get that data without fail. I'm certain it will be useful for
my right eye and left arm. Foo and Torune,
you two stay here. Terai, I'll rely on you to
deal with Kabuto. Now go! Yes sir! Now, I must leave for
the Five Kage Summit Conference. Except in special cases, we are only permitted to bring
a maximum of two retainers to the summit. You are the top two in the Foundation. I have decided that
you shall accompany me. Masks are forbidden.
Remove them. What level of arms are
we allowed for your protection? Do not concern yourself
with any limitations. I'll leave it to your judgment, Foo. Yes sir. Torune... Make sure your subordinates
watch Naruto. I doubt that Sai would do
anything to betray the Foundation. But it's a precaution. Yes sir. They are to make certain that the Nine-Tails does not
leave the village. You bastard. Let me make this clear! No amount of pummeling is going
to make me feel better! I won't stop until you start
talking about Sasuke! Don't interfere. He asked for this. Sai... Stay out of this. Naruto... You don't have to get beaten up
for Sasuke's sake. Shut up. It's my choice. I used to really hate Sasuke. But we ended up on the same team
and we had a great time. Sasuke is my friend. A precious bond that
I forged after so long. Sasuke...keeps hurting you
over and over again. If I were you... If you get in the way,
we'll beat you up too. Enough already, Karui. Beating them up won't
get us anywhere. You should know that. He promised to help us
rescue Lord Killer Bee. What?! Where's your usual skepticism
about promises being honored? This isn't like you at all! Naruto... No matter what we do,
he refuses to sell out his friend. He may be a foe,
but I like guys like him. A man shouldn't be loose with words. However much you thrash him,
he won't betray Sasuke. He's the type who means
what he says. Captain Samui. Omoi, Karui. How goes the intel-gathering? I hope you haven't gotten into trouble. Never mind that. We've learned that
Lord Killer Bee may be alive! Let's go and save him! First, we have to find
the Akatsuki hideout! And then what? Just the three of us will
take on a foe who managed to capture
Lord Killer Bee himself? Besides, we don't even know
how many hideouts the Akatsuki has. Where do we start? We need to gather intel,
and then analyze it. That comes first! We cannot repeat what happened
back then with Yugito. We'll take the intel we've gathered
directly to Lord Raikage! There is too much information
to sort out. T-Take me with you. I want to help you guys save
your Jinchuriki. Naruto! And I...have something I want to discuss
with the Raikage. Lord Raikage?
You've got to be kidding! Karui... So this child is Naruto. Naruto Uzumaki...the one everyone
in this village is talking about. We don't know enough about you. And with Lord Raikage on the road
under minimal guard, there's no way I can have you meet him. Karui, Omoi. Let's get going! We have permission to inspect the intel
on Sasuke and the Akatsuki. It'll take time to transfer the notes
and I need your help. Sai... What is it? Take me to Kakashi Sensei
and Captain Yamato. Okay. Here... I'm going to get the medicine box.
I'll be right back. What's...with that glum look? Kakashi Sensei. I see. Naruto did that, did he? Kakashi Sensei. What is so precious about
this bond with Sasuke that only hurts Naruto and Sakura? Why do those two keep putting up
with the pain it causes? Sai... You're assigned to keep
an eye on Naruto, right? W-Well that's... It's all right. I'm aware of it. Stepping in to save Naruto
isn't part of your duty. You've probably begun
to realize it too, Sai. You should let Sakura take
a look at that. No, it's okay. If she sees me like this,
it'll just cause more trouble. Besides, I heal fast. Sai... What you did earlier... Thanks. No problem. Boy, they really worked you over. Oww! Oh, I'm sorry. You'd better take some time
to recuperate. I'm going to see the Raikage! What are you saying?! The Five Kage Summit is
about to convene! It is agreed that every Hidden Village
will exercise restraint in leaving their lands and
conducting radical missions! What will you do by seeing him? I'm going to convince him
to forgive Sasuke! Right now, you don't even have
the necklace that seals the Tailed Beast! A Jinchuriki like you must not
leave the village! It was bad enough that as many as eight tails transformed
during that last battle! We were lucky that the Seal
activated in time to suppress the Nine-Tails,
but who knows about the next time? Besides, I'm in charge of
the village reconstruction. I cannot stay by you all the time! I met the Fourth Hokage. That last time,
it was the Fourth Hokage who stopped
my Nine-Tails transformation. W-What does he mean? The Fourth Hokage
passed away a long... There are still many mysteries to
the Sealing Jutsu, the Reaper Death Seal. He probably sealed his own
mental energy into the sealing spell. That's when the Fourth Hokage
told me... A guy wearing the Akatsuki mask instigated the Nine-Tails incident
16 years ago. And he was so strong, even the Fourth Hokage was
almost no match for him! On top of that, he said this guy
was the mastermind that was probably using Pain. If Sasuke has joined the Akatsuki,
then he's also being used. This is just what Lord Jiraiya feared. That incident 16 years ago... To think he was behind it. He possessed the Sharingan. He belonged to the Uchiha clan and
left the village harboring great hatred. And only he, Madara, is capable
of summoning the Nine-Tails. Anything is possible if it
involves Madara. So he's still alive. Madara... That vision and chakra more
ominous than mine... It's just like Madara Uchiha
from long ago. Who's Madara? A man who was defeated
by the First Hokage. The former leader of the Uchiha Clan
of Hidden Leaf Village. The higher-ups must be informed of this. Sai! Yes? Report this to the Hokage. R-Right. Naruto. What did the Fourth Hokage
say to you? Fathers like to tell their sons
all sorts of things, right? He said...he believed in me! Good! Naruto, you will go to the Raikage! Huh? With Yamato and I as your escorts. What?! This is a bad idea! What? Can't listen to what
I have to say, Tenzo? Hey! You're not supposed to call me
by that name, remember?! Now, now... Naruto, are you serious about
going to meet the Raikage?

 Of course. I'm going to ask him
to forgive Sasuke.

 That being said, without knowing
where the Raikage is...

 But you're good at stuff
like this, right?

 I'm counting on you!

 Huh? Jeez, you sure make it
sound so easy.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Enter the Five Kage!"


 Let's start the mission.


 Tune in again!

 You're late, Kankuro! Assembling my new puppets
took longer than I expected! Lord Kazekage, have a safe journey. Lord Kankuro, Lady Temari...
We're counting on you. We know. But Gaara doesn't really
need bodyguards. We're off. Gaara will be the youngest member
amongst the five Kage. Making sure the other Kage do not
take him lightly will also be our duty. A Five Kage Summit Conference... I wonder what the other Kage are like. Kurotsuchi, Akatsuchi,
we're counting on you two! Lord Tsuchikage! Show the other Kage
what you're made of! Having to go to summits
at my age is quite a chore. Look at those young ones
romping around. They don't even know what it's
like to have chronic back pain. Then maybe it's time to retire, Gramps. Why drag out the glory? Let me carry that pack for you,
Lord Tsuchikage! Hands off, Akatsuchi! I don't need your help! This is nothing. My back! Well? Want to send
someone else for you? Y-You idiot! Who do you think I am?! I am the Tsuchikage, once feared as Ohnoki the Fence Sitter
of the Hidden Stone! Enough!
I shall carry my own packs! Jeez... What a stubborn old geezer! Here, you can carry
your own pack if you wish. Now let's go! Of all the...
Do as you please! Just admit that's better, Gramps. Have a safe journey, Lord Tsuchikage! Guard Lady Mizukage well. Make sure Lady Mizukage
doesn't overdo things. I know. Thank you. Great Elder... I swear upon my title of Mizukage
to carry out my duties with brilliance. Chojuro, you are one of
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist. Protect our Mizukage well. Y-Yes sir. We should be fine...
I think. Have more confidence in yourself. You are strong. That is why I chose you to
accompany me to the summit. Okay, Chojuro? Yes, ma'am. I can handle it...I think. She's so kind. "Yes, ma'am" would be enough! Such an uncertain attitude
will get you nowhere! I swear, young people these days lack
the dedication to manage themselves. MANAGE MARRIAGE

Marriage? Ao! Enough with the lecturing! Get going or you'll be late! LATE...FOR MARRIAGE?!

Late...for marriage?! It's my way of offering advice!
Why, in my day... Shut up, or I'll kill you. Huh?! All right, Chojuro, Ao... Let us go! I will do everything to protect that
smile on our gentle Lady Mizukage! I hope I can. What are you doing, Ao? Lady Mizukage has left. Oh, no! Lady Mizukage, please wait for me! Still no word from Team Samui?! No, sir. But I do expect to
hear something soon. And Samui has already been given the route
you will take to the summit, Lord Raikage. She will either rendezvous with
you directly, or send a messenger bird. Good! Then I shall be off as well! Let us go! Shee! Darui! Yes, sir! Right. Follow me! Not again! Let's go, Darui. No... I'll just use the door. Go on, I'll catch up. "Enter the Five Kage!"

 Lord Danzo... I know. I haven't seen combat in a long time. This is the perfect opportunity
to loosen my muscles. Do not interfere. I will handle them! It hurts. It hurts. Is your target the Hokage,
or me personally? K-Kill me... Well, not that it matters. Seven, eight, nine, ten... Seventeen total, eh? Okay! I'm ready! It's not okay! Are you serious about going
to meet the Raikage? Yup. I'm going to ask him
to forgive Sasuke. But if you don't even know
where the Raikage is... So please help him out, Yamato. What?! See you. Kakashi... I'm here to challenge you! Brother Naruto! Huh? That voice... Please don't mention Naruto's actions
when you report to the Hokage. Tell him there's been no movement. It seems you still do not trust me. You work under Danzo and
your job is to keep an eye on Naruto. However, you are also
a member of my Team 7. So I do believe in you. He said...he believed in me! What is this feeling? Catch you later! These are remnants of the Hannya
Black Ops from the Land of Woods that we annihilated in the past. It's always been like this. Enemies looking for
the slightest opportunity to strike. Now that you've
come out of the shadows, things may become more
troublesome for you, sir. A ninja lives in an ascetic world. To remain anonymous was
a source of pride. But by exclusively controlling both
the surface and the underground, one can truly strengthen village
and nation. I will make certain that
this summit is a success and that I am recognized
as the Hokage. Then the Jonin Council will have no choice
but to accept me as their Hokage. My era has finally come. Hey... What's going on? I'm not sure.
What are those two up to? - Sexy Jutsu!
- Sexy Jutsu! You can spy on Naruto in your dreams. Did you want to watch their Sexy Jutsu? Sorry about that. But it seems Sai has begun
to lose the Foundation's trust. Oh... Look at the difference
in our sexiness! Now then... Damn it! I lose! I'm supposed to be your rival,
but you keep on kicking my butt, Bro! I heard the news. Huh? You brought down one of
the Pains with your Rasengan, right? I was just desperate that time. Good job, Konohamaru! You're a hero in our village too! You pick things up quicker
than I do! Next time, I'll teach you how
to do the Giant Rasengan! Okay! My hand hurts! What if I get tendonitis from this and
it causes my swordsmanship to deteriorate and I end up getting hurt in battle? And despite the frantic efforts
of the girls on the Medical Team, I die. Keep moving your hand,
not your tongue, will you?! We have to hurry up and consolidate
the data on Sasuke and the Akatsuki, or we'll be here forever! Umm... Could you please keep
your voices down? M-My apologies. LEAF ARCHIVES Finished at last! Cripes! Try to maintain your cool more
if you want to call yourselves ninja, got it?! We must hurry to Lord Raikage! - Gotcha!
- Right! Sorry, but I'm planting
Signal Seeds on you. I may not look it,
but tailing is my specialty. Now then... I should contact Kakashi
and Naruto. I wonder if that Naruto kid is okay. If you say another word,
I'll beat you up! It's been bugging you too, eh? I told you not to talk! Jeez! Your hands move
as quick as ever. Begin tailing. Right! INN Chojuro... Your Great Twin Sword Hiramekarei
must have been heavy during the journey. Are you all right? Oh...yes.
Although I feel a bit warm. Let me see. You do have a slight temperature. Lady Fifth,
you spoil Chojuro too much! This is why youth these days
get so full of themselves! Feeling feverish after
a short walk like that! In my day... Ao... We're no longer in the dark ages when
we were known as the Blood Mist Village. The nightmare under
the Fourth Mizukage is over. Please stop harping on
about the past. P-Pardon me, I just... Now, let us stop such depressing talk
and have some supper instead. I am looking forward to
the meal here. Oops! What's for dinner?
Something engaging, I hope. ENGAGING

Engaging? ENGAGEMENT!

Engagement! You did make arrangements
for dinner, didn't you, Chojuro? Th-There were so many choices,
in the end, I couldn't decide. In the end, it was... Such indecisiveness! Youth these days have no ambition
in their hearts! Only voids! VOID
Void?! I'm so sorry. I'll get on it right away! MY ENGAGEMENT
IN THE END, IT WAS...
VOID?!

My engagement...
in the end, it was...void?! Why, back in my day... Shut up, or I'll kill you. Why?! Man, it's getting cold. The Land of Iron is just
a stone's throw away. Wait, there's something up ahead. I've never been to the Land of Iron.
I'm so excited. There's nothing special about it. What's it like, Gramps? It lies among three mountains known
as the Three Wolves. It has its own culture, its own jurisdiction,
a powerful military and maintains neutrality. So it has its own culture and power. What makes it different from
the Land of Earth? There is a long-standing rule
that ninja will not meddle with it. The Land of Iron does not
rely on ninja. Instead, it is protected by those
who are known as samurai. How did it go? The security is real tight due
to the Five Kage Summit. Jugo, use animals to scout out
the route to the summit where the security is the thinnest. Okay. We have been awaiting your arrival,
Lord Kazekage. My name is Mifune,
a General of this Land of Iron. It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am the Kazekage, Gaara. It's cold. The climate is totally different
from the Land of Wind. Some hot tea will warm you up. Please come inside. It's gotten cold all of a sudden. We're in the middle of tailing!
So, shh! How is it? We can go up a route
on the west side. There aren't many guards. Karin, keep checking
the chakra positions of the guards. We're going to infiltrate now. I have to come too?! This is the time to demonstrate
your powers. Zetsu, was it? Yeah? I need you to confirm which
one is Danzo. You're coming too. A message from Sai, it seems. What is it? Just a routine report. Let's go. Why can't we just ambush him
before he arrives? I'm getting tired. Are you stupid?! If the Hokage is late, they're bound to
think something went wrong. Then samurai reinforcements
will swarm all over the place. And what if the other Kage come too? We don't know the enemy's strength. So we should wait for our chance
for a surprise attack on his way home. Right, Sasuke? Karin, just focus on
the enemy's chakra positions. Busted. Shut up! Sasuke, it seems you have
your hands full. Never mind that. I need you to verify which one
is Danzo before the meeting. You better not lie. I am attuned to chakra. There's always a disturbance
in chakra when one lies. So just remember,
I'll be checking on you all the time. I won't lie. Danzo is a hindrance to us too. Lord Raikage, it's Team Samui. Let's descend! I have returned from
the Hidden Leaf Village. And how did it go? Samui, you've been tailed. Come out,
you Hidden Leaf dogs! We need to talk! Lord Raikage, the incident in which
you tried to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan

 is still unresolved on our side.

 Please try not to forget
the sacrifices made by the Leaf.

 Right here and now, this young ninja,
no matter how awkwardly,

 is bowing his head in his affection
for the Cloud and Leaf, village and nation.

 Lord Raikage... As one of the five Kage,
what do you think of this?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's Plea"


 How foolish.


 Tune in again!



﻿1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,200
Sakura, do not fear... I'm here. You step back. Assault Blade. If you're going to defy me,
then I guess I have no choice. Will you join that kid as additions to my collection,
Grandma Chiyo...? Wh-What's that...? That's not Sasori's real body... I can kind of tell
that's not his real body. Yes...
That's...a puppet. But where's his real body? Puppet Masters are supposed to be
pulling the strings from behind, right? His real body's inside that. Inside? Puppet Masters have trouble
with close-range combat. After all, when controlling a puppet,
they are prone to openings ... That puppet there has basically
surmounted that problem. The puppet acts as a shield
as well as a weapon. It's Sasori's specialty, Hiruko. Lady Chiyo... About that puppet... I know a lot about it. Do you know how I make
my collection? First. I pull out the organs... Then after I've washed
the body nice and clean... I extract the blood. Once I've prepared the body
so it won't decay, I fill it with hidden weapons
and then... it becomes a complete addition
to my puppet collection. Just as the old woman said,
this form you see... Hiruko, is a part of my collection. And with the little girl and
Granny Chiyo added... I'll have exactly three hundred
in my collection. It's my art! <i>Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi!


</i> Gaara...! Is it okay for you to be taking me on? Kakashi Sensei of the Sharingan. I hate to say this, but... my man Sasori is stronger than I am... Probably... Our ideas of art are
quite different, though. Art, huh? Lady Chiyo? Back when he was
in the Hidden Sand, he was called a master craftsman... and he built many excellent puppets. But he devoted most of his energy into turning people into puppets
and collecting them. He calls that "art." And that puppet Hiruko... used to be a Shinobi
from another village. He was turned into that form
you see there by Sasori... He turned into a "human puppet" while still maintaining
his original human form. A human puppet. That's what'll happen to you
very soon. You'll become one of
my works of art. Hiruko is a puppet with
a great attack and defense. Be that as it may, first we need
to extract Sasori out of Hiruko. Then, how do we do that? The most frightening thing about
a puppet is their hidden weapon. If we can't figure out what they are, we won't be able to tell where
and how he'll attack. But Lady Chiyo, you know a lot about the mechanisms
of that puppet... We've got the edge. Yes... That's why I thought I could
take him on by myself at first. At first? But...it doesn't look like it'll work. What do you mean? It has a different form than
the Hiruko puppet I used to know. First of all, he didn't have
a shell like that on his back. He probably has a better ability
to guard now. And it's the first time
I've seen that left arm. In which case, his most important
hidden weapon mechanism might also have been improved. What do we do? In order to defeat Sasori, first we must destroy that Hiruko. However, I don't have that kind
of destructive power. But Sakura... You do. That incredible strength
Princess Tsunade... personally taught you. Okay! Listen carefully, Sakura. First, get close to him... and smash the puppet with
your incredible strength. However, you must dodge all
of his hidden device attacks. All of them, perfectly! You must not even get a scratch. Poison, right...? That's right... Even a scratch
can turn into a fatal wound. <i>Here I go.</i> <i>Hold him down!</i> <i>Right!</i> In order to dodge his attacks,
you must figure out the tricks to the hidden weapons of
the master craftsman's puppet. And you must also be able
to immediately assess how to dodge his attacks. I don't think I can do either at all... Indeed... In order to do that, a lot of actual battle experience
is required. Then...how can I...? What do I look like to you? Do I just look like
an unreliable old bag...? Or... Leave it to me... That's why I'm here! I have much more actual
battle experience than he does. And he knows that. That's why he doesn't attempt
to attack carelessly. This man who so hates
waiting for people, and being kept waiting by them... And besides... I made the first move. Sakura. Lend me your ears. You and I... will defeat him! <i>What're they planning?</i> <i>From here, I can't make out
what they're saying...</i> Understood. I'll give it a try. Are you about ready? You know I hate to
be kept waiting, don't you? Rest easy. We'll... ...put an end to this soon. It looks like they've started. Is just that little girl...
and that old bag... really up to the task of taking
on my man Sasori? <i>So he wants to fight Naruto
one-on-one if he can, huh?</i> <i>He's a Shinobi who defeated...</i> <i>the Kazekage,
one of the five great Kage.</i> <i>Naruto probably wouldn't be
a match for him alone.</i> You go to Sakura, Sensei. I'll save...Gaara! It wouldn't be worthwhile if
you were beaten that easily. I won't let you...
have Gaara, no matter what! <i>They're seeing through it...huh?</i> <i>If so...</i> Die! <i>They completely dodged
my attack just now?</i> <i>I understand Grandma Chiyo
being able to.</i> <i>But that little girl...</i> <i>How?!</i> <i>Grandma Chiyo's...</i> <i>not moving...?</i> <i>I'm being mocked...</i> <i>I can't believe she's charging at me
head on without any backup...</i> <i>It won't move!</i> <i>I get it! Grandma...!</i> Now, Sakura! Smash him! Right! I'm taking back Gaara! You're sure a weird Jinchuriki. I'd heard that Jinchuriki were
gloomy misanthropes. Not counting this guy, my comrades have
defeated two Jinchuriki. It seems not even
one comrade or villager attempted to save them. In fact, it seems there were actually
some people who were glad... So you couldn't forsake someone
pitiful and hated like you? Gaara... Gaara died after
the One-Tail was extracted. That will soon happen to you...too! I won't...forgive you jerks! So you've finally come out, huh? That's his real body! I've come this far to see
my grandson's face. After twenty years,
what say we face each other? Now we're down to
the final question. "Whatever Kind of Job
in the World Quiz," the last guest is this person! Hey, this guy's covered
in a cape from head to toe! I got it! A famous actor, right? Then, a muscular carpenter! A job that has uniforms? - Give us a hint!
- No hint whatsoever! I don't get it! Time is running out! H-Hold on! Too bad guys! Now, let's have
the guest to take off the cape. Next time:
Sasori's Real Face You actually tailed Samui.
You guys are pretty good. Y-You... You're Naruto! You tailed us! What's the big idea?! Boss, the one on the right...
is Kakashi Hatake. I know that! Did the Hokage send you,
Kakashi Hatake? No, I came to ask you personally about a request by Naruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf. Naruto Uzumaki? If you could hear him out
for just a while. Isn't this a bit rude? Stopping us en route to the summit
without any prior notice. I am fully aware of that. No matter. You there, boy! Speak! Sasuke... I want you to cancel
the disposal of Sasuke Uchiha! H-Hey, this isn't really the place... Are you still talking about that?! You sure got guts. What are you saying? I know it sounds ridiculous! But this is the only way
I know how to say it! Sasuke is my friend! My friend's gonna get killed. I can't just stand by and
let it happen! On top of that,
I don't want Sasuke to be the cause of the Leaf and
Cloud Villages killing each other. I don't want my friends,
or the Cloud to fight for revenge! I'm begging you! I don't want us killing each other
out of vengeance anymore! All Sasuke ever thought
about was revenge! He became obsessed with it
and that changed him. Vengeance makes you go mad. It turns you into someone
you don't recognize anymore. I don't want anyone else
to become like Sasuke! I don't want the Leaf and Cloud Villages
to destroy each other! That's why... I have work to do,
so I'm going on ahead. Please report to Kakashi Sensei
about the mission. Sure! You can count on me. See you. Say Naruto... You like Sakura, don't you? What?! It was in a book. When you're with someone you like,
you always smile. You're like that. Did you tell her how you feel? How could I? I'm a guy who couldn't even
keep my promise to her. Sai... Stay out of this. No. I can't just sit still either, Naruto. We will dispose of Sasuke! After that, you can stop the cycle. What a fool. We are in a hurry.
We've let you have your say. Lord Raikage... The incident in which you tried
to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan is still unresolved on our side. The Hidden Leaf swallowed
tears of blood and avoided fighting the Cloud,
who fueled the fires of war. It's thanks to those noble sacrifices
that your people still exist. Please try not to forget that. Right here and now,
this young ninja, no matter how awkwardly,
is bowing his head in his affection for the Cloud and Leaf,
village and nation. Lord Raikage... As one of the five Kage,
what do you think of this? A ninja does not bow
his head so easily! A ninja values action and strength! Concessions are forbidden
in agreements made between ninja. The history of man is a history of war. Since the three Great Ninja Wars every nation, and every land
has tried to obtain powerful ninjutsu. Those without power are crushed. That is the truth of the ninja world. The Akatsuki will be branded
as wanted fugitives. Then, not only I, but the whole world
will hunt Sasuke down. Yet you bow your head
for this criminal and plead for mercy for your friend. In the ninja world,
that is not friendship! Boy from the Hidden Leaf,
think hard on what you must do! The ninja world does not indulge fools! Let's go! Naruto... Enough already. Raise your head. We have been waiting for you. He's the one.
The old one in the middle. So that's...Danzo! SAMURAI Please remove your Kage hats. LIGHTNING

 In response to Lord Raikage's request, WATER


In response to Lord Raikage's request, the five Kage have assembled here. EARTH


the five Kage have assembled here. the five Kage have assembled here. WIND FIRE I am Mifune, your moderator. The Five Kage Summit Conference
is called into order. Naruto's Plea

 I am Mifune, your moderator. The Five Kage Summit Conference
is called into order. I shall speak first. Hear me. There's such a difference
in Kage these days. To be a Kage at your age is quite an accomplishment,
Lord Kazekage. It seems your father trained you
extremely well, except in the area of proper etiquette. You're probably right. It is the reason why
I can be here as Kagekaze. You certainly are cocky. Lord Tsuchikage,
there's no need to make fun of him. Continue, Lord Kazekage. I am a former Jinchuriki. I was captured by the Akatsuki, - they took my Tailed Beast
-The nerve of that Tsuchikage! - and nearly killed me.
-Quiet! So I consider the Akatsuki
extremely dangerous. I sought the cooperation of
the five Kage many times, but was ignored. Except by the previous Hokage. At a time when various lands
have had their Jinchuriki stolen the response by this group
has been far too slow! How can the Hidden Villages of
the Five Great Nations serve as an example when they allow
their Jinchuriki to be taken? It is an embarrassment! It is common sense to resolve this
in utmost secrecy. Seeking the help of other lands
just because of that is nonsense! Saving face... Prestige... Such old-fashioned beliefs. Such a brat. Old-fashioned beliefs aside... I will acknowledge that as
the Mizukage, I have delayed action. However, having our Tailed Beast
stolen is no cause for immediate fear. Controlling a Tailed Beast requires
skill, knowledge and time. The Jinchuriki and the Tailed Beast
must mature together and adapt to each other. And still, controlling
the Tailed Beast is difficult. It is not a simple task. Isn't that so, Lord Kazekage? The only ones who were capable
of controlling a Tailed Beast were Madara Uchiha and
the First Hokage, Senju Hashirama. Also Fourth Mizukage Yagura, and Lord Raikage's younger brother,
Killer Bee. However... - Chojuro!
- Right! Enough... of this! This is a place of discussion. Please refrain from disruptive actions. Stand down, Foo, Torune. You too, Kankuro, Temari. Ao, Chojuro. I'm fine. Yes, ma'am. Let us continue our discussion. The Hidden Leaf, Rock, Sand and Mist... Rogue Ninja from your villages
make up the Akatsuki! And that is not all! From our investigations,
we know that among you, including your previous Kage,
there are those who used the Akatsuki! Used them?! I do not trust you! I had no intention of even
discussing this with you. But the reason I convened this summit is to question your loyalty! What do you mean, "used" the Akatsuki? You are the Kazekage,
yet you have not been informed? Ask the elders back home! You used the Akatsuki in the past war! The Great Nations are heading
towards uniform stability. They are moving from military expansion
to military disarmament. As fear and the threat of war
diminishes between nations, Hidden Villages, which are
the source of its military strength, become costly hindrances. And yet, carelessly downsizing
the villages poses a risk. What if war suddenly breaks out? It would be a problem to
depend on ninja who have no experience in war. It would mean certain defeat! And one way to reduce that risk is
mercenary soldiers. Namely, the Akatsuki? It takes effort and money to train
skilled ninja from your own village. But the Akatsuki,
which makes war its livelihood, is made up of experienced professionals. Furthermore, they can be hired
for cheap. Best of all,
they return exceptional results. Get serious, Tsuchikage! The Sand used the Akatsuki
to destroy the Hidden Leaf. I'm speaking of Orochimaru! It is not clear if he had broken away
from the Akatsuki or not. But as a result, your father,
the Fourth Kazekage, and the Third Hokage Hiruzen, died. And frankly, it's hard not to
rule out the idea that this was someone's scheme. The old fox. The most suspicious is the Hidden Mist! You Mist do not conduct diplomacy. There are even rumors that
the Akatsuki originated there! Since we have come this far
I will speak honestly. Is Lady Fifth going to reveal... There were suspicions that someone was manipulating Yagura,
our Fourth Mizukage. And there was a possibility that
it was the Akatsuki. No one wanted this to
get blown out of proportion. Each and every one of you... Hold your tongue, Raikage! Ultimately, it is because your village
disregarded the disarmament efforts and sought powerful ninjutsu. We had no choice but to counter
by hiring the Akatsuki! What?! Before we start arguing
about the situation, there is a statement
I have been waiting to make. What is it? The leader of the Akatsuki is... probably Madara Uchiha. Are you sure of that? Hasn't he been dead for several decades? He is right. He died long ago. I do not know the details. But the information is quite reliable. Are you saying he is immortal?! Perhaps. To think...that he was really a monster. I want to speak on behalf
of the neutral nations. The leader of the Akatsuki was
able to read the times well. Despite stabilization,
nations had private suspicions and the Akatsuki took advantage
of that weakness to amass its power. What are you trying to say?! Calm down. Turn calamity into good fortune. It is extremely rare for all
five Kage to assemble. What do you say? Until the Akatsuki is eliminated,
why not establish the world's first Allied Shinobi Forces
of the Five Hidden Villages? An allied force? That is a fine plan.
We are in an emergency state. Cooperation is crucial. It's going perfectly. Going forward, we must determine
a chain of command. We must avoid any further confusion. So? Who will we choose to
lead the allied forces? Leaving that to you five
will only result in arguments. So I ask that you respect
the position of the neutral nations and allow me to come up
with a proposal to decide who among you
five Kage is most suitable. This spells the end of Tsunade's era. Presently, only Hidden Leaf Village
has a Jinchuriki, the Nine-Tails. The key is how to utilize it. How about granting
the supreme authority of the Allied Shinobi Forces
to the Hokage? Why did it turn out like this?!

 Don't cry, Ino!

 Kiba, don't be so harsh.

 You know how Ino has felt
about Sasuke all these...

 It can't be helped!

 Things have changed since then.

 Will they be okay?

 Look at Ino.
How will Naruto and Sakura take it?

 Let's leave it to Shikamaru.
He'll find the right words.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Painful Decision"


 Wait, Shikamaru! Tune in again!

 Huh? Where'd that guy go? Ready? Yeah. Then begin. Painful Decision

 If only Lady Tsunade would
come out of her coma, I know she would resolve
the situation with Sasuke. Sakura... Excuse me. Sai? I need to speak to you. Naruto did what?! Yes. In order to protect Sasuke. He was bruised and battered all over. You bastard. Still, he refused to sell out Sasuke. Not only that... In order to prevent you from worrying, he asked me to keep it quiet. Naruto... He's on his way to see the Raikage and ask him to forgive Sasuke. Why would he be so reckless?! Wasn't Kakashi with him?! It probably wouldn't have
made any difference. Kakashi Sensei has faith in Naruto. Even if it's a long shot, he probably wants to create
an opportunity for him. If Lady Tsunade were there,
she'd have done the same thing. Sakura... I was only recently assigned to
Team Kakashi to take Sasuke's place. So I still don't know
all of you that well. And I'm not good at understanding
a person's feelings. Also... What?! Did you tell her how you feel? How could I? I'm a guy who couldn't even
keep my promise to her. I don't know the promise made
between you and Naruto. Naruto...  This is a once
in a lifetime request. Please... Please bring Sasuke back. But... Even I can tell that
Naruto loves you! You care for Sasuke so much. And I know what
you're going through right now... so much so that it hurts. I swear I'll bring Sasuke back! I promise that on my life! Sakura! I'll keep my promise to you. I swear I'll keep it because I said so. I said so... I never go back on my word. That's my Ninja Way. Sakura... It's as though Naruto has
been shouldering the burden of his promise to you. As though he intends to bear
that burden for the rest of his life. I don't know what you told Naruto. But it's no different from
what was done to me. It's like a Curse Mark. Sasuke is the source of
Naruto's agony. But aren't you a part of it too? Ino... Don't cry, Ino! Kiba, don't be so harsh. You know how Ino has felt
about Sasuke all these... It can't be helped! Things have changed since then. Will they be okay? Look at Ino. How will Naruto and Sakura take it? Let's leave it to Shikamaru. He'll find the right words. Plus, there was that first mission of his
as a squad leader that failed, and he still feels somewhat
responsible for it. If only we had been able to take
Sasuke back that time. That's why he volunteered
to be the persuader. Wait! Naruto genuinely wants
to rescue Sasuke, not just because he promised
Sakura! Isn't that so? I totally agree with you. But...both Sakura and I... and everyone else rely on
Naruto too much. I've watched how Naruto
has been acting lately and I figured out what he's feeling. It's sadness. Then my thoughts turn to Sasuke...
and it starts to get warm inside my gut. I realize now that it's anger. Whether it's for Naruto's sake
or for the village, we can't just rely on Naruto. We have to take action ourselves. Sasuke is... Sai is absolutely right. Shikamaru... We're not kids anymore. We must stop the Akatsuki. And we must stop Sasuke. I came here for Team 7's consent. Consent? Don't tell me... Yes...exactly that. We can't allow war to break out
between the Hidden Leaf and the Hidden Cloud
because of Sasuke. Let me put it another way.
Listen carefully. If the Hidden Cloud should
kill Sasuke, there's no way Ino or you,
or Naruto, would take it quietly. And if through some act
of recklessness, Ino and you are killed by the Cloud... neither I, Choji, Inoichi nor
your parents would sit still. They would seek revenge. Then the other side won't
remain quiet. They'll want revenge. And if Choji and I are killed, then it will be our parents
who take action. And before we know it,
we'll be at war. According to the messenger
from the Cloud, Sasuke is already being treated
as a criminal on a national level. If Sasuke continues to align himself
with the Akatsuki and intensify the hatred throughout
the country, the Hidden Leaf must deal
with Sasuke. That is my belief. You understand where
I'm coming from, don't you? Sakura... That's why I need your consent. Sakura, will you... Shikamaru! Please don't... say anything more. Sorry, Sakura...
But whatever your answer is, I must act for the sake of
the Leaf's future. I intend to tell Naruto this too. Where is he? Naruto has gone to the Land of Iron. To meet with the Raikage. He's willing to go that far? I guess this isn't gonna be easy. I'll talk to Naruto. Sakura! He's foolish enough to like
someone like me. So let me handle this. I'm the one who made
Naruto suffer the most. I'm always messing up. One failure after another. I don't want to make
any more mistakes. I don't want to fail. That's why... Let the Hokage lead
the Allied Shinobi Forces?! If you all approve,
I will accept this appointment. Why the Hokage?! He is synonymous with
the dark side of ninja! We cannot let him take charge! Then whom would you suggest? Not one of the Akatsuki came
from my village! This important post requires trust!
I should be the one to... I cannot agree to that. What?! I am well aware that passion
and strength are essential in bringing the strong together. But someone like you, who lets his emotions rule
his use of power, would send the Allied Forces into
disarray like the top of that desk. I am simply making
an objective, rational observation as a representative of
a neutral nation. Lord Kazekage is much
too young to wield such power. He does not yet have
much pull with nations. His title of Kazekage alone
is inadequate. Lord Tsuchikage, on the other hand,
is too advanced in years and gives the impression of
one whose power has waned. And, he used the Akatsuki too much. He is lacking in trust the most. Lady Mizukage's Hidden Mist is said
to be the birthplace of the Akatsuki. There is the fear that inside information
will be leaked to them. That there are spies. We do not know why the Akatsuki
is gathering the Tailed Beasts or what they intend to do with them. But we cannot let them
have the Nine-Tails. The Nine-Tails belongs
to the Hidden Leaf. Hence, I believe that the Hokage
is the logical choice. First of all, I refuse to recognize
an Allied Shinobi Force that would compromise
the security of my village! Something about this
just doesn't feel right. I'd better check. Chojuro... Be prepared for battle. Huh? Byakugan! Th-This is... What's the meaning of this? That right shoulder and right arm... and the color of the right eye... There's no mistake. It's the color of Shisui Uchiha's eye! He was a formidable foe
that I fought against once. I'll never forget his color! Lord Hokage! I ask that you show us your right eye
underneath that bandage. What's going on? I believe you stole
Shisui Uchiha's eye and then transplanted it into
your right eye, did you not? Shisui...Uchiha? The man praised alongside
Itachi Uchiha as the Uchiha's most gifted in
the use of the Ocular Jutsu? Yes. Shisui's particular Ocular Jutsu
allowed him to enter others' minds, make them go through phantom
experiences and manipulate them. The victim would be totally unaware
that he was being manipulated. It was an Ocular Jutsu of
the highest degree! Hokage! Don't tell me Mifune
is being... But...that's... My right eye is also
a precious spoil of war, from a battle against the Hyuga. So like you, I am not really one
to talk. But you cannot fool my eye, which undid the genjutsu cast
upon the Fourth Mizukage! And... Why you! Hello! One problem after another!
Now what?! Is it the Akatsuki?! It seems so. Sasuke Uchiha has snuck in! Now, where could he be hiding?! What?! Sasuke? - Him?
- What's he doing here?! The one with the Sharingan? The one who took down
Haku and Zabuza? Who's he? A member of the Akatsuki. I believe his name was... Let's all go and look for Sasuke! Yeah! Where is Sasuke Uchiha?! Answer me! Th-This guy is super fast! If you refuse to answer,
I will show you no mercy! Sasuke... Where are you now?
And what are you thinking? Do you think about me, Sakura,
or Kakashi Sensei...even a little? You brought down your
brother Itachi. You got your revenge. Are you relieved? Or are you in more pain? Sasuke... Why won't you come home
to the Leaf Village? Has hatred consumed
you completely, Sasuke? Have you really turned into
a mere criminal? Now I'm starting to lose sight
of who you are. Hey... How about we talk,
Naruto Uzumaki? This is bad.

 What is it, Karin?

 The Samurai's movements have
suddenly become flurried. 

 I think they're looking for us!

 What?! But we didn't do anything
to be spotted.

 Must be the doing of that guy Zetsu,
who disappeared.

 That bastard...
I'll get him for this.

 There's too many of them!
They'll find us in no time.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Racing Lightning"

 I'm very irritated
right now. Tune in again!

 Hey... How about we talk, Naruto Uzumaki? You! A Rasengan right off the bat, huh? You know it doesn't work on me, right? Naruto, you just stay put. As expected, Sharingan Kakashi. You are fast. We won't let you get your hands on
Naruto that easily, Madara Uchiha. You did just hear my last line,
didn't you? No attacks work against
Madara Uchiha. I don't know if you are
merely erasing your presence or if this is an astral projection, but I know it's necessary for you
to manifest physically in order to capture Naruto. Otherwise, you couldn't actually
grab him. We'll aim for that. This here is now my territory. I never thought it would be easy.
You see, I have my own plan. But right now, I'd rather talk. Talk? Yes. What was it that made Pain, Nagato,
turn into a traitor? Naruto... You have aroused my curiosity. Who cares about something like that?! What do you intend to do
with Sasuke?! Tell me about Sasuke! Sasuke, huh? Very well. I'll tell you. About the man whose hatred
of the ninja world runs through his bones
to his very core. About Sasuke Uchiha. Sasuke's story cannot be told
without mentioning Itachi. So first, hear the truth about Itachi. Where is Sasuke?! Answer me! You leave me no choice.
I'll give you a hint, so... Shee! Begin! Yes sir! You didn't have to kill him. We could have taken him in
and tortured him into revealing intel about the Akatsuki. No one in the Akatsuki talks.
They are extremely loyal. Okisuke, Urakaku.
Issue an order to search for Sasuke. And issue a Number 2
battle-ready state alert. - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! Lord Raikage! You! One-eyed Mist! Watch the Hokage! Shee! Darui! Come! I'm so sorry about the desk
and the wall. Darui, never mind that. Let's go! What a violent fellow. The Cloud's rascal hasn't changed
even as a Kage. Number 2 battle-ready state alert. Search for the intruder, Sasuke Uchiha. Dispatch three squads
to the tower entrance. Create a line of defense. Roger. Move out! What's this?! What is it, Karin? The Samurai's movements
have suddenly become flurried. I think they're looking for us! What?! But we didn't do anything to be spotted. I bet it was Zetsu. They're already gone. Racing Lightning

 It's no good.
There are too many of them. We'll be found in no time and captured. Zetsu, was it? I'll get him for this! So that's how they use chakra? I'm very irritated right now. If you attack, I'll show no mercy. I would say the same to you! He repelled it? It's similar to our sword technique! Karin, you don't have to monitor
the Samurai anymore. Focus on Danzo's location. But what about the Samurai? I'll deal with them. Just find Danzo. Huh?! Sasuke's chakra is different! Hey... After all his warnings telling me
not to kill anyone... This is... He's not the same Sasuke
as before. He's more intense than when he is
in the Curse Mark Second State. And much... colder. He's not alone! There's one chakra that is erasing
many other chakras! No doubt it's coming from Sasuke! Which way?! Right below us! Lord Raikage, you're not going to... Something's coming. And it's huge! What is that?! Hey brat! I'm going to teach you
the fear of true fury! Sasuke! Don't go in alone! He's lost his cool! Water Style: Water Wall! His attack, huh? Lightning Style: Emotion Wave! Looks like the intel was right, Boss. This guy seems to possess
a Lightning Chakra Nature. Plus he has a Fire Chakra Nature. He's bound to use Fire Style
at some point. Darui, keep Water Style
ready at all times. Yeah. Doesn't it look like
they have intel on Sasuke? Hey, the one in the middle.
Isn't that...? They're Hidden Cloud jonin. The huge one in the middle
is their Raikage. They won't let us pass easily. Seeking reinforcements! Sasuke got us! I'll stop him! Something's coming! Lightning Illusion: Flash Pillar! Is he trying to blind us?! Sasuke! No! Jugo, don't waver.
This is a genjutsu. Not bad, Sharingan. However... You may have seen through
the genjutsu, but it's too late! Sasuke! Damn it! My Executioner's Blade! It'd already gotten cracked
against the Eight-Tails. It can't be helped. S-Saved. Nice, Suigetsu! Who told you to butt in? We came to help you,
and this is what we get? Although that's just like you. Ninja sure fight rough. They're crazy! Shee, check and see if they've got
any other allies around. I don't want to worry about
more popping in. I'm sure there was one more. But if I focus on that one,
it'll be hard to stay in the fight. We don't need you. Boss and I can handle them. Uh-oh! If I keep searching
for Danzo like this, I'll be the one found by that Shee. Karin will probably extinguish
her chakra and hide. She's got that ability. That guy in the back is probably
a Sensory-Type ninja. We have to take him down. I'll do it. It doesn't look like he'll be moving
around again. Sir Ao, please confirm if the Hokage's Ocular Jutsu
is still engaged or not. No. The flow of chakra in
his Chakra Network is very calm. The jutsu is undone. Relax. It's not a jutsu I can use
that many times in a day. I'll decide that. For you are a man
who cannot be trusted. I never imagined the Byakugan had fallen
into outside hands. Had the traitor been a Hyuga
from the Hidden Leaf, he would have been killed immediately. You are probably planning to dispose of me
for learning your secret, but that will not happen. I shall fight you at such a time. Because there may just be a connection between the jutsu that had control
over the Fourth Mizukage and your ocular powers. Lord Hokage, ninjutsu is prohibited
in this room. You have lost your credibility. Even if you hadn't resorted to this,
I may have chosen you, you know. "May have chosen" was unacceptable. I was prepared to use
any means necessary in order to protect
the world of the ninja. This world must become one. In the same way that
the First Hokage, Hashirama, united our people and
founded our village. This time, I shall unite the villages
and create one ninja world. There is no way this ninja world can
be united through discussions alone. It takes time to realize one's ideals. Impatience makes one lose sight of
his surroundings and invites failure. That's you right now. Nothing will change by
working slowly and ethically. Sooner or later, the Akatsuki will
destroy the ninja world. Well, that is just an impossible dream. It may sound noble, but ultimately, it will only breed distrust,
ill will and resentment. Why Danzo, we don't even trust
your words at this point. Whether I am trusted or not,
it's the outcome that is essential. Unable to trust each other. If that is the world... If that is being human,
there is no future. What is it you want to say? Understanding and trusting
in one another... If we lose that, only fear will remain
in the world. Acting with no regard for what is right...
resigning oneself... I find such things hard to
accept these days. For a kid who knows nothing
about governing a village yet, you speak easily about
difficult matters. Now's your chance to
ask anything you'd like. As your seniors, we're willing
to answer any questions you have. Right, Danzo? How dare you, you old geezer! Don't, Kankuro. He's still Tsuchikage.
The leader of another village. Did she just say "still"? Ignore them. Then let me ask you this. Sure. I will answer anything, kid. When did you all forsake yourselves? What a pure-hearted child. So Gaara, what will we do now? We cooperated with
the Hidden Leaf on their mission to rescue Sasuke Uchiha. But he's now descended
to joining the Akatsuki. Sasuke Uchiha... Hey! Don't go off without your guards! Gramps, he's scored a point on you. Shut it! Lord Tsuchikage...
What do we do? Shall we go forth to battle? Fool! What if the back pain gets worse?! But I want to see this Sasuke who
supposedly took down Bro Deidara. Do as you please. Just remember, if you get caught
in the Raikage's crossfire, you'll die. So stay out his way. Gotcha! What about you, Akatsuchi? I'll stay with Lord Tsuchikage,
in case he has trouble with his back. Later, then. Lord Danzo, please allow
one of us to go forth in order to retrieve the Sharingan. You Hidden Leaf will stay as you are!
Lord Raikage has so ordered! Foo, Torune...don't. We will play nice for now. I'll kill 'em! His change in personality is
more surprising than his appearance. Focus! This guy's chakra is ridiculous! Jugo voluntarily gave in to
his killer impulse this time. You think he still remembers
that we're on his side? Now then, who's first?! Don't get cocky! You're mine! Nice blade you got there. Can't have this just
because yours broke. One down. You can't take me down with
a mere Sharingan! Lord Raikage's nerve transmission
and reaction speed are on par with that of
the Leaf's Yellow Flash. Impressive that these guys are
keeping up as well as they are! But Lord Raikage has manipulated
Lightning Style Chakra to augment his reflexes. Not even the Sharingan will
be able to keep up with him. Plus, there's still... Die! Boss! From point-blank range! Did he get him?! He took Lord Raikage's blow
and still survived?! I-Is this is...a genjutsu? These guys are cleverly using
each other's attacks to divert attention. And I fell for it. Damn it! Can't...move... Shee?! Shee! Don't go to sleep! Get up! I killed him! I killed the guy! Jugo can be useful, after all. They can't detect me now. Now's my chance to find Danzo. Huh?! Who's next?! It's not too late.

 You still have the chance
to go back, Sasuke.

 What is there for me on your side
if I were to go back?

 I shut my eyes a long time ago.

 The things I seek lie only
in the darkness.

 Wait!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Sasuke's Ninja Way"

 Gaara, don't let
your personal feelings interfere.

 Tune in again!

 I-Is this is...a genjutsu? These guys are cleverly using
each other's attacks to divert attention. And I fell for it. Damn it! Can't...move... I killed him! I killed the guy! Who's next?! You're lying! That's nonsense! No, it can't be. Stop joking around.
Who'd believe that story? It's not a lie. That's the truth about Itachi. He died for Sasuke's sake and
for the Hidden Leaf Village. What does that mean? Even if it is true,
if Sasuke is aware of this, why would he help the Akatsuki? Knowing him, he would return to
the Hidden Leaf to carry on Itachi's will. As Sasuke's teacher and his friends, you might have assumed you understood
Sasuke's true feelings. But you were badly mistaken. He's the real thing. A true avenger.
That's what he is. Did you turn Sasuke into that?! No, I didn't. Sasuke chose this himself. It's a lie! I took a gamble too. Would Sasuke carry
on Itachi's wishes, or would he seek revenge against
the Hidden Leaf? He chose vengeance. In essence, he was meant to
be on our side. Sasuke's goal at this moment is to
take revenge against the Hidden Leaf for what they did to Itachi
and the Uchiha Clan. Why? Why him? Why did this happen? How could he turn to revenge?! It was inevitable. It is the Uchiha Clan's blood-soaked
destiny of hate. Like a curse that has been
passed down through the ages. A curse? Yes. A curse of hatred,
which started generations ago with the Sage of the Six Paths who is
said to be the founder of the ninja. The Sage of the Six Paths? That's just a myth. The Rinnegan was
no more than a mutation! Myths are born from truth. Long ago, the Sage of the Six Paths
preached the Ninshu and tried to lead the way to peace. But before he could realize his dream,
time ran out. The Sage of the Six Paths decided to
entrust the power and will of the Ninshu to his two children. The older son was born with
the Sage's eyes. He inherited the Sage's chakra
and mental energy, and believed that strength
was crucial to peace. The younger son was born with
the gift of the Sage's body. He inherited the Sage's life force
and physical energy, and believed that love was
crucial to peace. Ultimately, the Sage was forced to choose
his successor from his deathbed. However, his decision created a curse of hatred that
has continued for generations. What do you mean by that? Instead of his older son,
who sought strength, the Sage felt that the younger son,
who sought love, was more suitable, and named him
as his successor. The firstborn, who had long expected
to follow in his father's footsteps, could not accept the decision. Filled with rage,
he challenged his younger brother. Even as time passed and
new generations were born, the descendants of the two brothers,
continued to battle. The descendants of the older brother,
came to be known as the Uchiha. And the descendants of the younger brother
were called the Senju. As Madara Uchiha, my battle with
the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, was destined to take place. This is only the second time I've met you. But I can tell that you hold
the Senju's Will of Fire within you. I can see the First Hokage inside you. Even after death, he lives on. He, whom I admired,
yet he was my rival. And the man I hated most. The Senju and the Uchiha. The Will of Fire and hatred. Naruto and Sasuke. You both will probably be
the next chosen by fate. The Uchiha was destined to
be a clan of vengeance. Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of the Uchiha's hatred and intends to strike the world
with that curse. It is the most powerful weapon. It's his friend and source of power,
this thing called hatred. And it is Sasuke's Ninja Way! Sasuke's Ninja Way

 Chidori. Elbow Bolt! A thrust attack using the Lightning Style
to increase force and penetration. The same jutsu used
by Kakashi Hatake! I wear Lightning Style armor,
yet you actually touched me. That is some jutsu. Damn it! It didn't work?! No, it didn't. Sasuke's dead. No way! Chakra like this... Liger Bomb! It's over. So that's the Raikage's ninja taijutsu. Sasuke couldn't have survived that. We didn't need reinforcements. Huh? So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan. Shee, you okay? Darui...did you settle your fight? Maybe. No one's ever lived through
that Liger Bomb, until now. Those bones and stuff...
What is he anyway? I fell for his genjutsu and lost. I still don't have full control of my body. Geniuses like him appear once in a while. Sasuke Uchiha...
He's a stubborn one! Reinforcements?! Hey Shee... The Uchiha's eye... Doesn't it seem a bit different
from before? Mangekyo Sharingan?! I get it. That's what made
Lord Raikage activate that much. He intends to counter with
his Teleportation Jutsu.  Maybe I'm too weak against
the Lightning Style. My body's too numb and
can't liquefy properly. Raikage's chakra has grown enormous. He's at Tailed Beast levels! Come on, brat! Amaterasu! Put out the fire! It's not ordinary fire!
Don't get close to it! Amaterasu, which ignites anything
in its line of sight. So this is it. Lateral Bolt of Pain! Way to go!
A shield of Black Flames! Nothing can match
the Raikage's teleportation speed. If you can't keep up visually,
then use a shield that can't be touched! Now, he won't be able to
carelessly attack Sasuke. He's manipulating the Black Flames?! He can even change
their chakra form! Don't tell me he's more proficient
with the Black Flames than Itachi? Don't underestimate the Raikage! Lord Raikage! Impossible... He's sacrificing his left arm. You're finished! Guillotine Drop! Inferno Style: Flame Control! He's still in the air! Sasuke! Sand! This is... Gaara of the Sand. Wind Scythe Jutsu! So these are the flames
that never burn out, Amaterasu, huh? You Samurai, get back. This is a problem for the ninja world. There is no need for Samurai
to become casualties. Th-Thank you, Lord Kazekage. What's going on? Why did you interfere, Kazekage?! Whether I punish you or not
depends on your answer! If you had continued and
performed another attack, the Black Flames would
have further injured you. Besides, I wish to speak
to Sasuke Uchiha. Boss! Shee, hurry and stop the bleeding! I'm going to attack Sasuke
the minute you're done. Yes sir! Sasuke was able to lay
a hand on Lord Raikage,  who was clad in
his Lightning Style armor. And he's still alive despite
two heavy attacks. Amaterasu in his left eye. And in his right eye,  he has the ability to change the
chakra form of Amaterasu's Black Flames,  there's no mistake. Perhaps Sasuke captured Bee after all. Does that mean there's still progress
occurring in the ninja world? Your eyes are still as they were
in the past. I once told you that you
have eyes like mine. Eyes that seek strength.  Eyes overflowing with hate
and a hunger for blood. Eyes itching to kill the one who threw you
into the hell called solitude. Making revenge your sustenance
resolves nothing. I learned that lesson personally. It's not too late for you. Do not cast yourself into a world where
you are all alone, obsessed with hate. You won't be able to return. And if I returned?
What would I find there? Forget it, Gaara. Naruto already failed at convincing him. He's just a criminal now, who has fallen to the level
of the Akatsuki. He's not like you. Besides, neither the Raikage
nor the others who have been victimized by
the Akatsuki will remain silent. After attacking the Five Kage Summit,
he's now wanted internationally. This guy has no future. Sasuke, you and I are alike. We've both walked through
the darkness of this world. That's why you should be able to see
even the faintest glimmer of light. In the past and even now. I closed my eyes long ago. My goals exist only in the darkness. Leave your personal feelings
out of this. You are the Kazekage. Gaara... I know. I understand. Naruto... You will probably end up
fighting Sasuke one day. Rather...I will throw Sasuke at you. A battle that was predestined ages ago. I'll have Sasuke validate
the existence of the Uchiha. Sasuke isn't your toy! Quit making selfish plans! You think you can make Sasuke
have a change of heart, like you did with Nagato? That's just as selfish, Naruto. Controlling people requires the skill to
manipulate the darkness in their souls. Although, Nagato just happened to
be easily influenced by others. Don't liken Nagato to yourself! His ways were different,
but he truly wished for peace! But you're different! You're right. The existence of the Uchiha... If that's all you want to validate,
why hunt the Tailed Beasts? Just what is your goal? What do you hope to accomplish? Let's see... If anything, it's to become complete. Complete?! What do you mean?! Talking to you is meaningless. I'll explain more
in an appropriate place. Our conversation...was quite fun. So long. Sasuke... I'm impressed that you can guard
against my Inferno Style so effectively. Your Ultimate Defense is
in good shape. A-Amazing. Found them! Danzo's among them! I must notify Sasuke immediately! But...there's powerful chakra all around. So there's a Sensory-Type after all. It seems the enemy has
a Sensory-Type ninja. They may come here in time. What do we do? Nothing for now. When they arrive,
we'll slip out during the chaos. Stop whispering over there! Sorry, but I'm a Sensory-Type too. I'm fully aware that the enemy is on to us. But you are not to make a move. We'll deal with the enemy. It seems this summit is about
to become very interesting. Are you done yet, Shee?! Just a little longer. Comrades of the Hidden Sand! I will fire the first shot! Press ahead after me! Right! Gale Style: Laser Circus! Secret Red Move: Puppet Triad! Cyclone Scythe Jutsu! Sand Shower Barrage! Sasuke! W-What is this?! Gaara... This is even greater than
your Ultimate Defense. Did he use that to guard
against my attacks? This chakra... It's the same as that genjutsu earlier. This doesn't look good. Was this what he wanted to test? This chakra...
He's no longer the old Sasuke. It's too cold. What is that? The power...of darkness? A power that only those who have awakened the Mangekyo
in both eyes can achieve. This is the third power... Susano'o. When I look at you closely, 

 you of the Uchiha Clan are
quite handsome.

 Don't interfere!

 Such a fine man.
What a waste. 

 I'll at least give you a kiss that
will make you melt.

 Lady Mizukage is intent on fighting!

 Lord Tsuchikage,
if you're not going to participate, 

 please keep your head lowered.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Power of the Five Kage"

 Feel free to rampage as you please.

 Tune in again!

 All right. No one's around. For something I came up with
in the spur of the moment,  that was a good plan! Amaterasu! What do you mean "good plan"? You sacrificed several of my limbs. Now, now, don't get mad,
my boy Eight-o. Ya know they'll regrow,
and ya know I was right-o. Will you stop that annoying rapping
when you're in my presence? You suck! I know, I know. Since I'm the one who owns ya,
I knows best of all, ha! That's why this time... What? Don't start saying
weird stuff again. It will be enka! Anyways, now I can finally
escape Brother's bossy ways and get away from the village. I'm free! As far as he knows,
the Akatsuki's captured me. Raikage is probably on a rampage now. Are you sure about this? I've been imprisoned in
the village as a weapon all because I'm a Jinchuriki. I need to get out for
some fresh air once in a while, right? So? What are you going to do? When it comes to enka,
Kin Sensei is the man! Who is that? Huh? Blaze da name into ya brain fool. He's the King of the Enka Ninja. How can you be so carefree?
The Akatsuki won't sit still for long. Not only that, since you summoned me, you don't have much stamina left. Did you really have to call on me
when you had the advantage? Among all the guys
I've faced in battle, that Sharingan has to rank
in the top two in strength. I got carried away. Times may be changing soon. Huh? Through my enka? There's absolutely no trace left. The Transportation Technique...
It's such a troublesome jutsu. Kakashi Sensei, what he was saying... It's dangerous to believe his story. But if it's true, Sasuke is- Naruto... I know how you feel,
but you must not be impatient. For now, we'll keep what Madara
said to ourselves... in absolute secrecy. We're in the midst of reconstruction
and must avoid unnecessary mayhem. Furthermore, until we cross check
the facts, we can't trust him. There's too much that
we don't know about his claim that the higher ups in the Hidden Leaf used
Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha clan. Especially you, Naruto.
Do you understand? Yeah, I know. Power of the Five Kage

 Susano'o? So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan? That Uchiha... Always has something
hidden up his sleeve. Darui, everyone from the Sand!
Please step back! He's aiming for the pillars! The pillars! The ceiling won't hold! What the hell?! Were you able to pinpoint
Danzo's location? Y-Yeah. Take me there. What about Jugo and Suigetsu? Their chakra is still... Never mind! Danzo comes first. Hurry and take me there. O-Okay. What's happened to you, Sasuke?! They're all right too. Sorry...Kazekage. Looks like Sasuke used
that instant to get away. If things are this bad here, who knows what may have
happened to the others. We're going after Sasuke immediately! Looks like he's headed up. Naruto... What would you have done? Good thing that blade missed, but still... I wonder how Sasuke,
Karin and Jugo are doing. I'll still make it. All right. He's come. Above?! He's using the Sharingan. Sasuke! Danzo is escaping! Lord Mizukage and Chojuro, stay here! I'm going after Danzo! Since the summit isn't over yet! All right. But don't pursue him too far. Yes ma'am!
I'll leave the Akatsuki rebels to you. My back can't take it. You people can deal with them
as you please. Sounds good to me. Karin! Come! There it is. Lady Mizukage's Kekkei Genkai,
Lava Style Jutsu! You Akatsuki manipulated
the Fourth Mizukage and trampled all over the Hidden Mist. And yet when I look at you closely,
you of the Uchiha Clan are quite handsome. Don't interfere. Such a fine man...
What a waste. I'll at least give you a kiss
that will make you melt. A-A kiss?! Just who the hell are you?! And quit trying to seduce him,
you old hag! Lady Mizukage is intent on fighting! I must protect her! But... He's the one who killed Zabuza. Do I even have a chance? Yes, even someone like me
has a chance. I can do it. I have to keep telling myself that. Lord Tsuchikage, if you're not going to participate,
please keep your head lowered. Not that again! Keep my head lowered? The nerve. Chojuro! Y-Yes ma'am! Hiramekarei release! Every cell in my body hurts. Is this the side effect of using
Susano'o... for an extended period? I haven't even achieved
complete possession form and yet there's so much pain. What did Itachi endure? It's just the two of us now. S-So he was killed? I couldn't read his chakra,
so I thought something was strange. The wall next to you... I closed it up after that first attack. It's now a completely sealed room. There's no way to escape. I use three Chakra Natures:
Fire, Water and Earth. That's why I possess two Kekkei Genkai. Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu. Sasuke! He's on the other side of that wall. It's melting. This is bad.
Sasuke's chakra is weakening! He's overdoing it! It seems you got roughed up
pretty badly by Lord Raikage earlier. Sorry, but I have no intention
of helping you. It pains my heart every time
I see such a handsome man melt away. But you have to die. So this time, it's corrosive acid mist? What? Wha-?! What is it?! This chakra... Th-This is that Akatsuki from earlier. It's that man's... I can't believe no one detected
my Sporulation Jutsu. The Five Kage are just a bunch of idiots. He's... using my chakra. He's absorbing chakra and growing?! When did he do this? It's a Time-Lapse Jutsu that
he planted before Raikage beat him. Why you- Damn... What now?! My chakra is returning! This is... Sasuke! Are you all right?! The mist will leak to where
the others are. I have to adjust the pH level. It seems they're having difficulties. Akatsuchi, shall we go and
lend them a hand soon? Okay! Earth Style: Weighted Boulder Jutsu. So a brat like you defeated Deidara? Well, I hold no grudge against you,
but many ninja wish you dead. So long. Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! Sasuke! Sasuke's chakra is...gone! I-It can't be... You're right, because I've disassembled his body
at a near molecular level! You're next. W-Why you... Sasuke? Where is Sasuke?! Kankuro. Got it. Th-Thank you. I am indebted to you. Tsuchikage! Where is Sasuke?! I turned him into dust. What?! I wanted to do that! You had no right- You still...have a chance. So stop making a fuss, Raikage. My name is Madara Uchiha. Sasuke! I have something I want
to explain to you all. And once you comprehend it,
I want to pose a question. What is it?! It's about my plan... Project Tsuki no Me. So that's what Project Tsuki no Me is.

 Stop joking around, I'm not handing
the world over to you!

 Peace is only meaningful when
it is genuinely achieved. 

 It's just an escape!

 Unfortunately, the discussion is over.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Declaration of War"

 The next time we meet,
will be on the battlefield.

 Tune in again!

 When we enter the Land of Iron,
please find Naruto, Kiba. I know! What's wrong? All Ino could do was cry. But look at Sakura's determination. I don't know what she'll say to Naruto, but it's gonna get
really uncomfortable. I'm sure Sakura's got some ideas. Four-man squads are the standard, but any search mission
usually includes me. Plus, I've got that secret request
from Sai. I need to use my nose
to see if the Foundation, the Anbu under Danzo, is following us. Talk about working us to the bone.
Ain't that right, Akamaru? Hey you!
Look at what you’ve done! That's why I hate ninja. I-I'm sorry. I'll make sure it's repaired. Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of the Uchiha’s hatred and intends
to strike the world with that curse. It is the most powerful weapon. It’s his friend and source of power,
this thing called hatred. And it is Sasuke’s Ninja Way! Sasuke chose this himself. The only thing left to do
is to ask him myself. It seems Shee was right.
The Hokage did make an escape. Yes, because of Sasuke. Nothing planned by the Akatsuki
is going to be good. Who knows what you're up to? Sasuke is… Bring Sasuke back! Then listen to my explanation. It will all depend on your answer. Calm down, Raikage. Let's hear him out,
and take it from there. Revive Sasuke. So that's Madara's ability? The Transportation Technique. Where am I? Now then, are you all ready to listen? Why are you trying to win Sasuke over? A Sharingan capable of awakening
the Susano'o is rare. I like to stock up on good eyes. By battling the Five Kage, I wanted him to hone
his ocular powers even more. I'm the one who sent Sasuke here. I was intending on weakening the Five Kage
and taking you all hostage. It seems that is still not possible. Taking us hostage?
For what purpose?! To smoothly implement
the aforementioned Project Tsuki no Me. It's quite shocking to learn that
Madara Uchiha is still alive, but why would a man of your skill
resort to such a roundabout method? Surely, you have the strength
to bring any plan to fruition. The injuries I sustained during my battle with the First Hokage Hashirama
were too severe. I have no strength in me now. You could say I am merely
a shell of my old self. Is this a plan to restore yourself? You could say that.
But that's not all. What are you scheming?! Just what is this Project Tsuki no Me?! I want to take my time talking to you.
Let me sit down. We’re asking you
what kind of plan it is! All shall become one with me, and result in a complete
possession form that unites all. Become one? Unite all? What do you mean?! The Uchiha have
an ancient stone tablet that has been passed down
through the generations. It still exists underground in
the Hidden Leaf Village. Upon it are written secrets, engraved by the Sage of
the Six Paths himself. It cannot be read unless
you possess ocular powers. With the Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan
and Rinnegan, in that order, the contents become
increasingly visible. Your story is unlikely.
The Sage of the Six Paths doesn't… It is the truth! He did exist.
And he left the stone tablet. Don't change the subject! What does your plan have to do
with the Sage of the Six Paths?! Do you know why he became
a legendary figure and a godlike figure
that is revered as a god of ninja? There lies the link between my plan
and this man. Madara Uchiha… You possess the Mangekyo Sharingan
and among the Akatsuki, there was one who possessed
the Rinnegan. You know everything, don't you? We're listening. He once saved the world
from a certain monster. Monster? Gaara, you also had one part of
that monster sealed inside you. That monster was the combination of
every Tailed Beast in existence. Something that possessed
the most powerful chakra. The Ten-Tails! Declaration of War

 That monster was the combination
of every Tailed Beast in existence. Something that possessed
the most powerful chakra. The Ten-Tails. Aren't there only nine Tailed Beasts?! I just told you. It was the combination of
all the Tailed Beasts. Shukaku, Gaara's Tailed Beast
known as… the One-Tail! The fiery Monster Cat of
the Hidden Cloud's Yugito Ni’i… the Two-Tails! The former Mizukage's… Three-Tails! Roshi of the Lava Style’s… Four-Tails! Han of the Hidden Stone’s… Five-Tails! The Rogue Ninja Utakata’s… Six-Tails! Fuu of the Hidden Waterfalls’… Seven-Tails! Raikage's younger brother,
Killer Bee’s… Eight-Tails! And the fox spirit of the Hidden Leaf… the Nine-Tails! The Ten-Tails' chakra was simply
divided up into the nine Tailed Beasts, by the Sage of the Six Paths. I don't like where this story is headed. Is that why the Akatsuki are
gathering the Tailed Beasts? The Sage of the Six Paths
developed a certain ninjutsu in order to protect the world
from the Ten-Tails. Even today, that ninjutsu is still
being secretly passed down. It is the Sealing Jutsu process
for Jinchuriki. Yes, the Sage of the Six Paths was
the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki. In order to suppress it,
he sealed the Ten-Tails within his body. The Sage, who saved
a world terrorized by the Ten-Tails, became a savior and won praise as a god. But if the Sage died, the powerful
and demonic chakra of the Ten-Tails would once again be released
unto the world. Fearing this, at the time of his death, the Sage of the Six Paths summoned
every last ounce of his power to partition the Ten-Tails' chakra
into nine parts and scattered them across the world. Then he sealed the Ten-Tails' body,
now devoid of chakra, and hurled it into the sky. And it became the moon. What a tall tale!
As if a human could do such a thing. When he became
the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails, the Sage of the Six Paths went
beyond the realm of humans. I understand now that
you seek that inhuman power by gathering the chakra of the nine,
namely all, of the Tailed Beasts. But what will you do with all that power? Revive the Ten-Tails. And I will become
the Ten-Tail’s Jinchuriki. I will use its power to strengthen
my ocular powers, and activate a certain jutsu. A certain jutsu?! What is it? What do you intend to do? A Super Genjutsu,
where I project my eyes off the moon. Infinite Tsukuyomi. I will cast a genjutsu on every human
that walks the earth. And in that genjutsu, I will control
all humans and unify the world. A world without hatred or war. Everything will become one with me,
everything will be united. That is my Project Tsuki no Me. Stop joking around!
I’m not handing the world over to you! Peace that exists only as
an illusion is deception. Peace is only meaningful when it is
genuinely achieved in the real world. So what exists inside such a world? There is no hope, no dreams!
It’s just an escape! Unite the world, huh? Danzo mentioned something similar. But instead of uniting the world, it just sounds like you want to
make the world yours! All this talk and yet,
what have you Five Kage accomplished? You of all people should know by now… There is no such thing as hope! To hope is equivalent to giving up, and it’s the biggest deception of all. Turn over the remaining
Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, and cooperate with my plan. Or there will be war. War you say? The Eight-Tails?
What are you talking about? Didn't you get Bee? The attempt to capture
the Eight-Tails failed and he escaped. He is a ninja who is a perfect Jinchuriki. Only your younger brother
has got what it takes. Huh?! Yeah, I sort of had a feeling about that. That idiot! He used that chance to slip away and now,
he's having the time of his life! Unforgivable!
He's going to get my Iron Claw! We will not hand over Naruto Uzumaki. I agree with him! What about you, Raikage? There's no way I'll let him have
my younger brother! I don't have the strength, but the Tailed Beasts
we've gathered so far, do. You people have no chance of winning. We haven't given up hope. Very well. I hereby declare the start
of the Fourth Great Ninja War. The Fourth Great Ninja War? Are you mad?! The next time we meet will be
on the battlefield. Well then, what do we do now? We have to form
an Allied Shinobi Force. It’s the only way we can counter
the power of the seven Tailed Beasts. You were opposed to this,
weren't you, Lord Raikage? It seems my younger brother is alive. We cannot allow ourselves to be
manipulated by the Akatsuki any longer. Form the alliance and
settle this once and for all! What about the Hidden Leaf?
The Hokage ran off. There is too much suspicion
surrounding Danzo. He lost our trust at this summit. When the Hidden Leaf ninja
learn about him, his position in the village will
become insecure. He will be removed in no time! I will speak to someone I trust among
the Hidden Leaf regarding the Allied Shinobi Force. Who would that be? Kakashi Hatake of the Sharingan. You mean the White Fang’s son? Right here and now, this young ninja,
no matter how awkwardly, is bowing his head in his affection for the Cloud and Leaf,
village and nation. Lord Raikage… As one of the five Kage,
what do you think of this? Fine. He seems more trustworthy
than Danzo. Agreed. Lord Raikage, we must take measures
to find Killer Bee immediately! If the Akatsuki want
the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, they are probably still pursuing Bee. Yes. Shee, send word to
the village to put together a Tracking Unit to begin the search
for Bee immediately! Yes sir! We must notify Samui's team too. Omoi and Karui have been
feeling quite distraught. If we are to stop
Madara's Project Tsuki no Me, we cannot let the Eight-Tails and
Nine-Tails fall into his hands. I think it is imperative that
our Allied Shinobi Forces find the two first and place them into hiding. Y-You're absolutely right! If the day comes when
this Ten-Tails is revived… However, we cannot even imagine
the power Madara wields with the seven Tailed Beasts
he already has. Furthermore, he may possess
certain jutsu or a trump card for using the Tailed Beasts. Otherwise, he wouldn't have
come on so strong. Perhaps it would be wise for
the Allied Shinobi Forces to plan on using the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails
as military weapons too. That cannot happen. This is also a war to protect those two. There is a reason why Madara
is waging war with just the seven Tailed Beasts
he has collected thus far. It is too difficult for Madara,
in his weakened state, and the Akatsuki members to capture
the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. And even if they had succeeded,
he felt the risk was too great. That is why he may be hoping to
lure the two to his side through war. In any case, using the Eight-Tails
and Nine-Tails for battle is not a wise strategy. I agree. I also concur with the Kazekage. If we consider
the worst-case scenario, it will be like offering the Eight-Tails
or Nine-Tails on a silver platter! And besides, the Eight-Tails is
my younger brother and "military strategy" is
a foreign concept to him. I can’t predict what he’d do. Yay! He may just create more chaos
on the battlefield! Naruto the Nine-Tails,
would do the same. – That's for sure.
– I'll say. I understand.
Well then, Lord Tsuchikage, our aim will be to protect and
confine the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. Fine. Intel about Killer Bee
will be provided to the Stone, Mist, Sand and Leaf Villages. Use it to form Tracking Units
and get moving! Send word the instant
you find the Eight-Tails. My younger brother will
only heed orders from me! By the way, Kazekage, we will leave
the matter with Kakashi to you. Yes. On my way here, I met Kakashi Hatake and
the boy who is the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki. They might still be here
in the Land of Iron. You should start your search
for them here. Understood. U-Um… May I say something? What is it? Uh… Yes… Umm… Spit it out! I-In the Akatsuki, there's someone who,
like me, is a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.
Kisame Hoshigaki. He has chakra equal to that
of a Jinchuriki as well as a sword known
as Samehada, Shark Skin, which is the most evil, even among
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. When his chakra and sword merge,
even though he is human, he releases power close to
that of a Jinchuriki. He is like a Tailed Beast
without the tail. That's what I've been told by my seniors. He is extraordinary and
must not be underestimated. We already know that! But are you all sure about this plan? We do not know what kind of power the seven Tailed Beasts possess
under Madara. If we confine the Eight-Tails
and Nine-Tails, and our Allied Shinobi Force is destroyed
while protecting these Tailed Beasts, our entire effort would
have been meaningless. If that is the case, I think it is better to
use the two right from the beginning in a combined effort with
the Allied Shinobi Forces. I wonder about that. At this moment, the world's first
Allied Shinobi Force is being formed. Its power is also unknown. Madara will also be taking a great risk in pitting the power of
the seven Tailed Beasts against it. Otherwise, why would he have come
to this summit to try to negotiate? He must also be dealing with
unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, we Samurai
will also participate in this war! Lord Tsuchikage…
Do you still have doubts even now? Looks like the Raikage and
Kazekage went upstairs. Sasuke and Karin must
have gone ahead. We should go up too. But it's guarded. We'll be spotted right away. Well, I have a good way. What the hell was he? So gross! If we keep doing what
we’ve always done, we’ll never find Sasuke. I’ve got to use Sage Mode. But first, I need to be able
to sustain it longer. Naruto, come inside soon. Finally found you! Sakura… Sai, Kiba, and even Bushy Brows? Why did you all come here? Naruto… I need to talk to you. W-What is happening?!
Sakura, is this the truth?

 Sakura, you’re…

 Is this really how you feel?

 Stop Yamato, let’s hear her out.

 Is this for real, Sakura?

 Yes, I just finally realized
my true feelings.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“Sakura’s Feelings”

 What’s going on?

 Tune in again!

 Shinobi… We Shinobi we endure… Shinobi suppressing our sobs! You don’t just sing enka.
Enka requires a passion-filled soul! Now you try singing. Yeah! Shinobi, by being so stealthy… we extend our life expectancy. You lack passion. Passion! You're just mouthing the lyrics
and not taking it seriously! Passion? That’s right! Passion! As the characters in “enka” imply, it’s important to act out the world
in the song with passion! Also, the tremolo,
you have to clench your belly and bring the note into your nose,
all right? What’s the matter, Ponta? He’s one of the Akatsuki, Master Kin. This personal biz will take a second, what a miff,
but no worries I’ll erase him in a jiff! I searched high and low for you,
Eight-Tails. My great blade Samehada
loves powerful chakra. And it seems to have finally caught scent
of some delicious chakra. I'm sorry, but you're going to
be food for my Samehada. Not to worry though, I won't kill you. But I'll kill you. I'll show you that
we're worlds apart in power. So prepare ya-self, fool, ya fool! My rhymes are… Ponta! You sure are chatty for a Jinchuriki. There's a peculiar bear upstaging you! Sakura's Feelings

 After what we learned about Danzo,
who was your initial choice? The question of who will lead
the Allied Shinobi Forces is still an issue. Is there any among the current Kage
you consider competent enough? Mifune, you criticized every Kage
including me. I believe appointing Lord Ei
would be the wisest move. Didn't you say that Ei
was unsuitable because he gives in to his emotions
and relies on power? There is no longer any doubt
that the Eight-Tails is alive. Furthermore, he skillfully built
a consensus earlier and was quick to come up with
a counter strategy. And Lord Ei is the only one capable
of controlling the Eight-Tails, which is key to this battle. Mizukage, Kazekage…
Are you in agreement? This is not the time to argue. I trust Lord Raikage. We'll leave it to you, Raikage. Understood. I will lead the Allied Forces. Ohnoki the Fence Sitter, since you are the only one
who has battled Madara Uchiha, we'll need any intel you can give us. I expect your cooperation. He certainly enjoys barking orders
at everyone. If you don't trust me, fine. But if we don't do something, the ninja world as we know it
will disappear. Now is the time to put
personal differences aside and cooperate! Well, it's certainly better than
losing this war. Our arguments are nothing compared
to a world without ninja. So I shall cooperate. The Allied Shinobi Forces
are hereby formed. First, we must notify the Feudal Lords. Huh? W-What did you just say, Sakura? I think I heard wrong.
Could you say it again? I said… I… love you, Naruto. I said Sasuke doesn’t mean
anything to me anymore. I must have been crazy to carry
a torch for him for so long. Listen carefully when
someone confesses her feelings for you! But why? What for?! This isn't the place to be joking around.
It's not funny, Sakura. What's going on? Nothing really! I just woke up. Why should I love a Rogue Ninja
who’s a criminal? I'm not a child anymore.
I can face reality. So Naruto, you can forget about
that promise you made to me. You can stop chasing
after Sasuke, all right? What's going on? Do you think Naruto will calmly
accept our decision? But this is something we all decided. We have to make him understand. I'll talk to Naruto about everything. You, Sakura? Do you have a plan that'll work? Just leave everything to me. So don't say anything to Naruto. Please promise me this, everyone. And… Damn it…
Is this what she had in mind? Sakura, did something happen? This is all so sudden. Nothing happened! It’s obvious why I fell in love with you. All I really want, is for you
to accept me, Sasuke. That’s all… I’m desperate. Sasuke! Sasuke! Sasuke! Naruto, this is
a once in a lifetime request. Please, bring Sasuke back! Next time I'm coming with you. Sasuke… Sakura…you… Sasuke keeps getting
farther and farther away from me. But Naruto, you've always
stuck by my side and cheered me up. Naruto, I finally realized… your true self. Even that time with Pain… You returned when
you were needed most. The hero who protected the village. Today, everyone in the village
admires you. And I'm simply one of them now. You used to be a prank-loving loser. But now you’ve become
a wonderful person. And I’ve witnessed it all, first-hand. Meanwhile, Sasuke keeps adding
to his crimes, and breaking my heart. Always becoming more of a stranger. But you Naruto,
I’m able to be close to you like this. You comfort me. I care about you,
from the bottom of my heart— Cut it out, Sakura. This joke isn't funny at all! Why are you so upset? I'm just telling you that I like you now
instead of Sasuke. You know the saying, “women are
as fickle as the autumn weather.” I hate people who lie to themselves! I'm lying to myself? I'm the one who decides how I feel! If you hate me,
just come out and say so! Don’t just make up a convenient excuse. But it doesn't make sense! You came all the way out here
just to tell me that? "Just" to tell you? "Just"? You don’t think it's a big deal for
a girl to profess her love?! I came “all the way out here”? Of course,
I’d come all the way out here! Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke!
That's all you think about! Going after Sasuke and
putting yourself in danger! You’re the Nine-Tails’ Jinchuriki
and the Akatsuki are after you! Worry about yourself for a change. I'm saying that it's not necessary
to endanger yourself just to chase after Sasuke! I want you to come back to the village now,
that's why I'm here. That's all! I think it just sounds
like a painful excuse. I know you pretty well, Sakura. Then why don’t you understand? I don't care about Sasuke
now that he’s a criminal. So the promise between us
doesn't matter anymore. It’s not just about the promise. I kind of understand more now, about why Sasuke has become
obsessed with revenge and is causing so much damage. Sasuke loved his family and his clan. Because his love was so deep,
it’s hard for him to forgive. If he were so devoted, why would he join the Akatsuki after
defeating the unforgivable Itachi? That’s not how it went down. What really happened… Naruto! For now, we'll keep what Madara
said to ourselves… in absolute secrecy. We're in the midst of reconstruction and
must avoid unnecessary mayhem. Furthermore, until we cross check the facts,
we can't trust him. There's too much that
we don't know about his claim that the higher-ups of the Hidden Leaf
used Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha Clan. Especially you, Naruto.
Do you understand? It doesn’t matter, even if
there’s no promise between us anymore. I personally want to save Sasuke. What now, Sakura? Maybe you should just
tell him the truth. Oww! Forget it! I'm going back. Let's go, Kiba, Lee, Sai! Sakura… Let's go. Naruto…I'm sorry! Are you okay with this, Sakura? Kiba, I need a favor. What is it? I'm going to start looking
for Sasuke right now! Will you help me? If we just got rid of the Eight-Tails’
and Nine-Tails’ hosts, we could stop Madara's plan and weaken the military power of
the Cloud and the Leaf. We could kill two bird
with one stone! It was agreed that this time,
we will do no such thing. Why not?! That’s not like you,
Stubborn Geezer! Then let me ask you this. Sure. I will answer anything, kid. When did you all forsake yourselves? It’s because I remembered. Remembered what? I remembered who I was
before I became so stubborn! Ponta… He may be big,
but he’s not a bear worth shredding! Ponta is a raccoon! You will feel the passion of my wrath! Passion? So you can use it
in this sort of situation. Okay, got it! PONTA IS A RACCOON

I'd better add that Ponta is a raccoon. So you mean… you're going
to get in my way! A pencil whose penetrating power
has been increased by high frequency oscillations
generated by the Lightning Style, huh? That’s even greater than
the Wind Style’s penetration power. High frequency indeed. If I had taken a direct hit,
it would have left a hole in me. Yosaku Chop! He's watching my moves and using
Lightning Style enhanced ninja tools from mid-range distances. But it's also a diversionary tactic
to try to confine me. Now twice you shall be perfo-rated.
Don’t let that make me hated. What's going on?! Bee's Super Vibrato Lightning Blade
didn’t pierce through? Well then… Eight-Tails’ Cloak! Head butt! All right. That guy’s head will roll. You... My chakra… Bee! I saw it! It's that sword!
It’s sucking away your chakra! It probably absorbed the chakra out
of your Super Vibrato Lightning Blade before it even made contact! That's why it didn't pierce through. Your octopus-flavored chakra
must be very appealing. It's rare that Samehada
gets this worked up. You are worthy of shredding. Your eyes are cute, it’s so surprising. But making them into dead fish eyes…
is what I’m devising. You… Umm… Kisame Hoshigaki,
pleased to meet you after the fact. A Tailed Beast Cloak with
only seven chakra tails…

 Does this mean
you’re going to get serious?

 I’m gonna make you weep!
You sharky creep!

 Ink in your mouth…

 The rumors are true.
You really are an octopus brat.

 Did you know? Octopi eat sharks.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
The Tailed Beast
vs.
The Tailless Tailed Beast

 This time, the shark shall
devour the octopus.
 
 Tune in again!

 It appears to be a jutsu
where a seed-like clone parasitizes a life form with chakra
and feeds on its host's chakra. So that's why you didn't notice it. Most likely a ninjutsu of the Akatsuki
we saw at the meeting. And what about the other one
who has been following us all along? He continues to tail us. Probably the Byakugan user
from the Hidden Mist. Him? There. It would be a stroke of luck
if he falls for this. Your traps are special.
It'll work. Dead or alive, make sure
you gouge out his right eye. Yes, sir! Kisame Hoshigaki,
pleased to meet you after the fact. Kisame Hoshigaki, eh? Ink in your mouth… The rumors are true.
You really are an octopus brat. I’m gonna make you weep!
You sharky creep! A Tailed Beast Cloak with
only seven chakra tails… Does this mean
you're going to get serious? Did you know? Know what? Octopi eat sharks! The sword dodged on its own! Bee! That sword sucked out
Bee's chakra again and has grown even bigger! This time, the shark shall
devour the octopus. That sword Samehada's got
a big appetite and it's a speed-eater, but it looks like it can only devour
six tails' worth of chakra at one time. If that's the situation with this version, then my next version
should do the trick. Samehada has never grown
this big before. Its delight is not trivial either. What'll we do, Bee? I'll help. Enter Tailed Beast State! Judging from the markings,
Ao went this way. Let us hurry. Yes, ma'am! Tailed Beast vs.
The Tailless Tailed Beast

 Take care of my body, Torune. A booby trap. It must be Danzo's. CURSE Why am I seeing
my own body?! Gotcha. What's going on? You are under my Mind Transfer
Puppet Curse Jutsu. Damn it! Was this
a curse-type Mind Transfer Jutsu that activates itself when
the object is attacked?! Your mind is now sealed inside
that puppet. And I am in possession… of your body. Damn it. It's useless. Forget it. That is a Barrier Ninjutsu that
only us Hidden Mist Black Ops, the Shinobi Tracking Unit, can undo. My Byakugan is precious,
the only one that the Mist possesses. Do not think that you'll be able
to reclaim it easily. So it self-activates
when the eye is at risk, eh? A fitting jutsu coming from you guys, also known as the Undertaker Squad. I don't expect it to be easy. Taking your eye means that I,
as the jutsu caster, will lose my own eye. You know that. So it's Danzo's orders? Just what does he think of
his subordinates? If the Mist's military power becomes
greatly diminished because of it, losing one of my eyes is
a cheap price to pay. Though, thanks to your barrier,
it's not going to happen at this rate. But there are plenty of other options. Enter Tailed Beast State, Bee! No way, fool, ya fool! An attack with you would
be way too huge and would destroy the area. Master Kin and Ponta are
here with us, don't forget! Besides, I finally managed to
sneak off under the radar. If I let you out, it'll be like
announcing that Killer Bee is here! It's not like you to make excuses, Bee! So what'll you do?
Fight in Version 2 State? Oh yeah. ‘Cept most of my chakra got taken away
during those last few exchanges, so lend me yours. If it weren't for me,
you'd have lost a long time ago. Ya sure got a cheeky personality, but I'm still grateful for
your hospitality, yeah! Huh? Going into a Tailed Beast State, eh? No, this is a Tailed Beast's power
trapped in a humanoid form. It's Version 2 State! Lariat! Samehada is so excited
it's tripping out. The chakra earlier is nothing compared
to this volume and quality. I'm amazed he can control this
much chakra without losing his mind. There's no way to devour
this much chakra. You did it! I can't believe I was reduced back
to Version 1 State. He's still alive! Hurry and finish him! You've sure done it. What is that?! The stronger my opponent,
the stronger I become. I do not tire. I do not fall. So his blade steals his enemy's chakra and transfers it to its master
in the form of stamina? And that's why
I'm called the Tailless Tailed Beast. Water Style:
Super Exploding Water Shock Wave!  What do you plan to do? I'm simply going to jump down
and behead you. If I can't remove your eye, then I'll just have to take
your entire head back to the Leaf with me. You're going to kill yourself? No. I'll undo this Mind Transfer Jutsu
just before the blade cuts your neck. Either way, you'll die. And I, back in my body, can retrace
my steps here to grab your head. Fine. Just make sure you're careful. Or else you'll fail. What do you mean? Because if you get nervous and
release that jutsu an instant too soon, I'll defend myself from your sickle! If I'm not dead, the tables will be turned
when you come to get my head. Remember that. Saved. What happened? I was caught in the enemy's jutsu
and couldn't move my body. If you hadn't come, I would be dead. That was a very close call. I'm sorry I made you worry. Couldn't move? It must have been a genjutsu
or something. It was a type of Mind Transfer Jutsu. Your right eye… The enemy was after the Byakugan,
weren't they? They almost succeeded in smashing it. I'm sorry, but can you untie me? Of course. I'll also undo that jutsu protecting
your right eye. Thank you, that will help. What is that? No! He hasn't undone
the Mind Transfer Jutsu yet! She fell for it. If the Mizukage can undo the jutsu
protecting this right eye, I couldn't ask for anything better. I can destroy the Byakugan and
then undo the Mind Transfer Jutsu. He must be that Sensory-Type ninja!
This was his plan all along! No, Lady Mizukage! This should do. Lady Mizukage? Lend me your Hiramekarei, Chojuro. Huh? You are not Ao. I cannot undo the jutsu
on that right eye. Ao knows that well. Besides, Ao would never apologize
to Chojuro. You played me…
you sly old vixen— Ow! I-I wasn't the one who said that…ma'am. Oh, you're back to normal. I'll kill him!
That Sensory-Type Hidden Leaf ninja! It's a good thing she didn't use
the Hiramekarei on you, sir. Foo. Well? Forgive me, sir. I have failed. It cannot be helped. The longer this battle drags on, the more chakra will be shaved from you
and the greater you will weaken. And I'll grow proportionately stronger. Bee! You must take his sword away! That sword is the key to his strength! That's if you can pull it off my body. He merged with his sword?! He's like a fish that became a man. Or is it a man that's half fish? That's too much explaining!
He's half fish, half man! Here I come! At this rate,
both Master Kin and Ponta will drown. First, we have to get out of the water! You cannot escape this Water Style Jutsu. I have the advantage in
this location right now. I can't see the boundary!
So much water! So crazy! Bee! Behind you! These circumstances are hunky-dory!
I won't be taken down, sorry! This isn't the time for
your lame rapping! The water bubble is in motion and that half-fish guy
is at the center! Pay attention! And he's faster under water
than we are! Plus he's half fish,
so he probably breathes through gills! Just running away
is gonna get us killed. So what'll we do? Akatsuki's target is you, Bee! Leave that enka geezer
and the raccoon and run in a different direction! He's definitely gonna come after you. I see. That way, those two can… Right! While he's pursuing you,
the water will move with him. Then those two can
get out of the water. All right! Now come this way! What?! I must capture the Eight-Tails alive, but there's no rule against
killing these two! I ain't letting that happen, ya fool! Wha—?! I got you! Suction pads?! Gotcha! No way will you keep
taking my chakra. Fool, ya fool! You really are worthy of being
called the perfect Jinchuriki. To be able to change just one part of
yourself into your Tailed Beast is impressive. All right, they're out. You seem to be
having trouble breathing. It was a good idea,
but as long as you're touching me, you'll continue losing chakra. I can see why Samehada
can't contain his excitement. He has discovered
his favorite kind of chakra. No one in the Akatsuki is as good as
I am at taking prey alive. This Water Prison Shark Dance Jutsu
is so much fun because I can probe
the amount of chakra to shave until you're just on the verge of death. I must admit to failing once in a while. I guess I have to use Lariat again.
I just have to time it right. Don't! You can't beat him underwater! That last attempt with
the octopus leg put him on guard. Just make a run for it! Use that! Ink… A smokescreen. You are an octopus, after all. However… With my body merged with Samehada,
I can detect chakra through my skin. It seems you'll run
out of chakra soon. Bee… I'm coming…Bee! The Eight-Tails turned out to
be rather disappointing too. I can't chance you squirming around and going into
a Tailed Beast State again. So I'm going to cut off your legs
as a precaution. He took most of my chakra too! Damn it! Get up, Bee! We're in a real bind! Though, my blade doesn't cut cleanly! What's the matter? Don't tell me you've become
attached to the Eight-Tails. You like his chakra that much, Samehada? That was chakra you took from me! Very well.
Shall we exchange weapons then? This sword… It looks like it has a nice, sharp edge! Now! A pencil?! Too bad. Definitely too bad. So that was your plan, eh? Sorry we're late, Bee. Brother… Raikage? How did you find us? That mass of water you created
was quite visible. And I perceived Bee and
the Eight-Tails' chakra mixed inside it. You really went to town sucking up
someone else's chakra and using it for yourself. It was so obvious. Guess you found us, after all. That Samehada… It's giving
the Eight-Tails more chakra! Let's do it. Okay, Brother. Water Style:
Super Shark Bomb— — Double Lariat!
— Double Lariat! I must say, you two are too fast. Brother… No! Wandering around by yourself! Even ya non-dominant arm does me
a lot o' harm! Sound da alarm! This is also a battle to protect you.

 Naruto… You said you would
one day become Hokage.

 I became Kazekage.

 If you made the decision to shoulder
the name of Kage,

 then you must do what is necessary
as Sasuke's friend.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"As One's Friend"

 I will protect you with my life.

 Tune in again!

 How was the lower level? Everyone was annihilated except for us. It seems like two of Sasuke's subordinates
are still around here. Did you see them? We haven't seen them. They probably died too. Everything is a mess down there. No. A Sensory-Type Ninja
from the Hidden Cloud confirmed that they survived. They asked us to capture them
and then they left. Oh, is that so? You two… Remove your armor. Oh my, it seems we've been found out. Just as I thought,
that wasn't a very good plan. Sakura, why did you do
something like that? Sai! What are you doing here? It's a clone. I'm going to tell you what Sakura really wanted to say earlier,
but couldn't. "Really wanted to say"? What do you mean, Sai? Sakura didn't come to
confess her love for you. The Hidden Leaf Ninja have
come to a consensus and I'm here to inform you. I thought it was strange. So she was hiding something after all. I've come to understand her feelings. Why Sakura couldn't bring
herself to tell you. Tell me, Sai… about the consensus. The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke. Every one of your comrades is committed
to that and will act accordingly. As One's Friend

 The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke. Every one of your comrades is committed
to that and will act accordingly. Did Sakura…
Did Sakura really agree to that?! Sakura loves Sasuke so much! And yet… How could she?! After Akatsuki's attack on our village, the Hidden Leaf Ninja can no longer
recognize Sasuke as one of their own, not after he supported the Akatsuki. Sakura is not a fool. She's not a child who wouldn't understand
the difficulty of the situation. That's why we came here in person
to try to explain it to you. Then why didn't she just come out
and tell me the truth? It wasn't that simple.
You know that. She understood how hurt
you would feel. But still… By telling you
she's given up on Sasuke and declaring her love for you, she was freeing you from the burden
of that promise you made. Naruto, this is a once
in a lifetime request. Please…bring Sasuke back! And still, you insisted
on rescuing Sasuke. I believe that's why
she couldn't tell you the truth. Because she was thinking
about your feelings. In fact, she probably expected you
to say that. To be honest, Sakura made us promise
not to tell you the truth. She said she would tell you somehow. She said it was her duty to do so. But if she was expecting
Naruto's reaction, she never intended to
tell him the truth, right? What is Sakura planning to do? This is just an assumption on my part. But I believe Sakura… She intends to kill Sasuke herself. Is that true, Sai?! Probably. Please don't take it all on yourself. I feel the same way as you. So does everyone else. Oh…yeah. Thank you, Sai. I know. Sakura smiled and told everyone
she would cooperate. But this time,
I saw through her fake smile. No way.
Sakura wouldn't do such a thing. She's crazy about Sasuke— It's because she loves him so much that she can't bear to watch
Sasuke turn more and more evil. It's because she loves him so much that she wants to save Sasuke
from this path of evil. Even if that means killing the one
she loves with her own hands. That is how committed she is
to her love for Sasuke. And in doing so, Naruto… She's prepared to accept your hatred. It's her way of atoning for
the lifelong burden she placed on you. Until now, Sakura relied on you too much. This time, she intends to resolve
everything alone. Sai… Why are you telling me all this? Sasuke is the source of Naruto's agony. But aren't you a part of it too? It wasn't my intention, but I'm partly to blame for
provoking Sakura. That's why I told you. I couldn't ignore what Sakura's doing. And besides, I belong to Team 7. I see. Having learned all this,
Naruto must be in turmoil. Now then… What to do? There is something
you must hear immediately. We will tell you everything that happened
at the Five Kage Summit. It's been a long time, Danzo. We haven't met since
the Uchiha incident. Foo, Torune, assist me. I'm going to break the seal
on my right arm. Keep him occupied. So you're going for it, Danzo? Madara… His abilities are limitless. Be careful. – Yes, sir.
– Yes, sir. Torune, we'll back each other up
and attack. I know. Mind Transfer… He disappeared into the pillar. It seems he can slip
through objects after all. Well? Are you able to sense his chakra? No. He has completely disappeared. A Sensory-Type with Mind Transfer skills. A member of the Yamanaka Clan, huh? In order to protect himself, he de-materializes his body
at the moment of an attack and passes right through it. But he solidifies his body to make
physical contact when he attacks. We have to aim for the counterattack. That was a well thought out analysis. The counterattack must
be timed perfectly. We'll attack one after the other
and get him on the second stage. The first stage will be a diversion. I'll be the decoy. He's already seen through
my Mind Transfer Jutsu. We'll go with your jutsu. Got it. That technique… Torune… That jutsu… Now! This guy…
He just pretended to attack. Damn it. We fell for it! Hmm… A jutsu to flush in chakra
and destroy cells? How troublesome. Forgive me, Foo. I'll extract them right away. This isn't chakra. These are nano-sized venom beetles. They are almost like bacteria. Insects that devour cells on contact. I've heard of them. You are a ninja from the Aburame Clan who knows Hidden Ninjutsu. I see. You're the son
of Shikuro Aburame, the one with immunity to those insects. To think you were in the Foundation. Danzo! You have yourself a good subordinate. Forgive me, Torune. Don't blame yourself, Foo. Use your sensors to
locate him quickly. I'll get him the next time. Damn it! He sucked in Torune! My right arm has been injected
with the venom beetles. You're next. I see. Who would have thought the meeting
would become so intense. I guess with Danzo… I'm not too eager about
becoming the Hokage. And even if the situation
requires me to accept… I'll have to return to
Hidden Leaf Village first and hear what the others say. Madara has declared war on us! There's no time to deliberate. I'm sure everyone will approve. We should have them proceed
on the premise that you are the Hokage, Kakashi. If our response is delayed and the Akatsuki and Madara
take the advantage, that would be even worse. I guess you're right. Thanks. And Sasuke… For him to attack the summit… Naruto, this is a battle to protect
the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails. Namely you. And it's also for the ninja world. As the Kazekage,
I would give my life to protect you. If Sasuke Uchiha confronts the Allied Shinobi Forces
as a member of the Akatsuki, I will show no mercy. Sasuke, you and I are alike. We've both walked through
the darkness of this world. That's why you should be able to see
even the faintest glimmer of light. In the past and even now. I closed my eyes long ago. My goals exist only in the darkness. Sasuke doesn't care about you. All he wants is darkness. Naruto, you told me,
"I am going to be the Hokage." I have become the Kazekage. If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage, then do what is right
as Sasuke's friend. We've said everything we needed to say. Let's go, Gaara. We will return to our village. Kakashi Hatake… With the understanding that
you will be Hokage, the Sand will take action. As allied nations, I pray that there will be
no conflicting intel between us. Understood. I consider you my friend. In the past,
"friend" was merely a word to me. Nothing more, nothing less. But after meeting you,
you made me realize that… the meaning of that word
is what's important. What does it mean? What can you do for Sasuke?
Think hard about that. Let's go. Naruto… Let him find the answer himself. Here I am, all alone with Sasuke
in this dark place. Taking care of you while resisting
every urge in my body. Hurry up and get well! A-Are you all right, Sasuke? Cold as ever. He'll never change. But…still… Let me out of here. Don't be so hasty. I'll let you go. I have something for you outside. Sasuke Uchiha. You stay back. If you get involved, you'll die. Perfect. Sasuke… Madara… I'll take both your Sharingan. Let me ask one thing.

 Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated
my clan by order of the Elders?

 As I thought, you were special.

 Damn Itachi! I see he revealed everything
to you before he died.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Danzo's Right Arm"

 Don't say anymore about Itachi!
 
 Tune in again!

 I consider you my friend. In the past, "friend" was
merely a word to me. Nothing more, nothing less. But after meeting you,
you made me realize that… the meaning of that word
is what's important. What does it mean? What can you do for Sasuke? Think hard about that. Danzo… Just what kind of
jutsu does he use? W-What? That right arm… It has many Sharingan!
It's disgusting! How did you get those eyes
in your right arm? Through various means.
It would take too long to describe. Any explanation would upset me more. Forget it. I've decided to kill you. Before that, let me ask one thing. Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated
my clan by order of the Elders? This is… So that’s Sasuke's… So this is the Susano'o. Danzo's Right Arm

 So? What do we do now? In any case, I think we should
return to the Hidden Leaf and report what happened
at the summit. And also about Sakura. The real me is accompanying Sakura. She won't be allowed
to get near Sasuke! You can count on that. But it would be better to go
in person and talk her out of it. All right. Yamato, take Naruto and
head back to the village. I'll bring Sakura back. Sakura is no match for Sasuke. It would be like
she’s going there to die. I'll dispatch the Ninja Hounds
with a report about the summit since it's urgent. Understood. Sai… Take me to Sakura. Yes. What the hell do you guys want? You were just talking about Sasuke! Tell us what you were saying! It's got nothing to do with
you Cloud Ninja! It's got everything to do with us! Sasuke Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf
attacked our village! Your Rogue Ninja
abducted our master! We don't even know if our master
is dead or alive, you idiots! Th-That's a lie! Why would Sasuke do such a thing?! Like we'd know what
the Akatsuki's motives are! The Akatsuki? What do you mean? Huh? Don’t kid around. Sasuke is a member of
the Akatsuki! You guys let your Rogue Ninja
roam free, so Lord Raikage ordered us
to come here! And we've gotten your Hokage's permission
to get rid of the Uchiha! Sasuke abducted their master? We'll get our revenge! The Uchiha is ours! Itachi Uchiha… His life was one of
personal sacrifice. For the village and more importantly,
for his younger brother. Sasuke lost everything,
and he was left all alone, in exchange for peace
in Hidden Leaf Village. Can you still blame Sasuke? Sasuke said that he couldn’t forgive
the Hidden Leaf for sacrificing Itachi's life
to secure peace. He is doing everything out
of a desire for revenge. He is the real thing.
A true avenger. Hatred… It is Sasuke's Ninja Way! The Hidden Leaf will deal
with Sasuke. Every one of your comrades
is committed to that and will act accordingly. Sakura is not a fool. She’s not a child who
wouldn't understand the difficulty of the situation. Sakura intends to
kill Sasuke herself. If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage, then do what is right as Sasuke's friend. Naruto, is something wrong? Calm down, Naruto! He's hyperventilating. Breathe slowly. Naruto! Naruto…Can you hear me? Naruto? I'm going to ask you
one more time. Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated
my clan by order of the Elders? I'm asking if it's true! Answer me! I… I didn’t think he was
that kind of man. Damn Itachi. I see he revealed
everything to you before he died. As I thought… It seems that you are truly special. By making revenge your goal,
he hoped to make you strong. I acted like the older brother
you desired in order to measure your vessel. You will become a rival to
measure my vessel against. You have that hidden potential. You’ve been jealous of me
and resented me. You’ve harbored hopes
of surpassing me. That is why I am allowing you
to live. For my sake. My foolish little brother… If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me. And survive…in obscurity. Run…keep running…
and cling to life. Then one day, come before me with
the same eyes that I possess. The Uchiha is a proud clan
of the Hidden Leaf. He wanted you to keep believing that. He beseeched the Hokage
that you never learn the truth. And from the time he left the village, he was resolved to
fighting you and dying. You really have gotten stronger… Sasuke. So that he could instill in you
a new power. He accepted disgrace
in the place of honor, and hate in the place of love. And despite that, Itachi died with
a smile on his face. He entrusted the Uchiha name to you,
his younger brother, deceiving you to the very end. Lies! They’re all lies… Answer me! I… I didn't think Itachi was the kind
of man who would reveal secrets. Does that mean it's true? Self-sacrifice…
That’s what epitomizes a shinobi. Never seeing the light of day.
Toiling in the shadows. It is as it was in the past.
That is what a true shinobi is. It describes not only Itachi. Countless other ninja have
died the same way. Niceties alone will not make
the world go round. Peace was attained all
because of people like him. People like you who misunderstood
Itachi's intentions couldn't possibly understand. Still…for Itachi to reveal such
a secret to you makes him a traitor to the Leaf… Don’t say anymore about Itachi! You’re right. Then let us proceed
to a battle of the eyes. What's going on?! He should've died earlier! I can only sense chakra
from one Danzo. I'm certain it's not a clone! As expected…Susano'o. Just the thing to protect yourself. The power in its attack is as expected. Again? So if that wasn't
a clone either… Is it genjutsu?! Sasuke's inner chakra isn't disturbed. And my chakra is calm. If neither Sasuke nor I am
under a genjutsu… Then… what kind of jutsu is this? Amaterasu! Susano'o and even Amaterasu… That's too much just to
test Danzo's power. He'll tire himself out. Sasuke! Behind you! Wind Style: Vacuum Bullets! Sasuke! Summoning Jutsu! A new summoning jutsu? When did he get that? Amaterasu. It's been a while
since I last saw that. You are Itachi's younger brother after all. You’ve taken over Itachi's jutsu. I told you never to
speak of Itachi again! Brothers with the same ability. Yet, what your eyes perceive
is so different. The truth about Itachi
isn't important to you. You direct your hatred at whomever
you can lay your hands on. You make the sacrifice of
the Uchiha Clan meaningless. You have no right to talk
about the Uchiha! Wind Style: Vacuum Blast! Sasuke! This is… No way! It's useless. Th-This is… Itachi? Why did you hand over your life
for this child, Itachi?

 He misinterpreted your intentions,

 he charges ahead with only hatred
as his rationale. He is a fool.

 Look closely, Itachi,
this is your one and only mistake.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“The Forbidden Visual Jutsu”

 I will correct your mistake.

 It is finally time for me to be
in charge of a mini-corner! Now that I’m here,
I’m going to make sure you feel the passion, the friendship, the sweat,
the struggle, the gutsiness— Palm Heel Strike! At least you got to appear
in the main story. My situation’s getting worse and worse. I’ll be taking this mini-corner. I won’t let you do this by yourself. ADORABLE TENTEN

If we’re doing a mini-corner, why not feature me,
a cute, strong, and popular… Idiots! All of us have had
little screen time recently. We’re all in the same situation.
Am I right or not? Guy Sensei… Therefore… I will give you a hot, young,
and awesome mini-corner. I call it… You just want to show off! Who are you kidding?! …me Might Guy, with overflowing youth going at a great ultra-super full swing,
will bring everyone…

 Tune in again!

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,400
That's his real body. After twenty years,
what say we face each other? What took you so long? But I flew back as quickly
as I could. More to the point, you took too long to send over
a substitute border guard. Your planning was bad. That's no way to show
your appreciation. I carried out your selfish request
despite recovering from an illness. Well... Shall we get going? Yeah. Yes, sir! <i>It can still move?!</i> As I thought. Just what I'd expect
from my old granny. No wonder this little girl was able
to dodge my hidden weapons. After all, the old lady who can see
past my attacks was controlling the little girl with Chakra threads
used for the Puppet Master Jutsu. <i>He found out.</i> What's more, you were so kind as to
attach threads of Chakra to Hiruko's tail. But to think that I'd notice it after the tail's motion had been
brought to a halt... It was when you first attacked
with the Kunai Knife, wasn't it? Threads of Chakra attached
to the Kunai Knife latched onto the tail
when it repelled the Kunai Knife. I suppressed my Chakra as much
as possible so as not to be seen, and yet you still figured it out. I'm amazed. But of course. After all, the one who hammered
the principles of puppetry into me was... none other than you. Yes. But the show ends today. That is my intention as well. Well then, will things proceed
as simply as that, I wonder... Granny Chiyo...? Granny Chiyo? Is he... Is he Sasori? What is going on? <i>He's just as he was before...
<i>He hasn't aged a bit.</i> <i>What's going on?!</i> <i>I was told Sasori broke off from
<i>the Hidden Sand 20 years ago...</i> <i>There's no way that
<i>he could be this young.</i> <i>Sasori's Real Face


</i> Damn! <i>The sound that I heard coming
<i>from inside just a while ago...</i> <i>There's no doubt that
<i>the battle has already begun.</i> <i>I'd like to get a grasp
<i>of the situation, but...</i> You! Return Gaara to us! <i>It's only a matter of time</i> <i>before my man Sasori does away
<i>with the group inside.</i> <i>If my man comes out,</i> <i>then the whole point of using this one
<i>to draw out the Jinchuriki will be lost.</i> You jerk!
I won't let you get away. Hold it right there! Naruto, wait a minute! Kakashi Sensei,
you go look after Sakura! Good grief. Guy, how are conditions
over there? Sorry Kakashi, it looks like things
will still take a while over here. Rotation. If detaining someone is your objective,
there's no better way than this. If your opponent has exactly
the same abilities as you do... It probably won't be that easy
to bring matters to a close. Splendid move, Mr. Imposter. Damn... Looks like it's impossible to
expect back-up for a while. <i>Sakura, Granny Chiyo,
<i>hold down the fort a bit longer!</i> There's no way I'm going
to let you get away! They're coming, aren't they? Better keep up! And then,
I will settle matters properly... Stop! What's wrong, Kankuro? We'll rest here. What?! What do you think
you're doing, Kankuro?! There's no time to rest easy
in a situation like this! Don't be so impatient...
That's not like you, Sis. I'm sorry, Miss Temari. Just a little while...
If we rest just a little while, we'll be able to start
running again right away! Please let us rest a little while. You guys have no discipline.
And you call yourselves Shinobi?! Stop being unreasonable. These guys took turns guarding
the border for a whole day. And no sooner had they returned
to the village, they had to run all the way here... However top-notch Shinobi they may be, you can't force them to do
more than this. No, we're okay! We can't be resting while
Lord Gaara is in trouble! We should do what we can
for the Kazekage's sake! Yes, for the Kazekage's sake! Miss Temari! Let's head out. You guys! That's the spirit! Now, now,
you shouldn't get so fired up about it. Ebizo... A Shinobi should never lose
his composure under any circumstances. Forgetting that and pursuing
the enemy too far all by himself was the cause of
Kankuro's recent failure, wasn't it? Besides, in your current state, all of you are not being aware
of your surroundings. What do you mean by that...? Well, look at that. Th-That...?! That must be the remains of the battle
that Akatsuki fought with the Leaf. That means... Yes. You have to assume that
we have already entered their territory. There's no telling what kind of traps
they may have set up ahead. When you're about to set foot
in such a place, you'll be annihilated in no time
if you go dashing in, exhausted the way you all are now. This is just perfect. While you're resting, I'll tell you all
a story about the old days. It was long, long ago. I'm sure you must
have heard of it... The incident of the Third Kazekage. The Third...Kazekage? Yes... The one before
the previous Kazekage. Of all the Kazekage
down through history, the Third Kazekage was
said to be the most powerful. Then the incident occurred when
someone kidnapped the Kazekage. The entire village got all excited
and went out seeking news of what had become of
the Third Kazekage... Looking back upon it now, you would have to say
that they simply lost their cool. The village's guard wore thin, allowing the enemy to intrude,
and panic ensued. If they had dealt with it
a little more coolly at the time, the subsequent war
could have been avoided. I am painfully aware of how
you all feel right now... But...you mustn't repeat
the same mistakes that were made back in
the days of the Third Kazekage. Ebizo... did they ever learn what happened to
the Third Kazekage after that? After that, the Anbu Black Ops
continued to investigate in secret, but no body was ever found, nor any sign that the Kazekage
had been removed... What's wrong, Granny Chiyo? Are you so filled with emotion
that you cannot speak? That's not surprising. After all, it's our first reunion
in 20 years. Sasori, you... While I'm at it,
I'll show you something special. It's guaranteed to move you. A collection that gave me
a hard time when trying to kill it, but... Three? That's why I like this best of all. Th-That... It couldn't be! What? What's wrong?! That's...the Third Kazekage... What?! The Third...Kazekage? How about it? Doesn't that take you back,
Granny Chiyo? Granny Chiyo, the Third Kazekage...? How could this have happened? Then... It was over ten years ago that the Third Kazekage suddenly
disappeared from the village. We scoured the countryside,
but we were never able to find him. He was the most powerful
of all the Kazekage's, but... Sasori, you...? And so what if I did? Do you mean to say that a retired old lady
with one foot in the grave is about to avenge
the Third Kazekage? Tough luck... Retired, with one foot in the grave.
That may be so, but it was worth hauling
my heavy behind over here. I'd have too many regrets
if I were to die now. It's bad enough that my grandson got himself mixed up
with a bad crowd... but to think that you'd betray the village and try to meddle with the Kazekage,
for the third time! Third time? It was Orochimaru
who killed Gaara's father, the Fourth Kazekage, but... the one who guided them
was Sasori! And this time,
Gaara and even the Third Kazekage... Hey, hey, I don't know anything
about the Fourth Kazekage. The one who guided them
was my subordinate. In that case, it's the same
as if you did it yourself. Can you really say that
you were not involved? Indeed, I was originally paired with
Orochimaru back at the Akatsuki, so I did lots of things but... You... If you were paired
with Orochimaru... then that means you know
about Orochimaru. In that case, there're a lot
of questions I need you to answer! <i>Sakura...</i> Unfortunately,
I must take you two out and go capture that Jinchuriki. I hate to keep people waiting, so I have no time
to answer your questions. So... shall we get right to it? <i>Here it comes!</i> Die! <i>He's fast!</i> <i>To think that Hiruko's tail
<i>fell to pieces...</i> You've got some
pretty good moves, Granny Chiyo. In that case, how about this? Oh no! Take this! Sakura! <i>Damn. Did I botch it?</i> <i>Saved!</i> <i>With the old lady manipulating things,
<i>it's impossible to get anywhere.</i> In that case... Oh, no! Sakura! Hold your breath! <i>Is it poison?!</i> <i>In this poisonous smoke,
<i>your movements will be irrelevant.</i> Sakura--! <i>Guy Sensei, this is terrible!</i> <i>What is it, Lee?!</i> <i>According to the information
<i>received just now,</i> <i>Kakashi Sensei is the star
<i>of today's Mini Feature!</i> <i>What?! He gets a juicy deal like that
<i>while we're down here fighting?!</i> <i>In that case,</i> <i>we'll have to take these guys out
<i>quickly and join the show!</i> <i>Youth at full power!</i> <i>No way, we can't make it...</i> <i>Hard effort will pay off!
<i>Right, Tenten?</i> <i>Huh? Where's Tenten?!</i> <i>She just left all excited,
<i>saying she got selected as the MC!</i> Next time: "Chiyo's Secret Skills"
<b>
  
  
<i>Say what--?! That traitor!</i></b> No way! It’s useless. Th-This is… Itachi? The Forbidden Visual Jutsu

 Die… Amaterasu! I commend you for placing me
under genjutsu. However… Sasuke! Now's your chance! Why did you stop? I was aware of your genjutsu
long ago. It is a far cry from
Itachi's masterful Tsukuyomi in which he freely manipulated time. A Curse Mark that paralyzes the body. He must have placed it back then. Sasuke… You can't move? I don't need to use jutsu on her. Taijutsu, huh? It seems he wants to
preserve his chakra. Release! The flow of Danzo's chakra
has changed. What's he up to? If Sasuke knows the truth
about Itachi, then the Akatsuki must know as well. It's impossible to try to conceal
the information any longer. Why? Why was it necessary to save
the life of such trash, Itachi? Sasuke! Look, Itachi… at the sorry state he’s in. He’s your…ultimate mistake. But he could not kill…
his little brother. He cried tears of blood and killed every shred of feeling
he had inside him, then he killed his brethren
for the sake of his village. But he just couldn’t kill you. Do you understand what
that means? To him,  your life was more precious… than the village. He broke free from the Curse Mark. Is that Susano'o? It's completely different from before! Is this Sasuke?! This chakra… He's no longer the Sasuke
from before. All right. His hatred has matured
and gained in power. And his body is responding to it. This is going well. He doesn’t need my help at all. He's aiming for my landing. I can't weave the signs in time! It can't be helped! I managed to alter its path. Danzo's chakra level
plummeted with that jutsu! Why did he go to that extent
just to dodge Susano'o's attack? The jutsu this guy's been using
is supposed to make him immortal. So the jutsu he released
earlier was his own. That was Wood Style. I see. So that's why… With that many Sharingan, I knew there had to be a secret for someone not from the Uchiha
to be able to use them. Damn Orochimaru… It seems he and Danzo
have been in close contact. He had the cells of
the First Hokage, Hashirama, implanted in him to enhance
his physical energy. That's how he was able
to control so many Sharingan. No, he can die! If he hadn’t countered that
earlier attack, he would have died. That's why he exhausted
so much chakra! Sasuke! That's the real Danzo! The jutsu that makes him invincible
is broken right now! He's vulnerable! So that woman’s a Sensory-Type Ninja! She figured me out. But it's too late. Yes! No… The moment Danzo weaved a sign, something about
his chakra changed. He activated the jutsu! I’m probably the only one
who can see that. Susano'o's attack just then
was probably too late. Damn it! He recast the jutsu again, but all three eyes are still closed. As far as I can tell,
he has ten Sharingan in his arm, as well as the First Hokage's cells. The power of the Uchiha
and Hashirama. Looks like he intends
to control the Nine-Tails. So he's after Naruto too. Danzo's chakra level has
decreased some more. This jutsu carries a lot of risk
after all. That’s why he needed to
undo the jutsu once before. Release! In order to preserve his chakra! And another thing. The Sharingan in his right arm
and his jutsu are definitely linked. The secret lies in the eyes that close! There’s no mistake. This is the Visual Jutsu that was forbidden
even among the Uchiha. Izanagi… I didn’t expect to see it here,
of all places. Sasuke! Stay calm! The only thing I can do right now
is analyze Danzo's jutsu! Izanagi… Where in a brief moment in time, anything disadvantageous
to the user of the jutsu, like damage or death,
can be rewritten as a dream. And… anything advantageous,
such as the user’s attacks, is kept as part of reality. The ability to control the space
between fantasy and reality. An ultimate genjutsu cast upon oneself. And the eye that uses
Izanagi loses its light, never to open again. But… The number of eyes
he possesses… The duration of Izanagi varies
with each user. He wanted to extend the time
by whatever means so he agreed to become
a test subject for Orochimaru. Damn that Madara… It doesn't seem like
he plans to join the battle, but I cannot take any chances. I must reserve enough power
to take him on. It will take some time for the right eye I used
at the summit to recover. However, this Susano'o
is not easy to deal with. That arrow attack is difficult to dodge. And I can’t undo Izanagi yet. I’ll have to bet on this next minute. Summoning Jutsu! This Summoning… It’s the Baku.
A monster that devours nightmares. It's much larger than I imagined. I will not lose sight of Danzo! No matter what! With this, Susano'o won't
be able to move. I’ll take advantage of
the Baku's suction power to increase the force. Wind Style: Vacuum Blast Barrage! The vulnerable spot
in Susano’o… is here! Fire Style… Fire Ball Jutsu! Using Fire Style in this situation… You made clever use of the wind
that was being inhaled, Sasuke. 53…54…55… 56…57…58…59…60. Those eyes… One closes every 60 seconds or so. And during that time,
his chakra continues to drop drastically. Which means… that right arm shows how much time
that weird jutsu has left. Four more left! Or roughly 240 seconds, approximately four minutes
is the time limit of that jutsu! While his jutsu is active, Sasuke's attacks are
made ineffective while Danzo's attacks are successful. The way this jutsu works… Danzo intends to bring Sasuke down
while his jutsu is still active. Even with a mutual strike,
Danzo will win! Sasuke! I figured out
a little bit of that guy's jutsu! Listen! All right? When all ten of your eyes
have closed on your right arm, your jutsu will be undone,
isn't that so? You knew about Izanagi? As I suspected! You tricked me? What a crafty brat. Y-You fool!
Why are you engaging him? Sasuke! Get away from him now! Prolong the battle! However, that wouldn't make sense. In that case, Danzo would
simply undo Izanagi. If that happens, Sasuke,
who’s used up so much strength, would be at
an overwhelming disadvantage. Sasuke is pressing Danzo with the super-fast,
high-powered Susano’o to force him to continue using
Izanagi and thus use it up. Sasuke figured this out early on. Now, who will be exhausted first? He's putting his remaining strength
into a chakra blade. This is the deciding moment. How many Uchiha did you kill
to get that right arm?! It was Itachi who enabled me to get it. You made him do it! Shisui’s eye has recovered at last.

 Nevertheless, Sasuke is no longer
useful with that injury.

 As I thought,
 
 Madara’s the one I need to place
under genjutsu and manipulate.

 I can’t waste time
since I have sustained injuries too.

 I can’t die yet.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Danzo Shimura"

 I win.

 Tune in again!

 Danzo Shimura

 I guess this is the extent
of Sasuke’s power. You were too hasty.
My eye is still open. Go to Itachi so he can lecture you. I win. What's going on?! This feels like… You may think you've seen
through Izanagi… What is the meaning of this? Why won’t Izanagi activate? Danzo, as you said, Sasuke's genjutsu
is a far cry from Itachi’s. You insolent… You're the one who's going
to see Itachi. Just as I thought,
this one is the real Danzo! It’s a far cry from Itachi’s Tsukuyomi, in which he freely manipulated time
within a genjutsu. But the trick lies in how you use even a short, weak genjutsu. With Izanagi, a Sharingan is cast away
once its use is exhausted. One eye will keep the jutsu active
for 60 seconds. However… Y-You fool!
Why are you engaging him? It may have seemed suicidal, but Sasuke's relentless attacks
were intended to to completely shut down
Danzo's Sharingan one by one. He knew exactly what he was doing. That is why… just before they exchanged blows, every Sharingan on his right arm
had already shut. Sasuke is an Uchiha. And he is a ninja who possesses
the Mangekyo Sharingan. His skills of observation,
Danzo, are keener than yours. In an instant,
before you were even aware, Sasuke placed a genjutsu on you
and made you believe that the last eye on your right arm
was still open. You yourself were concerned about the instability of
the Izanagi’s duration and kept checking the Sharingan
on your right arm. Sasuke did not miss that. Very subtly, he wanted
to make you think the Izanagi would last a little longer. He had already confirmed that
he could place you under genjutsu, even if it was just for an instant. And Sasuke seized that opportunity. Because you also possess the Sharingan, you underestimated how
to use it in battle. Your arrogance led to your defeat. Now that’s battling with your eyes. Don't underestimate the Uchiha. Danzo didn't get to use Shisui's eye, but you pressed him
into a corner, Sasuke. Looks like I’ll be able to take
Shisui’s eye soon. The Foundation should have
stayed hidden underground. Sasuke! Are you all right? Hurry up and bite! Bringing that woman was
a wise decision. She's useful. I see why Sasuke chose her. How could I…of all people…
lose to this brat?! I can’t die here yet! No, at this rate, I’ll be taken over
by the First Hokage’s cells! He's near death and he’s losing
the ability to control chakra. Hashirama's power is
not easy to control. What a persistent guy! Not yet… This is where we battle with our eyes. The visual prowess in
his right eye has returned. I see. He intended to use Izanagi
until Shisui's eye recuperated. Shisui's visual prowess… He's trying to decide whether
to use it for genjutsu, or sacrifice it for the Izanagi. You used your visual prowess
too much, didn’t you? Sasuke… Sasuke is no longer useful. As I thought, Madara’s the one
I need to place under genjutsu and manipulate. I can’t waste time, my wound is deep. Now then, Sasuke.
What will you do? Isn't it ironic that you,
who glorified self-sacrifice, would take a hostage? It's not that I consider my life precious. But for the sake of Hidden Leaf Village…
for the ninja world… I cannot afford to die here. No matter what the means,
I must survive. For I will be the one reformer
who will change this ninja world. This woman will be sacrificed
for that cause. Sasuke help! Don't move…Karin. A vital point… Right through the hostage! That’s what I wanted to see. Brother… One down. You didn't have time to cast Izanagi,
did you, Danzo? Sasuke… What was I… …to you? Karin… Since you managed to
get taken hostage, you’re nothing but a burden to me. Sasuke… Danzo… I'm taking Shisui's eye. Is Itachi here? We need to talk, come out! What brings you all here? There were two people who didn’t
show up at yesterday’s assembly. Why didn’t you come? We understand that joining
the Anbu Black Ops means being pushed to do all sorts
of petty assignments. Your father has said as much
and tries to defend you. But we have no intention of
giving you special treatment. I understand.
I shall be more careful hereafter. Now, I’m going to have
to ask you to leave. All right. But before that, we’d like to ask you a bit more
about something. It’s about Shisui Uchiha who died after throwing himself into
the Nakano River last night. He took Shisui's eye? Are you all right, Danzo? Why'd you interfere, Hiruzen?! Don't say that. We don't want to lose comrades
in a situation like this. You're alive! Kagami! Torifu! Yeah, I managed somehow. There are too many of them.
What'll we do, Hiruzen? Yeah, you're right. We should meet up with
the Second Hokage. We're surrounded. There are… 20 of them. Judging from their tracking skills, I'd say they're from
the Hidden Cloud. The highly skilled Kinkaku Unit. There are seven of us including you,
Lord Hokage. We're completely outnumbered. Homura! Don't be such a coward. The enemy hasn't pinpointed
our position yet. We should lie in wait until we can find
an opportunity to break through. It's no use, Koharu. One of us will have to
divert their attention. A decoy? It means certain death. So who? I am a shinobi. I’ve made up my mind to die on
the battlefield like a proper shinobi. Sarutobi… What are you thinking now? Are you prepared to make
that sacrifice? Go ahead! Say it! That I’ll… What's the matter? Why can't I say it? I will go! Sarutobi… Hiruzen, you… Don't worry! I may not look it, but I know
I’m better than any of you. I won't die. My trembling…stopped. Damn it! I'm such a coward. Somewhere deep inside my heart, I feel relieved. Look after the others, Danzo.
I know you’ll— Shut up! I was planning on volunteering! Don't try to steal the spotlight!
I'll be the decoy! Danzo… My father and grandfather both died
on the battlefield as shinobi. Self-sacrifice is a shinobi's duty! No, I will go and be the decoy, of course. You all are the young Wills of Fire that will be defending our village
in the future. No! You are the Hokage! There is no greater shinobi in
the village than you! Danzo, you are always competing
with Saru over one thing or another, but what's necessary here is for you to unite and work together
as comrades. Do not make this a personal fight. The fact is, you took too long
to reach a decision. You must first look at yourself rationally
and know yourself. Otherwise, at this rate,
you will place your comrades in danger. In any case, Danzo and Saru… You two are still young,
so don't be hasty. Your time will come. Until that time, stay alive. Saru… Protect those who love the village
and those who believe in you. And nurture those to whom
you can entrust the next generation. Starting tomorrow, you are the Hokage! Saru… Take care of the Hidden Leaf! Yes, sir! You always get ahead of me! For the sake of the ninja world…
for sake of the Hidden Leaf… I will not let you both live! This is the Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu. Sasuke! Get away from Danzo! Hiruzen, it's my turn next. Where the tree leaves dance,
one shall find flames. The fire’s shadow will illuminate
the village. And once again tree leaves
shall bud anew. Just as you gave your life to
protect the Hidden Leaf. This time, I will. I cannot allow these men… But in the end,
I could not become the Hokage. No matter how far I ran,
I could never catch up to you. You were a tree leaf
upon which light shone. I was nothing but a foundation
hidden in darkness. What do you think of someone like me? Hiruzen… What was I to you? I wonder when I started liking Sasuke.

 I never thought about who he really
was behind that pensive face.

 I’m sorry Naruto, I let you bear
the burden all on your own.

 But also, thank you!

 I already decided!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“Sakura’s Resolve”

 I hope I get there in time!

 Tune in again!

 Sakura… What is it? Perhaps it would have been
better to tell Naruto the truth. There's no way
I could have told him. Absolutely no way. Sakura… You're underestimating Naruto. I found Sasuke. That Tobi guy is next to him. Stop, everyone! What's wrong? Why did you stop? We already went over our formation. Kiba… What is Sasuke's precise location? Facing directly north,
he's at 2 o'clock. Up one kilometer. Okay. Forgive me, everyone! I knew it.
You were going to use this to make everyone fall asleep,
weren't you? Sai! Huh?! What's going on? Sakura was going to take care
of Sasuke herself. Why would you go alone? Yes, why?
We promised to do it together! No, you can't. I won't let anyone proceed. Why not? You… I always thought
you were suspicious. The four of us alone are no match
against Sasuke or this Tobi. I promised Kakashi Sensei that
I wouldn't let any of you go. What? Is that the reason? Sai… I'll say this only once. Move aside. We must hurry. It's becoming
a rather dire situation. No. I won't let you go. Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll! You're going to bind us
with those snakes? I understand where
Kakashi Sensei's coming from, but we just can't keep
letting Sasuke go. I'll take care of him! Why not, Akamaru?!
Don't be so scared! The dog is smarter. It seems he understands
what I'm saying. Shut up! Let's go, Lee. Sure thing! Yeah! I'll take care of this
with Tunneling Fang! Good diversion, Kiba! Here! Damn it! I'm sorry…everyone. Kiba and Lee too. She got us. Please hurry! I'm impressed, Sakura. Sakura's Resolve

 Sasuke… When did I fall in love
with you? Back in those days, I was just infatuated with
how cool you were. Listen up, everyone! I'm in love! Who do you think it is? Keep it brief. And don't say it's Sasuke. How did you know? Next, Team 7. Sakura Haruno, Naruto Uzumaki. Yes! And Sasuke Uchiha. Cha! Then…you became my teammate. I'm Sakura Haruno. What I like...
I mean, who I like is... My future dream is... On Team 7. Today's assignment is to take these bells away
from me by noon. Those who can't do it
won't get lunch. Here. H-Hey, Sasuke.
Sensei just said… It's okay.
There's no sign of him now. In the afternoon, the three of us
will go and get the bells. It'll be trouble for me
if he becomes a hindrance, so... Sasuke… What?! You guys! You pass. We passed?! Why?! A ninja must see through deception. In the ninja world, those who break
the rules are scum. But those who abandon
their friends are worse than scum. Being teammates didn't change me. I was still hopelessly in love
with the cool Sasuke. Just gazing at his handsome profile
was enough for me. I never gave a thought to who he really was behind
that pensive face. But… Sasuke will definitely come
looking for me… in search of power. You! What did you do to Sasuke? I gave him a parting gift. Sasuke! S-Sasuke?! Hang on, Sasuke! Please! At last I understand.
I'm an avenger. With the path I'm on,
I must acquire power at any price, even if it means being
consumed by evil. You're the only one left. Make it a little more fun for me. Stop! Stop it, please! Don't say anything about
this bruise. Why are you pretending
to be tough? I don't want to watch you suffer
all the time anymore! To me, you are… This has nothing to do with you! Mind your own business. Sasuke! The shadow that you carried… When I finally noticed,
it was too late. W-What?! Fight me… Right now! This is perfect, I was just thinking
that I wanted to fight you! Damn it! Stop it, both of you! That Chidori you used earlier… It was bigger than what
you'd normally direct at a comrade from the same village. Were you thinking of killing Naruto? Naruto knew…
He knew about your shadow. Sakura… Don't interfere. Before I knew it, Naruto had matured and was
standing face-to-face with you. I was the one left behind.
Yet I didn't change. I'm not the same as you. I'm traveling a path the rest
of you can't follow. I love you so much, Sasuke! If you stay with me, I won't let you regret it,
no matter what! Everyday will be fun
and we'll be happy! I'll even help you get revenge! I'll make it happen somehow,
I promise you!  So please… Stay here with me. And if you can't… take me with you. You're still annoying. Please… Please bring Sasuke back. I'll bring Sasuke back without fail! I promise that on my life! I didn't think about it and
I put the entire burden on Naruto. I went crying to you. I held onto you, expecting you
to make it all better. While I did nothing. That's why this time… I'm sorry, Naruto. You may have to wait for me
a little bit. Next time I'm coming with you. I tried to catch up to the two of you
in my own way. But Sasuke… is no longer
the person we think he is and he's far beyond our reach. It doesn't matter, even if there's no promise
between us anymore. I personally want to save Sasuke. Forget it! I'm going back. Naruto… I'm sorry! But also…thank you. But I've already decided.
I'll take care of Sasuke myself! That was a close call. For the sake of the ninja world…
for sake of the Hidden Leaf… I will not let you both live! This is the Reverse Tetragram
Sealing Jutsu. Sasuke! Get away from Danzo! That was the Collateral Damage
Sealing Jutsu. He would've dragged you into
his corpse and sealed you inside. He probably set it up to activate
at the moment of his death. That was close. We'll head for Hidden Leaf Village next. The Hidden Leaf, huh? I'm taking his eye. Sasuke, don't be hasty.
Go back to the hideout and rest. You used up too much of
your visual prowess. Eventually you won't be
able to keep it up. Your eye is losing its light. What can you do by yourself now? Patience is necessary
to reach one's goal. Sasuke… I'm going to give you a bit of advice. That woman… If you don't need her,
make sure you finish her off. She knows too much about us. "Us"? When did I join you? Well, nevermind. We'll meet again. EARTH Hey! Where is everyone?! Lion's Barrage! An Earth Scroll, just like us, huh? M-My glasses! – Later.
– Later. I wish I could've seen your face
from back then, just one more time. Sasuke! It's you, Sakura. He feels totally different. Is this really Sasuke? What are you doing here? Who is she? Sasuke! I'm coming with you!
I'm deserting the Hidden Leaf! You're finally awake, Naruto?

 Where am I?

 You lost consciousness.
You really had us worried.

 Captain Yamato,
where are Kakashi Sensei and Sai?

 Did they leave already?

 You're going back to
the village with me.

 Kakashi's orders.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Lost Bonds"

 You just have to let Kakashi
handle Sakura.

 What?! The champion got
knocked out in one round? Damn it, how pathetic! He lacks fighting spirit,
fighting spirit! WAYS TO MAKE A GIRL'S HEART STIR

 WAYS TO MAKE A GIRL'S HEART STIR

…get close to their ear and whisper. I understand now! Hey there… When you punch, you have to put your back
into it and strike! Oh Sai! I'm so sorry, are you okay? It wasn't on purpose! Get a hold of yourself! NICE TREASURE

 NICE TREASURE

So the featured pinup is sealed huh? Man, this is bugging me! Damn it, there's gotta be
a way I can see it. Byakugan! Sai! Yeah right, like I can use that. I guess I have no other choice. Hey Sai! C'mon, get up! Let me see. The contents that made me
so curious are… What the hell is this?! How is this a "Nice Treasure"?
I want my money back! Tune in again!

 Lost Bonds

 Don't all those things we did
together in Squad 7 mean anything to you?! No… It wasn't meaningless. To me, you became… my closest friend. I became your friend? Then why? That's precisely why. That's precisely why… you're worth killing. You're finally awake? A dream? Where am I? You lost consciousness. You really had us worried. Where are Kakashi Sensei and Sai? I see. Why? Why did it turn out like this? Naruto… You should rest a bit longer. Come on. Sasuke…you're… Did you hear?
Everyone in the Uchiha Clan got killed. Yeah, I know.
I heard my dad talking about it. He's the only one who survived. I was sorta glad back then. I wasn't the only one
who was alone anymore. But Sasuke was good
at everything he did. Good job, Sasuke! Just what I'd expect from Sasuke! He's so cool! He's showing off!
I can do that too! He was so different from me. Go! That's why I picked him
to be my rival, because I wanted to
become like him. Even though we were both on Squad 7, Sasuke was always
one step ahead of me. The reason why I trained so hard
was because I wanted to catch up to him,
even just a little. "Am I strong?"
All I want is the answer to that. I just wanted to fight the strong ones. And they are all right here. Naruto… I want to fight you too. I was really happy. It was the first time Sasuke
acknowledged me as an equal. First off, let's have you guys
introduce yourselves. But he… My name's Sasuke Uchiha. I have lots of dislikes,
but no likes in particular. And I don't feel like summing up
my ambition as just a dream, but I do have an ambition. The ambition to restore my clan and to kill a certain man
without fail! It's been a long time…Sasuke. Itachi Uchiha… I will kill you! This is the guy
Sasuke talked about, the man he wants to kill? It's just as you said… I've hated you…
and resented you. For the singular purpose
of killing you, I… I… have lived my life! You decided to live for revenge. My classified mission was indeed
the assassination of Sasuke. But I've had enough of orders. I now want to act
on my own beliefs. I think Naruto will get me
to remember… my past emotions. I don't know you very well. But there must be
some kind of reason Naruto and Sakura have pursued
you so desperately. They don't want to sever
their bonds with you. They're giving it their all
to secure those bonds. I still don't understand it
all that clearly. But Sasuke, you should understand. Yeah, I did understand. That's why I severed the bonds.
I have a different bond. A bond of hatred with
my older brother. What about the bond
between Sasuke and me? Hurry up! Before that, put your headband on.
I'll wait. I don't need that thing. Just do it! You won't even be able to put
a scratch on my forehead! That's not it! I'm saying this is a testament to fighting on equal terms
as Leaf Ninja. And I'm saying you're acting
high and mighty! Do you really think that we're equals?! Yeah, I do! I've never once thought that
I was inferior to you! You're an embarrassment! That's because you're still weak,
Little Sasuke! Naruto! Sasuke! Stop it, both of you. Stop it! Stop it, both of you! Damn! I can't stop completely! Lord Orochimaru has already
acquired the Immortality Jutsu. "Immortal" doesn't mean that
his flesh can maintain itself forever. Before his body decays, a strong, new body must be made
into a vessel for his soul. That's… Are you saying that's Sasuke?! Yes… That's right. I won't let that happen! When Sasuke abandoned the village, I really believed
I could bring him back. But… Have you snapped out of it yet? You have no siblings or parents. How could you understand
anything about me?! You've been on your own
since the beginning! What makes you think
you know anything about me? Having that bond is
what makes it painful! And how could you know what it feels like
to lose that bond?! In the end,
I didn't understand Sasuke at all. I just thought I knew him. Why? Why would you go
so far for me? Because this is the first bond
that I've ever had! That's why I'm gonna stop you. I admit it, you're strong. It's because you know the pain
that solitude brings, just as I do. And it's that pain that
makes people stronger. And for that very reason,
if I break that bond, I'll be able to achieve
even greater strength. Did you know that this place
is called the Final Valley? Don't you think this is
a perfect stage for us, Naruto? You… So let's bring this fight
to a close soon! How are you feeling? I had them make some porridge. Eat it and restore your strength. I…was dreaming about Sasuke. You're going back to
the village with me. They're Kakashi's orders. I'm sorry, but you just have to
let Kakashi handle Sasuke. Got it? Fine. Let me rest some more,
then we can head back to the village. You should eat a little
to restore your strength. I don't have an appetite. Sasuke said he was going to sever
his bond with me and become stronger. He said I could never
understand his feelings. You were friends with Orochimaru
long ago, right, Pervy Sage? Why did Orochimaru desert the village and decide to destroy
the Hidden Leaf? Orochimaru changed after
his parents were killed. He became obsessed
with Forbidden Jutsu. Maybe he longed to see his parents, or he sought revenge
on the Leaf Village, who he held responsible
for their deaths. My parents weren't killed. So like you, I was accused of
not being able to understand. Perhaps he was right,  I didn't understand
a thing about him. However… even I can see there's too much
hate in our Ninja World. Hate? And I've wanted to do
something about this hatred, but I'm not sure what
must be done. But I have faith that there will come a time when people can truly
understand one another. To me, Pervy Sage was irreplaceable.
He was family. That's why… Jiraiya-boy has died in battle. When I heard that Pervy Sage died, I understood what Sasuke was
talking about for the very first time. About the pain of losing a bond. Naruto, let's go soon.
Are you still not ready? I don't feel like going outside yet. Can you wait a bit longer? All right. He still hasn't caught on
that I'm a Shadow Clone. Have you come to understand
a little of what pain is? Unless you know the same pain,
you cannot truly know another. And even if you get to know others,
there can be no understanding. That is the truth. Just like how it's useless
to chase after Sasuke. People change… Sasuke isn't the old Sasuke anymore. Sasuke chose this himself. You must forget about Sasuke. If you are a ninja, become wiser. Fools cannot survive in our world.
That is the reality. If being smart means
what you say, I'll remain a fool for
the rest of my life. Pervy Sage, I'm a big fool after all. Kakashi Sensei's chakra… This way! Sakura, don't do anything reckless. This is just an assumption
on my part. But I believe Sakura… She intends to kill Sasuke herself. Sasuke has shouldered
the entire burden of the Uchiha's hatred and intends to strike
the world with that curse. It is the most powerful weapon. It's his friend and source of power,
this thing called hatred. And it is Sasuke's Ninja Way! Did you know, Naruto? When two shinobi are of
a high enough level, they are able to read
each other's thoughts, simply by an exchange of fists. Without ever uttering
a single word. You're naïve, Naruto. Tell me, could you read… my true feelings? Sasuke… Right now… I understand how you feel as
someone who has lost a bond. You said earlier you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother. What if Sasuke were to attack
the Leaf Village? What would you do then? What? Why would Sasuke…? There's no way he'd do
something like that! Sasuke is still naïve.
He can easily be dyed any color. Would you be able to stop him? Even if you had to kill Sasuke? Could you weigh Sasuke
against the Leaf Village on a set of scales? I would defend the Leaf Village! But I would also stop Sasuke
without killing him! You're such a child. What you speak of are
all fantasies. A ninja must sometimes
make very harsh decisions. The Akatsuki will be branded
as wanted fugitives. Then, not only I, but the whole world will
hunt Sasuke down. Yet you bow your head
for this criminal and plead for mercy for your friend. In the ninja world,
that is not friendship! If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage, then do what is right
as Sasuke's friend. I don't know what
the right thing to do is. However… Boy from the Hidden Leaf,
think hard on what you must do! The ninja world does not indulge fools! I consider you my friend. In the past, "friend" was
merely a word to me. Nothing more, nothing less. But after meeting you,
you made me realize that the meaning of that word
is what's important. What does it mean? What can you do for Sasuke?
Think hard about that. Sasuke… If I see you… If we meet, I think
I'll know the answer. Sakura, you don't have to shoulder
that burden yourself.

 It was my cowardice that
split all of you up.

 I must have been trying to
convince myself

 that it could be like
the old days again.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Burden"

 I'm sorry I was such
a careless teacher.

 Tune in again!

 Oh boy… Hey… Where's Sakura? Huh? Oh… You were going
after Sasuke, right? So which way did Sakura go? North…towards two o'clock. About one kilometer. That Sakura… Looks like she learned how to
concoct a powerful drug from Lady Tsunade. They won't be getting up for a while. There we go. Sorry, there's no time
so I'm going on ahead. What’s in it for me if
you come along? What are you plotting? I'm not plotting anything! Ever since you left
the Hidden Leaf Village, I've regretted not going with you! Is she an old teammate? And she’s also in love
with Sasuke? But… I'll do whatever you want. I don't want to have any more regrets. And do you know what I want? I don't care!
I'll do whatever you ask. I'm going to destroy the Hidden Leaf! That's what I want! Will you really be able betray
the Hidden Leaf for me? Yes. If you asked me to. Then prove it. Finish her off. Then I'll believe you. Who is she? A member of the group,
Taka, which I founded. As you can see, she's useless. Sakura, you're a Medical Ninja, right? You can replace her.
This will work out just fine. How could he?
He's definitely not the old Sasuke. He's completely changed. Well, Sakura? You can’t do it? She has nothing to do with this. If I… If I stab Sasuke now… it will all be over. Stop, Sasuke. He really meant to kill her. How you’ve fallen, Sasuke. One after another. Sakura, you tried to kill Sasuke
by yourself, didn't you? You don't have to shoulder
such a heavy burden by yourself. I was the leader of Team 7. It was my cowardice that
split all of you up. Sakura… I said something irresponsible to you in an effort to put you at ease. Kakashi Sensei… Don’t worry.
It will be like it was before! I must have been trying to
convince myself of that too. I’m sorry I’m such
a careless Sensei. But you’re… Sasuke… I don't like to
repeat myself. But I'll say this once more. I've seen so many guys
like you, I've lost count. Those who follow the path
of revenge end up nowhere. Do not become possessed
by vengeance! Itachi… My father… My mother… My entire clan!
Bring them all here! Do that and I’ll quit right now! I don't want to kill you. You talk like you could kill me
at any time! Stop acting like
you’re still my Sensei. I'm itching to kill you… Kakashi. He’s been completely twisted
by Madara. Sakura… Heal that girl to the point
that she can speak. We still have time right now. She knows a lot of intel
about the enemy. What about you, Sensei? Take that girl and
get away from here. Kakashi Sensei… I will take on what would
have been your burden. I guess you could say
it's my responsibility. All right? Hurry and go, Sakura. As the leader of Team 7,
I will settle this once and for all. I don't like repeating myself either. But stop acting like
you’re my Sensei. No matter how far he had fallen, he was still dear to you, wasn't he? Third Hokage… Even though you had nurtured
many other fine pupils… A cherished student
abandons the village. The agony of having to face
that dear student in battle. No one can begin to imagine
the resolve it took. Now I finally understand how
the Third Hokage must have felt. You will go the same way
as the Third Hokage! The Burden

 You… Don’t talk yet! Just a little longer. You’re the enemy,
I don’t want to know how you feel. So…stop crying in front of me… with such a sad face! Damn it. All right. The Sharingan is proof of
being an Uchiha. A lowlife ninja who isn't an Uchiha… has no right showing off that eye! The path of those shuriken… Sasuke is used to real combat! Well then… Earth Style: Mud Wall! For someone whose
Sharingan is borrowed, you're quite skilled in using it. However, can your Sharingan do this? I will show you… that my Sharingan is in
a completely different class than yours! This is… So fast. If I hadn't blown it away
with the Mangekyo, I'd be dead right now. So that's the Susano'o? To think that someone
who’s not an Uchiha could awaken the Mangekyo. So it seems that eye’s power
saved you. You should be grateful to
the power of the Uchiha. Sasuke… You are more than just your clan.
More than just hatred. Look deep inside your heart.
One more time. Are you still going on about that? Deep down, you know. You’re all laughing. They're all laughing. You’re laughing at
the cost of Itachi’s life! Laughing together,
completely ignorant of everything! Your laughing voices
sound like contempt and mocking to me now! I will change those laughs
to screams and wails! Sasuke… Sasuke's chakra…
has gotten even colder. Sasuke isn't the Sasuke
you knew anymore. This is bad! How’s this? So can your borrowed Sharingan
extinguish that?! I will show you the difference
between the real thing and a fake! Damn it! My sight! What is she going to do? Sakura! Why are you here? Don’t! I won't let Kakashi Sensei
bear the burden! Do you think Naruto will
calmly accept our decision? But this is something
we all decided. We have to make him understand. I'll talk to Naruto about everything. You, Sakura? Do you have a plan that'll work? Just leave everything to me. How can I tell Naruto
something like this?! I have to take care of this. I have to stay committed. Hey! Can you let me through? Get outta the way, Naruto! I want to sit over there. Sasuke… Mind if I sit next to you? I'm going to get Sasuke today! I’ll be the one to get
the first kiss! Cha! I'll give you guys
one more chance! However, after noon it'll be
a harsher battle to take the bells! Those who want to take
on the challenge can eat lunch. However, don't let Naruto have any. It's punishment for breaking
the rules and attempting to eat lunch
on your own. If someone lets him eat that person will be disqualified
on the spot. I make the rules here. Got it?! Here. H-Hey, Sasuke.
Sensei just said… It's okay.
There's no sign of him now. In the afternoon, the three of us
will go and get the bells. It'll be trouble for me if
he becomes a hindrance, so… Sasuke… Sakura… Thanks. You guys! You pass! You guys are the first. Up until now,
I only had dunces who would just meekly listen
to what I said. A ninja must see
through deception. In the ninja world, those who
break the rules are scum. But those who abandon
their friends are worse than scum. That's it for the exercise.
Everyone passes. Why are you hanging around
a place like this in the middle of the night? It’s because you use this path
to leave the Village. I always… Go home and sleep. Why won’t you tell me anything? Why are you always silent? You won’t tell me one single thing. I’m telling you to keep
your nose out of my business. Stop fussing over everything I do. I always… end up making
you hate me, don’t I? Do you remember? We just made genin and
the three-man squads were assigned. You and I were alone
for the first time, here in this very spot. You got mad at me. Solitude… It isn’t the same as being sad because your parents
scolded you. What’s the matter all
of a sudden? You…are annoying. I don’t remember that. Yeah, I guess. That was long ago after all. But it all began that day. You and me… And also Naruto and
Kakashi Sensei. The four of us went on
various missions. Those were tough and
difficult times, but… But more than anything,
it was so much fun. I know about your clan, Sasuke. But revenge that won’t bring
anyone happiness. No one. Neither you nor I. As I expected. I’m different
from you guys. I’m walking a road that’s incompatible
with the rest of you. The four of us worked together… and it’s true that there was
a time when I thought that was my road. The four of us worked together, but in the end,
I decided on revenge. That’s been my reason for living. I can’t be like you or Naruto. Are you going to isolate
yourself again, Sasuke?! Back then, you taught me
that solitude is suffering, Sasuke. Now I know exactly how that feels. I have both family and friends. But if you were
no longer here, Sasuke… for me it would be the same
as solitude. From here… we’re going to start walking down
our new paths individually. I…I love you so
very, very much, Sasuke! If you would only be
with me, Sasuke, I wouldn't let you regret it,
no matter what! I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke! So…I’m begging you,
please stay here! I’ll even help you
with your revenge! I’ll make it happen somehow,
I promise you! So stay here with me! If that doesn’t work for you,
then take me with you. You really are…annoying. Don't go! If you go, I'll scream and… Sakura… Thank you. I was sure…I was prepared. Sakura! Damn it! This always happens right after
I use the Mangekyo! Stop, Sasuke! Naruto?! Naruto… Sasuke, I’m going to save you from
the chaos of your vengeance.

 I don’t need that.

 The stage has already been set
for my vengeance to happen!

 What?

 Severing all bonds with the Leaf

 shall lead to
the Uchiha’s true restoration!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Two Fates"

 I guess we just have to do this then.

 Tune in again!

 How's this? So can your borrowed Sharingan
extinguish that?! I will show you the difference between the real thing
and a fake! Damn it! My sight! Sakura! Why are you here? Don't! I won't let Kakashi Sensei
bear the burden! I'm different from you guys. I'm walking a road that's
incompatible with the rest of you. The four of us worked together... and it's true that
there was a time when I thought that
was my road. The four of us have
worked together, but in the end,
I decided on revenge. That's been my reason
for living. I can't be like you or Naruto. I'll do anything for you, Sasuke! So...I'm begging you,
please stay here! I'll even help you
with your revenge! I'll make it happen somehow,
I promise you! So stay here with me! If that doesn't work for you,
then take me with you. You really are…annoying. Don't go! If you go, I'll scream and… Sakura… Thank you. Sakura! Stop, Sasuke! Two Fates

 Your timing is better
than mine, Naruto. I never imagined you coming here.
You're a lifesaver! Th-Thank you, Naruto. Sasuke really tried to kill me. If Naruto hadn't come,
I would be dead now. By Sasuke's own hand. Sasuke… Sakura is a fellow ninja
from Team 7. "Was" a fellow ninja.
I no longer belong. Now do you understand,
Naruto, Sakura? His intent to kill is real. Sasuke is no longer
the same person as before. Sasuke… What? I heard the truth about Itachi
from a guy named Tobi. The truth about Itachi? I don't know for sure
if what he said is really true or not. But it doesn't matter. What you've been doing is… understandable. Naruto… I told you before. You don't have parents or siblings,
so you couldn't possibly understand me. So outsiders can keep
their mouths shut! Do you know what Naruto
has gone through for you? No matter what rumors
we hear about you, he never stops thinking
of you as a friend. While everyone targeted you, Naruto alone tried to rescue you! Even now… Rescue me? From what? Well, from… From revenge. I swear I'll save you from
the chaos of vengeance. There's no need for that. The stage has already been set
for my vengeance to happen! Just awhile ago, I finally got to take revenge
on one of Itachi's enemies. How many Uchiha did
you kill to get that right arm?! It was Itachi who enabled me
to get it. You made him do it! This is the Reverse
Tetragram Sealing Jutsu. Sasuke!
Get away from Danzo! I killed a high-ranking elder
of the Hidden Leaf. Someone named Danzo. Sasuke killed Danzo all by himself? I've never felt like this before. I feel the tainted Uchiha name
becoming cleansed. I feel the Uchiha getting free
from this rotting ninja world. You guys couldn't begin
to understand. And isn't what I'm doing exactly
what you Leaf ninja wanted all along? You've always snubbed and
put down the Uchiha. So I'll help erase the Uchiha
from your memories. I'm going to kill all of you, and destroy the Hidden Leaf! Severing all bonds to
the Hidden Leaf is the ultimate purification! And that shall lead to
the Uchiha's true restoration! Sasuke… Hatred. The history of repeated
accumulating hatred. That is what created
the Sasuke in front of us. Though they may not realize it, Naruto and Sakura are
seeing with their own eyes that Sasuke is a victim
of the times we live in. And that is why… This is my task. Naruto, Sakura.
Get out of here. But Kakashi Sensei… If you stay, you'll see things
you do not want to see. Now go! I… Sakura, the poison-laced kunai
Shizune taught you how to use won't kill Sasuke. Orochimaru gave him
resistance to poisons. What's more… You've come to terms
with your feelings, right? Sasuke… I healed you. But your body cannot…
withstand another battle. Sasuke… Don't move, Karin. A vital point…
Right through the hostage! That's what I wanted to see. Brother… One down. No… I don't care about
Sasuke anymore. Kakashi Sensei,
this "something" I don't want to see… Are you going to kill Sasuke? Go! Both of you! Now's my chance!
I'm not holding back! Wait, Naruto! Naruto! There's a chance, Sasuke… that our roles… could have been reversed. Run…keep running…
and cling to life. Then one day, come before me with
the same eye that I possess. – Chidori!
– Rasengan! Sasuke… You remember, right? The entire village used
to despise me. It's because I have
the Nine-Tails inside me. At one time, I hated the village too. I even thought about revenge. I want you to wipe off
every bit of that graffiti! Look. It's that boy. Why is he allowed to remain
in the village? I wish the Third Hokage
would reconsider. Shut up! You brat! Go away! What's the big idea?! Here! I'll give that to you
if you just leave. Why? Why?! Why does everyone,
even my homeroom teacher… Why do you all look
at me like that?! I'm not a nuisance and
I'm not some kind of germ! I'm… I'm Naruto Uzumaki! One step in the wrong direction and I might have conjured up
some terrible plan just like you. I used to think I didn't have
any bonds with anyone. That's until I met you
and Iruka Sensei. Koji! Time to go home! Daichi! Dinnertime! Okay. Let's go home, everyone. Mom! What are you doing? I told you not to play with that boy. Come on, let's go! Naruto… I'll tell you the truth. You know about
the incident 12 years ago when the fox spirit
was sealed, right? Since then, there's been
a certain law in the village. A certain law? Well… It's a law that you were
never supposed to know about. Only me?
Why is there such a law? It's a law that forbids
anyone from saying that your true form
is the fox spirit. Namely, you are
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit that killed Iruka's parents
and destroyed the village. Ever since our beloved
Fourth Hokage sealed the Nine-Tails, the entire village has deceived you! No one will ever accept you! Die, Naruto! Naruto, get down! But… I understand, Naruto. You must have been
so lonely, huh? You must have suffered so much. Forgive me, Naruto. If I had been more reliable, you wouldn't have had
to endure this. I almost gave in to despair. But you and Iruka Sensei saved me. I knew that you were always alone. Watching you, I felt reassured
that I wasn't the only one. We were both kids,
and looking back… I had to live with the Nine-Tails
and you, the fate of the Uchiha. It's ironic that
we had similar burdens. To be honest,
every time I saw you, I wanted to walk over
and start talking. I'd get sort of giddy. Because I felt like you
understood me. But I stopped. The reason is because I was jealous because
you were good at everything. So I made you my rival. From then on,
you've been my goal. Hey Sasuke, do you remember

 what you said to me long ago
in the Final Valley?

 The thing about when
two shinobi are of a high enough level…

 I just learned a lot about you
by trading blows with you.

 Can you tell what I'm thinking?
Can you read my thoughts?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"High-Level Shinobi"

 Why are you so fixated on me?

 Tune in again!

 High-Level Shinobi

 That Danzo… He destroyed Shisui's eye
before he died. You've been… my goal. I had nothing,
but I built bonds with Team 7. With you and Sakura. I'll end it with this! What?! He's after Naruto?! I have to make it! You'll never stop…
being a burden. Sasuke, you… Why? Why did you protect me? Why are you looking at me
like that? You loser. Why…did you…? Mind your own business! Like… I care. I…used to hate you. Sasuke… You better not die. Sasuke… Sasuke! Hey! Are you hurt, Scaredy Cat? Over here! You're the one messing up
our teamwork! You're always showing off! Speak for yourself, loser! If you don't want to owe me, you should just become
stronger than me. Hey, are you hurt, Scaredy Cat? Here you go!
Thanks for waiting! Imagine that,
the three of you treating me. I wouldn't be surprised
if it snowed. – It totally worked!
– It totally worked! Chidori! Even if I have to beat you to
a pulp and drag you, I'll bring you back! I wanted to be strong
and cool like you. That's why I kept chasing
after you. I'm really glad I met you. Naruto… You can't change me,
no matter what you say to me now. I'm going to kill
each and every person in the Leaf, including you! And I'll get revenge for
the Uchiha Clan! Is that really the only way? Yes. So your only choices are
to kill me and become the hero who
saved the village, or to be killed by me and
become known as just a loser! Sasuke… I don't believe that. I'm not going to be the loser,
or the hero who killed you! Neither one's gonna happen! I… Whoa! You! When did you—? I've been tagging along
for quite a while. Tobi told me to make sure
you didn't notice me. But, since you were in a crisis… I should summon him soon. It doesn't seem like
he's going to retreat quietly. Naruto… I told you to go back
to the village. Now… it's all clear. I'd better collect the Rinnegan
before the war begins. Sasuke's in a bind.
What do you want to do? "It's all clear"? What do you mean, Naruto? What's going on, Sasuke? I told you to go home and rest. Madara… The Nine-Tails, huh? It seems you cannot suppress
the urge to fight when you two get together. I'll arrange a proper place
for you to hunt the Nine-Tails. For now, we retreat. I'll fight in your stead. Since we need the Nine-Tails
Jinchuriki anyway. Madara as well as Zetsu? They're sticking close to Sasuke. This is going to be tough
all by myself. What should I do? Zetsu… You can't capture Naruto. The Nine-Tails will be too much
for a non-combat type like you. I'm going to let Sasuke
get the Nine-Tails. It's for my enjoyment as well. Oh, is that so? But I'm concerned about Kisame. So go to him. And rendezvous with Black Zetsu. Okay, okay, I understand. Naruto! I'm all right. But I need to make sure
I say something to Sasuke. Let's go, Sasuke. Wait. Sasuke… Do you remember? Do you remember what you said
to me long ago in the Final Valley? The thing about high-level shinobi. When two shinobi are
of a high enough level, they can read each other's thoughts through no more than
a trade of blows. They don't need to say a word. You're naïve, Naruto. So tell me… Were you able to read what
was inside of my heart? Clashing face-to-face. Just now, we learned things from
just trading blows with each other. It means we've become
high-level shinobi. You and me. Sasuke… Were you able to read… what was inside
of my heart? And you saw it, didn't you? That if you and I fight… we will both die. Sasuke… If you attack the Hidden Leaf,
I will have to fight you. Save your hatred until then. At that time, throw all of
your hatred at me. The only one who can
handle all that hatred… is me. Only I can fulfill that duty! And on that day, I'll bear the burden of
your hate and die with you! What is it with you, Naruto? Just what the hell do you want?! Why are you so fixated on me?! Because you're my friend! Sasuke… I knew from the moment we first met
that it was going to take more than just ordinary means
to understand you. Exchanging fists is how
we understand each other. That's for sure. Like I said just now… It means we've become
high-level shinobi. Once we understand each other,
your hatred will go away. The same way that I changed
after meeting Iruka Sensei. I'm not giving up yet. I'm taking you back
to Hidden Leaf Village! That's something I'll never give up on! Naruto…you… Well, I've rambled on enough. Damn it. A poor talker like me lecturing you,
it's not my style. If we both end up dying… You won't be an Uchiha and
I won't be the Nine-Tail's Jinchuriki. We'll be free of all our burdens. And we'll finally be able to understand
each other in the next world! I don't plan on changing. Nor am I interested
in understanding you. And I don't plan on dying! You're the one who's going to die. If I die, we both die, Sasuke. Fine then! I'll kill you first. It's clear you still haven't
acknowledged me yet. Enough, Naruto.
I'll take Sasuke on. You have your precious dream
of becoming the Hokage. I can't let Sasuke take
you down with him. How can I become the Hokage if I can't even save one friend?! I'll fight Sasuke! Naruto stands here
with clear resolve. I'll bear the burden of
your hate and die with you! Compared to him,
my resolve is weak. I'm a shinobi. Yet all I do is cry and
keep relying on Naruto. I came here thinking
I was past all that. But I haven't prepared myself
for anything. I can't do a thing. I can't say anything. All I can do… is trust them! All right, Naruto.
I'll leave Sasuke to you. However, Sakura… Watch over my body. I'll get rid of Madara
once and for all. Kamui! Forget it, Kakashi. A jutsu like that won't work on me. Let's go, Sasuke. Madara, I'll talk to you later. I'll be ready anytime, Sasuke. What did you want
to talk to me about? I want Itachi's eyes. So you finally made up your mind. You've overused the Susano'o. I'm aware that you can barely see. It's perfect timing. Transplant them right away. You're in a hurry.
What's going on? I'm going use every ounce of
my strength to crush Naruto! I'll eradicate him completely! That's all. Naruto… Thank you, as always! Because of you,
I can still hope for the day that we'll laugh together again
as Team 7. – What?!
– Wha—?! Naruto! A scratch on his cheek.
This must be the cause. Then it's… Naruto?! Naruto… It's from the poison-dipped
kunai knife I used earlier. Seems like it. You need to administer
the antidote right away, Sakura! I'm taking you to Hidden Leaf Village. So please behave yourself. I wouldn't try anything at this point. I still feel sick. A-Are you all right? You're gonna throw up! – So that's…
– Hold on a minute! Naruto Uzumaki, huh? Are you ready? Do it. Brother… I will crush
the Hidden Leaf! Yo! Long time no see Omoi! Karui!

 Have ya been getting along cheerfully,
care-free-ly? Merrily?

 Of course not!

 After you suddenly disappeared
from the village like that…

 Now, now! He was safe all this time
so it's all okay!

 What's that?

 Just a spoil of war from my battle

 against one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen.

 It's taken a liking to me.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Infiltrator"

 Wow, so this is one of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen's blades, huh?

 Tune in again!

 By the way, Kakashi Sensei,
who's that on your back? She's one of Sasuke's comrades. Not anymore. I have a lot of questions
I want to ask her, so I'm taking her
back to the village. I see. So we're going back
to Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto, not that way. What're you saying,
Kakashi Sensei? Hidden Leaf Village is this way. We forgot something in
the Land of Iron. Right, Sakura? Forgot something… Oh! We should go back
and retrieve it, right? Yes. Hmm? What is it? I feel awful! What are you doing here? You were supposed to go back
to the village with me. You even made a hole
in the floor of the inn! Naruto… Let's get going soon. Naruto… Damn it! Why? That was a clone just now! I-I'm so sorry! I had to pursue you, and I was barely
able to apologize to the innkeepers! Naruto came in the nick of time,
but it seems you didn't send him over. Of course not! After all, you told me
to take Naruto back to the village. In essence,
Naruto left you behind. No, well… It turned out fine, Yamato. If Naruto hadn't come,
Sakura might have been dead now. And maybe even me,
depending on the circumstances. Sasuke's chakra was
different from the past. It was dark and cold. Still… Sasuke is Sasuke. You're right. Sasuke is Sasuke. Yeah. Anyway, that's what happened,
Yamato. So please forgive Naruto. I understand. Release! Ok. Please go on ahead. What about you? I'm going back to the inn to
repair the hole Naruto made. Sorry, Captain Yamato. Honestly… Let's get going too. Sasuke abandoned me. And now, I'm the Hidden Leaf's
prisoner of war. I wonder how Suigetsu
and Jugo are doing. Whatever…
Like I care anymore. THE INFILTRATOR

 Danzo should have
returned some time ago. How do you intend to explain the unfortunate outcome
of the Five Kage Summit? May I enter? What is it, Shikaku? There's been an unusual disturbance
among the members of the Foundation. Disturbance?
Within the Foundation? They seem restless.
But I don't know the reason. Lord Homura, Lady Koharu… Speak of the devil. Has there been any word
from Lord Danzo? No. We are waiting for him
to return too. They are restless indeed. The higher-ups don't
know anything either. Then Sai! He headed for
the Land of Iron too. Find Sai. Have him report
everything that's happened. We're home! – Lord Bee!
– Lord Bee! Yo! Long time no see,
Omoi, Karui! Have ya been getting by cheerfully,
care-free-ly? Merrily? Of course not! Not after you suddenly disappeared
from the village like that. Do you know
how worried we were?! Now, now! He was safe all this time,
so it's all okay now! Lord Raikage, welcome home. I know it's sudden, but we wish
to hold a council right away regarding what transpired at
the Five Kage Summit Conference. What? No down time? We can't afford to take it easy. Things are about to
get even hotter. Why is that? The Fourth Great Ninja War. Huh? An Allied Shinobi Force
has been formed. Tell them the details
at the meeting. Also, we'll need to meet
with the Feudal Lord. I have requested
an audience with him. Huh? What's that? Just a spoil of war from my battle against
one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men. It's taken a liking to me.
It won't leave my side. Wow, so this is one of the Seven Ninja
Swords Men's blades, huh? Unbelievable!
As expected of you Lord Bee! As expected, eh? Even "as expected" me
is at someone's mercy. Well? Did you record the battle? Yeah. What about Samehada? The Eight-Tails took it. I see. Then… Yeah. It went perfectly. You've got to hand it to Kisame. I will declare the start of the Fourth Great Ninja War
at the Five Kage Summit. So the time is now ripe. Once I've declared war, I suspect the Eight-Tails' freedom
will be restricted and he'll be confined. Then you can hunt him
at your own leisure. I'm ready anytime, but… First, we infiltrate. We sneak into their midst
and obtain intel. So this is an infiltration mission? Use White Zetsu. Once he makes contact, he can copy
a person's chakra and create a clone. Leave it to me. However, he's weak. You can't use him in battle,
but he's good for deception. If fighting the Eight-Tails
gets too exciting, I might end up almost killing him,
but I accept! All right. I'll leave the Eight-Tails
in your hands. Leave it to me. I searched high and low for you,
Eight-Tails. My great blade Samehada
loves powerful chakra. And it seems to have finally caught
scent of some delicious chakra. I'm sorry, but you're going to
be food for my Samehada. Not to worry though,
I won't kill you. Now then, this is where things
start getting tough. It was good to let Samehada take
a liking to the Eight-Tails. I never imagined it would even
share chakra with him. Though that ended up
working in my favor. Their Sensory-Type Ninja
hasn't caught on yet. It's not surprising. Since Samehada takes in
Kisame's chakra and uses it for energy, they have the same
chakra signature. The enemy doesn't
know any better. I could take on
the infiltration mission. You are weak. Ultimately, we are going to
capture the Eight-Tails. Kisame is the suitable one. But you pulled off
that performance quite well. It wasn't easy switching places
with Kisame underwater. I'm not used to it. Don't you think you're overdoing it? It was just right for the Eight-Tails. I guess it's my turn now. I leave it in your hands. Water Style:
Super Shark Bomb— – Double Lariat!
– Double Lariat! I can undo my Body Substitution
Jutsu now, right? Yeah. It's almost feeding time.
Let's merge. Is this is what you forgot? How could these guys
just lay around sleeping while you were in
such a bind, Sakura? Sakura! They were going to help you. Apologize properly after
you wake them up. I will. You're going to wake them up? Damn it. Naruto… It's my fault that they're asleep. So be gentle
when you wake them. I feel sick. You're going to sleep too? Naruto's like that because of you…
umm, Sakura, right? It's because of your poison. What a carefree guy.
He's already asleep. He's sleeping so soundly. I think a burden's been
lifted off of him. However, we don't
have time to waste. Sakura, wake them up. H-Huh? Sakura? Next up, Sai. I'm up. The drug has worn off. I'm sorry. Huh? How come Naruto's here?! And he's fast asleep too! I'll explain on the way home. Hey, get up! Oh Kiba… Gently!
Gently please! But…why? Do you still feel nauseous? No. But can you take a look? Looks fine to me. Then the Curse Mark is gone? Lord Danzo had placed
a Curse Mark on my tongue. Danzo is the new Hokage, right? Although he hasn't
officially taken office yet. What about him? The fact that the Curse Mark
is gone means… It seems like it. I can't believe it. Lord Danzo? This girl knows more about it. This Danzo you're talking about… Sasuke got him. Sasuke?! Do you mean that
Sasuke killed him? Why?! He was the Hokage! That's all I have to say. Tell us in detail! What's going on?!
I don't get it at all! Make it an extra large. – You get up too and explain!
– Now, now, Kiba. Wake up, Naruto! All right! Next up is the meeting
with the Feudal Lord! He is already waiting for you. All right!
Don't waste any time, everyone! Especially you, Bee! What is it, Brother? You understand, don't you? Sure I do!
I really do understand. Yay. Things have gotten really bad. I know.
A Great Ninja War they say. In other words,
just an all-out war. So newbies like us,
who have no experience in a real war, are gonna be sent to the frontlines. And we'll be surrounded by
this Akatsuki troop that no one knows much about…
and it'll mean certain death for us. But we have no choice but to
give it our all, so I'll fight hard. But the enemy's counterattack will be
relentless and I'll end up crying. And Karui, if you die… So you're killing me off,
you jerk?! Yo, don't despair young ones.
Yay! Lord Bee… I'll put your troubled hearts
at ease, baby. With my sentimental rap. Sentimental? Damn it, this is ridiculous! We listened to her wishes and
even located Sasuke for her. Now don't be so upset, Kiba. Don't act like you're
the only hero here, Sakura. You told us to keep this
a secret from Naruto, but Sai went and blabbed it all to him,
on top of which, Sasuke got away. Kiba! Be a man and quit complaining. Speak for yourself, Naruto! Huh? Me? Oh, you're right about that! You are too simple and dumb to be able to think as complexly
as you've been attempting. Hey Sai! Since when did you develop
such a carefree laugh? Huh? Thank you. That wasn't a compliment! What is it, Bushy Brow? It's like you're back
to your old self, Naruto. He means you
haven't grown at all. Once an idiot, always an idiot. Kiba, you're the idiot!
Idiot! I don't wanna hear that
coming from an idiot! I've had enough of
your smiling face! This guy is the complete
opposite of Sasuke. His chakra is…so…
bright and warm. What is this? Deep inside him…
A chakra like this? So dark! As though… Sai, you need to explain
everything that's happened. Who are these guys? Members of the Foundation,
from the Anbu Black Ops. It seems you are aware of it too. The reason why the Curse Mark
placed on us by Lord Danzo is gone. Is Lord Danzo…dead? Yes. That's… What about his bodyguards,
Foo and Torune? I'm in the dark about them too. They were not at the site. Therefore, I would like to
propose a discussion about the future of
the Foundation with you. And with the new Hokage here… New Hokage? Kakashi Hatake. Huh?! We'll head back ahead of you. You're going to be the next Hokage,
Kakashi Sensei? Looks like it's going to be that way. I'll get right to the point. The Five Great Nations of
the Hidden Cloud, Hidden Leaf, Hidden Stone, Hidden Mist,
and the Hidden Sand along with samurai of the Land of Iron
have formed the Allied Shinobi Forces. Therefore, I ask for your approval. Why such haste, Raikage? Rivalries exist among the shinobi. And now, you are pooling your strength
to form a military alliance? For what reason? The Tailed Beasts. Tailed Beasts? A group known as the Akatsuki
has taken possession of seven of the Tailed Beasts
and has declared war on us. The Fourth Great Ninja War. Continue. The remaining Tailed Beasts are the Hidden Leaf's Nine-Tails
and our own Eight-Tails. We have no choice but to cooperate. This is not a case of the retainer wanting
to replace his lord, is it, Raikage? We don't even know if we will
be able to protect the Feudal Lords. That's how difficult this battle will be. I understand, Raikage. I approve your alliance. Then I request that you convene
a Feudal Lord Summit. A Feudal Lord Summit? Do you know how difficult
that is to arrange? Please arrange it. I guess I have no choice. I will do as you say. Thank you! We have approval from
the Feudal Lord. Now we can officially
prepare for war. Yes. I will begin all phases
of preparations. I hope the other villages will
start preparing right away. I don't know about
the Hidden Leaf. Looks like they have
Hokage succession issues. The Sand too. Their Kazekage is young
and knows nothing of war. Never mind the others. Make haste and prepare
for an all-out battle! What is that? I'm not sure. Yay! – Yay!
– Yay! Yo young ones! Blast your worries away,
knock 'em out of sight. My rap song is filled
with passion, baby. – Yay!
– Yay! Now listen to me. Master Kin polished my style
and added more passion. It's a new enka rap! It's called "Gosaku"! So thank you! – Yay!
– Yay! Yay! Drop Kick! You haven't learned a thing,
have you? Big Bro, your kick is really effective.
Not again! It's certain that
the Akatsuki is strong.

 But the true strength of
our Allied Shinobi Forces,

 which is unparalleled in history,
is an unknown.

 If we unite all
the shinobi's power

 I believe we can
counter them thoroughly.

 Above all, we must win this battle
or the world will end.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Five Great Nations Mobilize."

 From this point forward,
begin the preparations for the Great War!

 Tune in again!

 Oh, my body’s still hurts. You can’t sleep on the ground
without the right gear. Sorry! I’m sorry! But I guess it’s okay. It looks like we can get back to
the village before the day’s over. What about Kakashi Sensei? Yes, about that… I’m counting on you. Kakashi Sensei, what was that? Messages to every Hidden Village. We are working toward
a united front. We have to share critical intel
as early as possible. The Akatsuki possess
the Tailed Beasts. We cannot go on and do nothing. Besides, they are led by
that Madara Uchiha. We must do everything we can now. I know that. Then hurry up and
give your approval. Are you willing to lose this war? But the Allied Shinobi Force… What if we give them
too much power and this decision comes back
to haunt us later? Do you really distrust
your own nation’s shinobi that much? First of all… We will need you to come
to a decision soon. The battery is running low.
It is such a long distance. Let’s conclude this. Lightning approves this. Earth agrees with Lightning. Wind approves this as well. Why not? Fire approves it. All right.
Water approves it as well. So now, with this… The formation of
the Allied Shinobi Force is ratified. Monitors on record.
I, Tenga, shall serve as the witness. Thank you all very much.
This ends the transmission. It is finally over. Now it would be good to contact
the Hidden Leaf at once. The Five Great Nations Mobilize

 Sakura… I wonder where she is now. Was she able to persuade Naruto? Kiba and Lee are with her.
I’m sure everything’s okay. Still… Well, worrying about it here
won’t do any good. Did something happen? Hey, Shikamaru. Can I talk to you? Dad? TOBIMARU


Lord Kazekage has returned. Did you receive
Tobimaru’s message? Yes, ma’am! Any word from the Feudal Lords? Yes, just a while ago. It said that they all
gave their approval. It came sooner than expected. Well, considering the situation… Those lords, who often act slowly, had no choice but to act quickly. Things are gonna get busy. We’ll meet immediately. Send for all the officials at once. Welcome home, Lady Mizukage. We received word from
the Feudal Lord. Let’s hear it, go ahead! Sir. The Feudal Lords of
the Five Great Nations have approved
the Allied Shinobi Forces. Is that so? It’s finally time. We must hurry to get
ourselves ready too. But it’s a good thing we were
able to secure the Eight-Tails before it fell into
our enemy’s hands. It’s said that the Akatsuki member
Kisame Hoshigaki was defeated in that fight. We were able to weaken the enemy’s
might before the war began, so that was great. Just what you’d expect
from Lord Raikage. Kisame Hoshigaki… Really? That guy who was
called the Tailless Tailed Beast. What’s the matter, Chojuro? No… Umm… Nothing… Where’s your energy?
Are you hungry, or something? I’ve got it! I’ll treat you to
a meal after this! Huh? Of course, it’ll be fried pork cutlets! For good luck in battle! FRIED PORK CUTLETS


Fried pork cutlets… HUSBAND HUNTING


Husband hunting?! I-I don’t care for…oily foods. How pitiful! Keep that up and you’ll fail
at the crucial moment. HUSBAND HUNTING



 FAIL

HUSBAND HUNTING?!


Husband hunting…
You’ll…fail?! At times like these, you should accept whatever
your elder tells you. Shut up, or I’ll kill you. Well, that was quick. Those lords worked quickly because the Tailed Beasts
and Madara were mentioned. I can understand the Tailed Beasts. But isn’t Madara someone
from long ago? He must be really old by now. He didn’t look that old. So who looks older,
him or our old man? I tell you.
The ignorant have it so easy. Well, something like war…
It just doesn’t seem real. Heaven help us… if all our shinobi are young kids
who know nothing of war. Of course, you-know-who got
talked down by one of those kids. When did you all forsake yourselves? Well, let’s just see what
the young ones have got! According to the reports, it seems there was quite
an uproar at the conference. It was unusual that the Sixth Hokage
tried to turn things in his favor. The venue was kept secret
and security was tight. Who would have thought that place
would be breeched so easily? But that’s the Akatsuki for you. They got into the place so easily
and threw us into an uproar. Tell us everything. It was right after
the conference started. They suddenly appeared out
of the least expected place. Hello! One problem after another!
Now what?! Is it the Akatsuki?! It seems so. Sasuke Uchiha has snuck in! Now, where could he be hiding? I’m very irritated right now. If you attack,
I’ll show no mercy. I would say the same to you! Elbow Bolt! Gale Style: Laser Circus! Sasuke! W-What is this?! Gaara… This is even greater
than your Ultimate Defense. Impossible! An absolute defense greater
than that of the Kazekage? That’s what he said. It must have been a Visual Jutsu
of the Mangekyo Sharingan. And then… They made us withdraw and they headed for
the conference room. He’s coming. Above? It pains my heart every time I see such
a handsome man melt away. But you have to die. So a brat like you
defeated Deidara? Well, I hold no grudge against you,
but many ninja wish you dead. So long… Particle Style:
Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! My name is Madara Uchiha. Sasuke! I have something I want
to explain to you all. And once you comprehend it,
I want to pose a question. To think that four Kage together
couldn’t take on Sasuke Uchiha. That is the power of the Akatsuki. Why did they attack
the Five Kage Summit? To show off their strength? Judging from their individual actions, it is difficult to say whether
the objectives of Sasuke Uchiha and Madara
were the same. However, it seems that
Madara thought, with any luck, he could take
the five Kage hostage in order to advance his own plan. The five Kage?! How arrogant! What was Madara’s plan? He called it his
"Project Tsuki no Me." He already has possession
of seven Tailed Beasts, beginning with my One-Tail. It seems Madara plans to collect the two remaining Tailed Beasts
and resurrect the Ten-Tails, the combination of every Tailed Beast, in order to make himself
the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails. And using that power, he would place the world
under Infinite Tsukuyomi. And he would place
all humans under his rule, and he would control them. A world free of antagonism and strife.
Is that what he said? Ridiculous! That would be
the end of the world. Exactly. That’s all the more reason
we must stop him. That is what the Allied
Shinobi Forces are for. But if that is the case, I worry about the whereabouts
of Danzo Shimura. I hear that he was
the one controlling the Hidden Leaf from behind the scenes
for a long time. I’d hate to get shot in
the back at a time when we are all trying
to build solidarity. As to that, every Hidden Village should
now be out searching for him. It seems some of
the Mizukage’s followers did come in contact
with him once, but… What? We’re in the middle
of a meeting. Pardon me.
There is an urgent report. Come in. We have received a message from Kakashi Hatake
of the Hidden Leaf. It seems Kakashi Hatake
and two other ninja came upon Sasuke Uchiha
and Madara, and fighting ensued. It seems they were able to
confirm the death of Danzo Shimura. Danzo is dead?! What?! Someone so skilled that
he became the Hokage? What about Madara and Sasuke? Sir! It seems they used
the Transportation Technique to disappear. It’s certain, the Akatsuki
is definitely strong. Their capability of war waging
is unknown. But the true strength of
our Allied Shinobi Forces, which is unparalleled in history,
is also unknown. Earth, Water, Fire, Wind,
and Lightning… If we unite all the shinobi’s power, I believe we can
counter them thoroughly. Above all, we must win this battle
or the world will end. Begin stockpiling ninja tools
and rations immediately. All official missions will
be temporarily halted in preparation for battle. Give me a list of all shinobi
belonging to the village. At the same time, I want each platoon to begin
preparing their tactical plans. No way! Sasuke attacked
the Five Kage Summit?! I hear they’re about to announce it. Seems there is utter confusion
among the officials. So it’s true that Sasuke is
a member of the Akatsuki, who crushed the Hidden Leaf. Looks like this is gonna
turn out to be a drag. These are orders
from Lady Mizukage. Confirm our supplies of
ninja tools immediately! Make a list of anything
we’re short on! I don’t know about
this Allied Shinobi Forces, but I won’t join up with
those guys from the Stone. The Akatsuki is a hateful group
that brought the nightmare of
the Fourth Mizukage upon this nation. The Hidden Stone have used the Akatsuki again and again,
until now. The higher-ups may order it, but there’s no way Ganryu
would accept it. You’re being very careful with them. They are the great masterpieces
of a legendary puppeteer. I cannot allow myself
to be bested by the generations of
puppeteers before me. What about you? I just sent off messages to those ninja currently
on far away missions. But to think it has come to
killing a Hokage. You mean Sasuke Uchiha? I knew it, but he’s really fallen
as low as you can get. But… Naruto, you told me,
"I am going to be the Hokage." I became the Kazekage. If you are prepared to bear
the burden of being a Kage, then do what is right
as Sasuke's friend. He didn’t seem to
be convinced, did he? It’s because he never gives up. He’s the one who changed
the old Gaara, the one we could never approach. No matter how lost in
the darkness a person might be, he will hold out his hand. He will try to save him. That’s how he is. Gaara… But it’s Sasuke himself
who’s seeking the darkness. This time, I don’t think… It has to be Naruto’s decision
after that. What he will do as a friend. I will simply give my all to
protect my friends… and the world! Look. There’s another black Kite flying in. How many does that make? Come on, Konohamaru,
forget about that! I’d rather know where
Naruto has gone! It’s a Leaf Hero Newspaper,
after all. I haven’t snagged
the all-important interview! Yeah. When he and I had
that Pervy Ninjutsu contest, he said he would come right back. Wha—?! What do you mean
by Pervy Ninjutsu?! You’re so lewd, Konohamaru! Lewd?! You’re talking about
my secret lethal move! Konohamaru! They say Naruto
has come home! Sakura… I’m back. I heard from my dad…
about Sasuke. Yeah… And I fought with him. "Fought"? You mean with Sasuke?! I’ll give you the details later. Sorry, but would you mind getting
everybody together? There’s something I want to say. Okay. Naruto. We were waiting for you,
you know? Hey, you guys. I just need to get an interview
from you and the Leaf Hero Newspaper
will be done! Naruto, time for your interview! Oh, that’s right. But I have to make a report,
so let’s do it another time. What? You keep saying next time! But you promised! You always keep us waiting!
You're so mean, Naruto! So when’s "next time"? – Yeah, we’ve been waiting for so long!
– Naruto! Come on, when? – C’mon!
– Naruto! Hey! Why don’t you say
something too, Konohamaru? I wonder what happened. Huh? There seems to be something
different about Naruto. Huh? What are you
talking about, Konohamaru? There’s nothing different.
He looks like his usual self. That’s true, but… So when is "next time"? What’s that? They’re fast!

 It’s Kakashi Sensei and Guy Sensei.

 Those two…
Could it be that again?

 No mistake about it.
It’s their rivalry contest.

 Guy Sensei probably
challenged him.

 Of all the times to do this.

 No, that’s exactly why
he’s doing this now.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage"

 What a splendid contest, Guy Sensei!

 Tune in again!

 Boss! No, no! Stop! Huh? What's wrong?
I was just about to start! This is terrible! It seems Lord Danzo has died! He's not the Sixth Hokage anymore! Not anymore! What are you saying? I've prepared and I've studied
Lord Danzo's face so well I even see him in my dreams! Damn… What the heck?! So… Who's going to be
the next Hokage? INTEL DIVISION She originally worked
for Orochimaru before she joined up with Sasuke
as a shinobi for the Akatsuki. That means she knows a lot. You better treat me well. And… It looks like she was there when
Sasuke and Danzo battled it out. You saw them fighting? You're interrogating me here? Okay, we'll hold her at
the Intel Division. We'll get everything she knows. Take her away. Yes, sir. Hey…no! I won't try to escape. So let go of me, will you?! Jeez! I'm so thirsty,
give me something to drink! By the way,
how's Lady Tsunade doing? She's still unconscious. I see. Well, I'll go make my report
to the superiors. Excuse me. Kakashi… The chain of command in
the Hidden Leaf Village is in shambles. Someone has to restore order
as soon as possible. Yeah… I know that. Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage

 Sasuke did that? It's an unbelievable situation. That's why I want you to
let me handle Sasuke. You'll take on Sasuke alone?! How can you expect us
to agree to that? Tenten is right, Naruto. We can't just give in to
your stubbornness. The reason is because
this is a big problem for the village. I'm not being stubborn. You said you'd give us
the details when we got home, but I never thought
this is what you'd say! We've all made up our minds
to kill Sasuke! Hey Naruto, don't tell me
you're saying you'll get Sasuke all by yourself, when you're actually planning
to protect him. No, I have no intention
of protecting Sasuke. – Chidori!
– Rasengan! After all that fighting at
the Five Kage Summit, and fighting Danzo… If Sasuke was weakened
at that time, why didn't you take
him out right then? Madara was there too! It didn't seem so easy. Besides… That's no reason to let him
get away so easily! Hey Naruto… You're strong. You're the hero who
took down Pain, aren't you?! Hero? Yeah. You could take Sasuke down
like you did back then. That's not true. Huh? I wouldn't be able to beat Sasuke
with something like that now. That's what I found out. Inside him… What is it that you found out? In any case, nobody should take
on Sasuke as he is now. What do you mean? I'm the only one who can fight him. That's what I mean. That doesn't tell us anything! Explain it in detail.
What happened? I said I'd tell you when
the time comes. Hey! There you go again!
Giving us the runaround! Damn it. Naruto… Sasuke… Were you able to read… what was inside of my heart? And you saw it, didn't you? That if you and I fight… we will both die. What are you hiding? Well… Please leave it to me. Hey! Naruto! Naruto… Hey, Naruto! Danzo too? Such a shame.
The best ones go first. We must quickly hold a meeting to determine who will
be the next Hokage. The Allied Shinobi Force
will be stalled if the Hokage is missing. That cannot be helped. We will recommend you for Hokage. The Sand,
a member of the alliance, has also recommended you. I am prepared for it. Oh… That was easy. Of course, it would be a little
out of character for me to be the Hokage. That's fine. I will go to the Feudal Lords
to request a conference. Go back to the village and
prepare until you are called. There really isn't anything
for me to prepare. Listen, Kakashi. Let me just say one thing
to the next Hokage. It is true that Danzo
was very ambitious, but everything he did was
for the sake of the village. Hiruzen out front and
Danzo in the back. Things went most smoothly
in Hidden Leaf back then. Is that meant to be
some sort of excuse? Just some advice. Don't try to take on everything
by yourself. It would be best to have
a confidant beside you. We are the only ones remaining
from the old days. There is no telling what
the fate of the shinobi will be. Sensei… They say I am going
to be the next Hokage. Yo! Kakashi! Looks like you got home safely. How are you? You weren't injured, were you? Oh, I'm fine. Okay, in that case… It's been a while,
so why don't we have a match? Why? Why?! Why? What do you mean? Because you and I
are eternal rivals, that's why! We've had over
100 matches up till now. Let's add another one! In that case… No using the Sharingan now. – Rock, paper, scissors!
– Rock, paper, scissors! No! Not that! I don't want
Rock Paper Scissors! Our challenge will be…that! I've set up a goal up there. We'll race to there. This is not the time for… That's exactly why
I want to have a hot challenge. You'll accept it, won't you,
my eternal rival?! You're right.
No time like the present I guess. All right! Let's do it! What? You want to start way out
at the entrance to the village? I want to enjoy this challenge
to the fullest. Are you ready? Anytime… – Start!
– Start! Ouch… When did you get those things?! Oh, before we started.
From a pile of rubble. That's not fair. Take that! What? Take that! Ouch! Are you thinking about Naruto? Yeah… Forget it. I don't think
it'll do any good. Won't do any good? If Naruto doesn't talk,
we won't find out anything. Here. I guess. What was that? Has something happened? With the village being reconstructed, the roads are all different and
I can't tell where we're going! Seems like it! What is that? Listen, I don't think
anyone will be satisfied with the way things stand. What are you talking about? About Sasuke… Are you satisfied, Sakura? I think you have
some sort of plan, so… I'm putting my faith in you! Is that Kakashi Sensei
and Guy Sensei?! So fast! Those two… Don't tell me
they're at it again?! No mistake about it.
It's their rivalry contest. Guy Sensei probably challenged him. Of all the times to do this. No, that's exactly why
he challenged him now. Huh?! Why? As expected from my rival! The challenge has just begun! Yeah! While Guy Sensei is battling it out,
I will fight too! Lee, who won? Kakashi Sensei is… the winner! That was a pretty good challenge. Congratulations! Oh no… This is nothing
to be congratulated for. Congratulations on becoming
the next Hokage! When you become the Hokage, you probably won't be able to
accept my challenges so easily. That's why I wanted to
challenge you for the last time before it happened. Thank you, Kakashi. This isn't the last time. We'll still be eternal rivals.
That won't change. Huh?! Guy, seriously,
I find it reassuring having you there. I hope I can count on
your continued support. Ka-Kakashi… I can't bring this whole village – together by myself.
– You're making me cry. – Hey are you listening? Hey! Hey!
– I'm listening. You're Kakashi Hatake, aren't you?
The next Hokage? Yes, well… Oh, this is perfect!
Let me measure your face! I want to get a mold too. W-What is this? It's for the Great Stone Faces.
The Stone Faces of the Hokage! I need you to come with me. J-Just a minute. It seems it's not easy
being the Hokage. I guess I've been one-upped
by my eternal rival. However… Yes! Now it is your turn to pass him. If Kakashi is to become the Hokage,
I will aim beyond that! I will go beyond Hokage,
far and beyond! Good luck, Sensei! Thanks! By the way,
what is beyond the Hokage? I wonder what it is. This hairstyle is okay, right? Umm… The headband should be
at an angle. You don't have to be exact. You must be joking. Once it's carved,
it can't be changed easily. I see. That's it! We haven't
missed anything, have we? No, sir! Then let's get ready to
make the mold. Got it! Is that plaster? That's right. We'll paint this on you
in thin layers to make a mold of your face! I want to start right away,
but you'll have to take that off. What?! That mask. Your Stone Face won't look good
if you're hiding your face. Somebody! Somebody,
come quickly! Please! What's happened? Shizune… Don't tell me… Thanks for accepting. I would feel a lot better if you would become
the Hokage, Shikaku. Don't be ridiculous. I'm old enough to retire and
have my son take over. Of course,
I'm in no position to do that. Yes. To think that Danzo fell
to the Akatsuki. Yes. We must decide on another Hokage. We are all recommending
Kakashi Hatake. Oh, that man? Kakashi Hatake, enter. Oh… Seems like a good choice. All right. Now then, Kakashi Hatake,
I appoint you… I appoint you… My lord, what is wrong? Oh, well… What number Hokage
do I appoint him? What number? Danzo was appointed Number Six, but he died before
he formally assumed the office. I don't know if Kakashi should
be Number Six or Number Seven. Even if Danzo had not
formally assumed the office… A missing number? He should be Number Six. No, I think Number Seven. But Number Six never really… All right. Kakashi Hatake!
You will be… Please excuse me! Guy? What is this?!
We are in an important conference. I have come to report a sudden change
in the state of affairs! What? A sudden change?! Lady Tsunade! Shizune…you're hurting me. Send messages to
the other villages! Tsunade, the Hokage
of Hidden Leaf Village, is alive and well! Report this to the Feudal Lords
of the other lands as well. We should let the people of
our village know at once. I will leave that to you. Umm… Well… May I go home? Since we're here now, why don't we go and eat at
that sushi boat restaurant? Let's see who can eat the most! Boss! It's no good! Stop! What happened? They say Lady Tsunade has
been reinstated as the Hokage. You gotta be kidding me!
I wasted my time again! It was indeed I who summoned you.

 Who're you again?

 C'mon, could you remember
my name already?

 That's right!

 That's right! I have seen
a prophecy involving you.

 Listen carefully.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder"

 It's all clear to me now.

 Tune in again!

with those now, huh? Those are puppets I made.
I already know its tricks. This is stupid... I wonder about that... <i>A wire?</i> Sakura! Stand back! Okay! Amazing... This is getting messy. I better hurry up and
use this thing... As I thought, that puppet... uses the Third Kazekage's Jutsu! You haven't seen this in a while,
have you...? This Jutsu is why the Third Kazekage
was praised as the most powerful. I'm gonna turn you guys into mush. What the heck is that? That was the most feared weapon
of the Village Hidden in the Sand. The Iron Sand. Once upon a time, there was a village in
where a boy lived. He was as cute as a button
and had flaming red hair... Who took millet dumplings along
as he set out to kill the ogres, right! What are you talking about? The story goes:
"He headed out shouldering a broad axe." Oh, yeah, that's right. Wrong, wrong.
He lived happily with his parents. And, rescued a turtle or something? Not even close. Huh, I quit, I quit. I don't even know what story
I was talking about anymore. - Huh? What happens next?
- Huh? What happens next? Next time:
"Father and Mother" Before he died,
Jiraiya said to me, "go store yourself inside Naruto." Are you crazy?! The key that corresponds to
Naruto's Eight-Signed Seal is transcribed on my belly! Each year,
the Fourth Hokage's seal weakens! The key remains in order
to re-seal it when it becomes necessary! To place such a key right next
to the safe is unheard of! Still, Minato entrusted it to us. It was always meant to be
returned to Naruto. It's too soon! Once you talked me into loosening
the Tetragram Seal… You haven't forgotten
what the results were, have you?! Yeah… However, the fact that Minato left me
the jutsu for the key convinces me that
he intended for Naruto to perfect that jutsu one day. Great Lord Elder! Are you sure this is the right thing? Jiraiya claimed that Naruto
could completely control the power of the Nine-Tails, but when we tested him,
it didn't go well. But Jiraiya refused to give in, saying that it was for that purpose
that Minato had sealed half of the Nine-Tails' chakra
inside of Naruto. Great Lord Elder, Gerotora himself
is the key to Naruto's Tetragram Seal. Is it safe to hand him over to Naruto? What do you think? Have Naruto Uzumaki come here. I shall do a reading on him. We will then see what
we must do. Huh? Is that true? It hasn't been officially
announced yet, but it's clear, judging from the activity in front of
the hut where she was resting. It seems that all of her attendants,
who were all in such low spirits, have been gathering
there smiling! I guess their prayers
have all been heard. Please eat more slowly! This is not enough! My chakra hasn't returned
to normal! Bring me more food! If I'm not careful,
I'll become an old hag! Uh-oh, no, no! The Hokage Quarters' supply stores
have run out. I'll go and requisition
more provisions, so please take a short break. No! Don't do it!
What are you thinking?! This one is completely off limits! What are you talking about? Huh? K-Kakashi… I'm glad to see you so well. This is nothing,
I'm just getting started. After all you've eaten,
it doesn't make any sense. I am relieved. I was dangerously close
to becoming the Hokage. But well, I'm not really
the Hokage type. Considering the present situation,
we need someone like you, Lady Tsunade, with wide influence,
to be the Hokage. I must say I am amazed to hear
about the Allied Shinobi Force. And I'm surprised that the Tsuchikage and the Raikage
agreed to cooperate. That just goes to prove what an awful situation
we are faced with. Madara Uchiha… He's really still alive? We don't have absolute proof, but considering what
they are trying to do, I'd say there's no doubt about it. Another war, huh? Who would have thought
the karma of the Uchiha would engulf all the shinobi
in the world. I will call a meeting immediately
after this meal! We must prepare for war! Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder

 You must rest for a while. It takes some time to become
accustomed to the Mangekyo. Are you in pain? No. It feels right. I can feel
Itachi's visual powers. I can feel myself getting stronger! INTEL DIVISION

And then, Orochimaru forced me
into hard labor. And then, Orochimaru forced me
into hard labor. And when Sasuke took over he kept giving poor old me
the most unreasonable demands. In the end, he treated me like dirt. I'm a victim too! I see. It must have been
hard on you! Jeez… We're not asking about
your personal history. We are asking for intel on
the Akatsuki, Sasuke, and Kabuto. And don't get emotionally involved! What good will it do if
you get swayed? F-Forgive me. All right. But only if you
accept my conditions. Conditions?! First of all… I'm starving! If you interrogate someone, you're supposed to give 'em
a fried pork cutlet bowl, right?! What do you mean
"a fried pork cutlet bowl"?! I didn't think there was
a fried pork cutlet bowl shop in the village. Even if there were, would it still be in business under
these circumstances? I heard that Ichiraku has started up
again in temporary quarters. Would ramen do? No way. It has to be
a fried pork cutlet bowl. Then, shall we see if
we can get delivery from outside the village? You can get a fried pork cutlet bowl
from a noodle shop too, can't you? It would take about two days. Cripes! What a pair! – F-Forgive me.
– F-Forgive me. They're alike. What is this? This village is cheerful…
and warm. Just like him. Hey, Naruto!
Haven't seen you for a while. Where were you? Well…umm…
You see…umm… It gets lonely when
you're not around. Your liveliness gives the whole village
the energy to recover. Thank you, thank you. Oh, man… I saw that. Yeah. His head is getting big,
I tell you. Just look at him smiling away.
It's unpleasant. – This is a problem.
– Thank you, thank you. We, the mass media,
have created a terrible monster. If we don't take Naruto down
a peg or two, the village is going to suffer. Yeah. I wonder where he's trying to go. Nowhere good, I'm sure. I've got it! We'll focus in
on the decisive moment! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Wait for me, my love!
I've been waiting to see you! I was right! It's them again. Do they think
I haven't noticed them? They're following me everywhere. Naruto… You're the village hero,
Naruto, aren't you? Huh? No, I'm no hero. By the way,
where are you headed, ey? "Ey"?! You're Konohamaru, aren't you?! I am not Konohamaru, ey! Don't lie! Why you—! What's the big idea?! In that case, I'll do this! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! You can't get away, ey! Harem Jutsu! – What?!
– What?! I want a word
with the village hero, ey! We got a tip that
you have a sweetheart, ey! – Cripes!
– Who is it, ey? Aren't you going on
a date now, ey? The village hero, huh? But… Where are you going, ey?! That time, when Naruto stood up
to Pain in order to protect me… the Nine-Tails appeared in Naruto's body. That's… Do you hate me? I could feel its intense anger, but I couldn't feel any
of Naruto's will. It was like his anger had
taken over his heart. All because of that Nine-Tails. Now that the First Hokage's necklace that Naruto received
from Lady Tsunade is lost, if the Nine-Tails should
ever run loose… even I couldn't stop it. True, it would be
tremendously risky to take on the Akatsuki
with the Nine-Tails inside him. But… – O-Oh no!
– Wait up! Naruto, ey! He is Naruto. He's not the Nine-Tails. For this battle,
we don't need the Nine-Tails. We need Naruto's strength. If it looks like the Nine-Tails
is going to take over, we have to stop it. That's right. This is also a battle in which we must protect Naruto from
the Akatsuki and the Nine-Tails. That's how I…no… I'm sure this is how
all of my classmates feel. We will protect Naruto,
and we will fight with Naruto. I wonder what Lady Tsunade thinks. Is everyone here? We shall now start our war council
to discuss strategy! First, assemble reserves of
ninja tools and foodstuffs. We must divide our shinobi into
main battle units and support forces, and consider how we should
build the platoons within the fighting forces! Bring me the complete list
of all our shinobi! So it's war.
So it's finally come to that. You were invited to this war council,
but you're still young. Keep your ears open
and don't miss a thing. Yeah. I know that. I will make full use of my head
and hammer everything in! I guess I finally lost them. Now, finally, I can enjoy
my love to the fullest! Old man! One large tonkotsu miso
with BBQ pork! Naruto! Huh?! So Grandma Tsunade is fine now? Yes! All right! Is that right?
I'm happy about Lady Tsunade. Okay! Since this is good news,
the ramen is on me! Huh?! Are you sure?! Why don't you have some too, Sakura? No thanks.
I still have more people to notify. Well, I'll see you later, Naruto! Now that that's off my mind,
I feel hungrier than ever! Okay! I'm eating my fill today. One bowl, two bowls, three bowls! Here you go! It's a special tonkotsu miso
with BBQ pork slices to celebrate the Hokage's recovery! Whoa! Thank you for the… Oh? He disappeared. …food! I'm surprised he dug right
into the food. Looks like he really loves
my bug cooking! What am I doing here again? I did a Reverse Summoning on you. The Great Lord Elder will
divine your future, Naruto-boy. Divine? Follow me. Don't throw it up! I have brought him. Hey! Long time no see,
Giant Gramps Sage! It was indeed I who
summoned you…er…umm… Who're you again? Naruto Uzumaki! I wish you'd hurry up and
learn my name, Giant Gramps Sage! Oh, that's right, that's right.
It's Naruto. Do we have to go through
this every time? Listen, Naruto. I have seen
a prophecy involving you. A prophecy?
Okay, I'm ready for it. In that case, listen carefully. You will soon be meeting
an octopus. An octopus? Why an octopus? Well, I couldn't see too clearly, but I'm sure
they were octopus arms. And then, it will come to pass that you will fight a young man
whose power lies in his eyes. And… Yeah… I know. What do you mean, "you know"? I don't plan on changing. Nor am I interested
in understanding you. And I don't plan on dying! You're the one
who's going to die! If I die, we both die, Sasuke. Fine then! I'll kill you first. It's clear you still haven't
acknowledged me yet. Enough, Naruto. I'll take Sasuke on. You have your precious dream
of becoming the Hokage. I can't let Sasuke take
you down with him. How can I become the Hokage
if I can't even save one friend?! I'll fight… Sasuke! So you saw it? Yeah. That young man whose power
lies in his eyes… Do you know who that is?! Yeah, and I've already
made up my mind. Gerotora… I also saw a dream where
you stored yourself inside Naruto. W-What?! Give him the Fourth Hokage's seal. I have no choice but to do
as you say, Great Lord Elder. What is this? It is the key left by
the Fourth Hokage that locks and unlocks
the sealing jutsu on your belly! With this you can let
the Nine-Tails run free, if that's what you want. Press on that square area
with your hand. With this, you will have
the means to perfect that jutsu that Jiraiya was talking about. The key to release… the Nine-Tails' seal. Are you unsure, Naruto? In battle, feelings of hatred
can come out.

 So I thought I didn't want
the Nine-Tails' power anymore.

 But I need the Nine-Tails' chakra
to fight Sasuke.

 I can't hide from that forever.

 No use getting depressed!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Storage"

 I'm going to conquer
this thing, Dad! Tune in again!

 Where'd he go? I'm adapting to the power. It feels good. This isn't bad. I think I'll stir things up a little. Storage

 What are you waiting for? Press the Storing Square! You’re unsure, right, Naruto? I can’t say that I blame you. What do you mean? Lord Fukasaku… The Nine Tails gets its power
by merging its chakra with its will. CHAKRA
WILL



To control this power, CHAKRA
WILL




you must isolate
only the Nine Tails' chakra, CHAKRA
WILL




assimilate it into your own chakra
and make it your own power. But it's easier said than done. If you pull out the Nine Tails' chakra,
you also draw out its will. The Nine Tails' will is a mass of hatred
that binds itself tightly to chakra. No matter how hard you try
to shield yourself, it will find some hatred that
you have buried deep inside and it will try to overtake you. In other words, CHAKRA
WILL




controlling the Nine Tails' power
means taking its will and its chakra and completely separating the two
with your own strong will which should harbor no hatred. The Fourth Hokage made
the Nine Tails' seal in a way that allows a small amount of its chakra
to leak out of the cage in hopes that it would naturally
become one with Naruto’s own chakra. It is known as the Eight Trigram
Sealing Formula and it creates a double-interface
Tetragram Seal. But if this key is used to
open the Tetragram Seal, you could pull out all of
the Nine Tails’ chakra! And that means all of
the Nine Tails' will would tag along with all
of its chakra! And as soon as Naruto’s will
loses to the Nine Tails’ will…. The Nine Tails will be
completely resurrected! How terrible. And has the key ever been used? A while ago, the Tetragram Seal
was weakening. So in order to control Naruto, who was starting to transform into
the Nine Tails during training, Jiraiya used the key to
tighten the seal on him. This should hold for a while. Just a while, huh? What's the matter, Pervy Sage? Jiraiya was greatly concerned. If the Fourth Hokage's Sealing Formula
was beginning to weaken, there was no telling when Naruto would
transform into the Nine Tails again. I guess I'll try it. Huh?! A toad came out of your mouth! Don't be so hard on me, Jiraiya! You just summoned me
a while ago. I need a favor.
Will you hear me out, Gerotora? It's Naruto's Tetragram Seal. Hey hey… You just tightened the seal. Do you want it tighter? No, the reverse. I want to loosen it just a little bit. Wha—?! Jiraiya wanted the seal to be opened
deliberately for just a short while in order to drill Naruto into developing
the power to resist the Nine Tails' will. But it didn't work. I didn't mean to hurt Pervy Sage. What? Giving up already. This training…is impossible. I'm disappointed in you.
Calling it quits so soon. Remember when I told you that
you reminded me of the Fourth Hokage? You are the shinobi who
inherited the Rasengan, the jutsu developed by
the Fourth Hokage himself. You need to shape up! You don’t know how happy I was when I learned the Rasengan,
the Fourth Hokage's jutsu. I had taken over the
Fourth Hokage's jutsu, which was my dream…my goal. But… Compared to the time when
I was learning the Rasengan, this training means nothing. I guess mastering the Rasengan
was a miracle for you. Maybe I was expecting too much. Sure, I know what a great shinobi
the Fourth Hokage was. That’s for sure. He's totally different than
someone like you, who gets so excited about
mastering one measly jutsu. Unlike you, my foolish apprentice,
he was a true prodigy. And the jutsu he developed
was extraordinary. Even I couldn't grasp the ninjutsu
he developed. Even you, Pervy Sage? And not even the successive Hokage. His jutsu was that extraordinary? I knew it.
Becoming the Hokage is impossible. But there is just one shinobi with the potential to master
such an extraordinary jutsu. That is you, Naruto! Me? Yes. You possess the Nine Tails' chakra
and only you can master that jutsu. A jutsu that only I can grasp? Is that… That's right. The Fourth Hokage left it
solely for your sake. It is his legacy to you. The Fourth Hokage's legacy? And it's just for me? Naruto! Will you undergo training to gain
mastery over your chakra control? Yes! The harder I try to become strong, the tighter the grip of
the Nine Tails' will becomes. He totally ignores my will and
tries to hurt everyone in my path. That was the result of opening
Naruto's key just a tiny bit. So that's the reason for the scar
on Jiraiya-boy’s chest. And then what happened? Nothing good. Long ago, when I fought Orochimaru, I relied on the Nine Tails' power
and relinquished my will. Don’t talk about Sasuke,
in front of me, like he belongs to you! Hearing about Sasuke made me angry. Before I knew it, I lost myself. Captain Yamato told me not
to rely on the Nine Tails' chakra and to use my own strength
to fight. Everything is fine during training
with Captain Yamato, since he can restrain Jinchuriki. But during a fight,
feelings of hate are bound to creep up. So I figured, I’d forget about
using the Nine Tails' power. If I can't suppress
the Nine Tails' will with my own… I don't need a power
that hurts people like the Pervy Sage and Sakura. I had my mind made up. But… When Hinata got hurt by Pain… I was so mad and bitter. Rather than not using it… My heart latched onto
the Nine Tails' will on its own. Right now, I feel safe, since
Fourth Hokage's seal has been tightened. But it might act up again at anytime. Yet in order to fight Sasuke, I have to use
the Nine Tails' chakra. I'm the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki, after all. I can't hide from that forever. I sealed half of the Nine Tails' chakra
inside of you, because I believed
you could control its power. Right, Dad? Hurting my friends… Giving in to hatred… It's no use getting hesitant. I understand now just how dangerous
it is to release the Nine Tails' chakra. But he has the Fourth Hokage's love  and that sheer gutsiness
that Jiraiya instilled in him. Contract complete.
I'm going into storage! Huh? Going into storage? You don't need to do a thing.
Just keep your mouth open. Mouth? Yes. Now say “ahh.” Wider. Here I go…into storage. Hey! Open wider! Are you going to let me go
into storage?! Why through my mouth?! It's slimy and feels awful. Okay, storage complete! I'm taking you back to
Hidden Leaf Village! After that, we'll have to
look for the octopus. Oh, right… You prophesied that
I would encounter an octopus. Where is this octopus?
Can't you give more clues? It’s not clear,
but it's a solitary island. People don't go near it. It's like a paradise for creatures. To me, it seems it would be
a fun resort. And there, the octopus should be
of help to you. In any case, you will find your way. Right! There’s no mistake,
it’s Kabuto’s doing. This method of killing… Kabuto is becoming more
like Orochimaru. But why would he leave
a trail like this? He would… Is this deliberate? What does he intend to do? No doubt Kabuto is carrying
on Orochimaru's will. Now, is he going after
the Hidden Leaf or the Akatsuki? Let’s start with the greetings,
shall we, Tobi? No… You call yourself Madara now. You did well to find this place. I roamed from country to country as a spy and I once belonged to the Akatsuki. Don't underestimate my intel network. You were once one of Sasori's spies. You are a traitor to the Akatsuki. This is… Reanimation Jutsu. The Forbidden Jutsu known only to
the Second Hokage and Lord Orochimaru. Now, I'm the third one. And I have surpassed
the previous two. This performance is dedicated to you. So that you would believe
in my power and trust in me. Rest assured. I did not come here to fight. What do you want? I want us to join forces. Join forces? How will that benefit me? I understand you intend
to start a war soon. I'm offering to provide
more military might. With these here… Itachi. Sasori. Deidara. Kakuzu. And Nagato. They each have formidable strength. And I have even more up my sleeve. And in exchange? Sasuke Uchiha. What are you plotting? Nothing really. I am only interested in
the pure truth behind ninjutsu. And I need Sasuke
to pursue this. I need a young, live,
sensitive Uchiha. And if I refuse? Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation. Th-This is… Surely, you didn't think that
I would come unprepared. Yes. You can’t refuse. Why you… Where did you get that? I have my means. Don't worry. I haven't told
anyone about this. What's so funny? Kabuto Yakushi. Never did I imagine that
you would come this far. Arguing with you now will
only weaken our side. You came here,
waiting for the perfect opportunity. You are very careful indeed. What do you mean? So be it.
We will join forces with you. But only on the condition that
I hand Sasuke over to you after victory in this war is assured. You will not be allowed to
see Sasuke until then. You understand things clearly. I expected no less
from Madara Uchiha. Your vessel is unique. And you are insolent. I’ll reformulate my strategy after
I confirm your battle strength. Follow me. He brought corpses all the way
to this desolate place? Judging from the way
the shinobi's bodies are strewn about, I'll bet there's something up ahead. I originally thought we'd pursue him
by way of Hidden Waterfall, and back to Hidden Leaf Village. But it's like he wants us
to follow him. I don't get it. Is it a trap then? What do we do? Tokuma! Use your Byakugan
towards two o'clock! Right! Byakugan! Captain Mitarashi! This is… What's the matter? It's not just Kabuto! He's with a masked member
of the Akatsuki! The two of them are going through
some kind of underground entrance! What?! A masked man? Is it the one who calls
himself Madara? Does this mean
we found his hideout? What is he doing with Kabuto? Have they joined forces? Did Kabuto purposely lure us here? In order to show us
Madara's hideout? But why? If they’ve joined forces… I don't know yet. But we need to send word to
the village immediately! Hide them? Naruto and Bee can
lend much strength to this battle.

 Why hide them away?

 The Five Great Nations
joined together and

 our aim in this war is to
protect those two.

 Your sole dissent as Hokage
is not sufficient.

 We will decide this with
majority rule.

 You child! Naruto is—

 I know him quite well.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Five Kage's Decision"

 It’s fine! Tune in again!

 You're saying that the Fourth
Great Ninja War is about to start? Even if it is Madara Uchiha, can he really take on
the Five Great Nations? Wake up! Madara Uchiha leads the Akatsuki. Just one of their members, Nagato, was able to destroy
Hidden Leaf Village! Have you already forgotten that?! I agree with Lady Tsunade. The Akatsuki already have
the Tailed Beasts from the One Tail to the Seven Tails. If they intend to use them
as military weapons, then we must consider their strength
to be far greater than Nagato's. And if that is the case,
the Five Great Nations… no, the entire world is
in danger of ruin. We cannot delay action any longer. All right. But do you know
where Uchiha Madara is? We have a general idea
of the location. The Mitarashi Unit just
reported in and they confirmed spotting someone who
fits the description of Madara Uchiha. I see. They are presently working
to get more solid intel. It doesn't rhyme. Isn't there a nice phrase? Unless we are sure about
the enemy's headquarters, and where their hideout is, it will be difficult to launch
an effective surprise attack. And so, we will first dispatch
a reconnaissance team. All right. – To maximize their efforts, we will have
– "All right," eh?  – three surprise attack formations.
–  Lacks originality. To ensure success, – each formation must be comprised of
– What if I switch it around like… – expert shinobi from the Five Great Nations.
– Right-o? Right-o… And then I add
a little rap flavor and… Yo right-o. Yo right-o, yo right-o, yo right-o yo… This gives us
a pretty clear picture of the Hidden Cloud's military strength. Lucky for us,
the Eight Tails is a fool. It's not working. This phrase
is making me mad! Can't figure it out. We don't have current intel
about the enemy, so we must rely on intel from
the others to assess the situation. So we're to go empty-handed and depend on intel
from other villages? Will they even share their data? If they refuse to divulge
what they know, then the Allied Shinobi Force
is meaningless. We'll just have to trust them. We don't have time to waste. At this every moment, Madara Uchiha is preparing for war. All right! We will hold a meeting of
the Allied Shinobi Force in three days! Send word to each village! Shortly, I will make
an announcement to everyone in the village about
the impending Fourth Great Ninja War. Fourth Great Ninja War… You didn't know this yet, Sakura. But Madara Uchiha
has declared war. It's not a war between
nations this time. The Five Great Nations
have joined forces for a war, the likes of which has
never been seen. The enemy is… None other than the Akatsuki. The Akatsuki…
We're really going to fight Sasuke. When the fighting breaks out,
many will be stricken with anxiety. It will be your job to monitor
their mental state. Circulate among each team and
report anything that you deem necessary. Do not hide anything. I understand. Also, make sure you keep
an eye on Naruto. I cannot have him acting recklessly. In this war,
the Akatsuki's goal is Naruto. What's going on, Shizune? Well, just now… Naruto suddenly disappeared
from Ichiraku. What?! You don't suppose the enemy… It's impossible for Naruto to
be kidnapped from this village! Find Naruto immediately! The Five Kage's Decision

 See you, Giant Gramps Sage. All right, I'm sending you back. I'm back. Where'd you go? I thought you suddenly disappeared,
and now you're back! I had something to do. Oh, Naruto! They said you suddenly disappeared
and everyone's in an uproar. Huh? No kidding! I never thought I'd run into you here. Oh hey!
Give me your autograph! Could you make it out to my kid.
He's a big fan of yours. Autograph? The hero of the Hidden Leaf. The kid who created a miracle,
Naruto Uzumaki. Give me your autograph too! What is it? You refuse? Oh no, but I'm not used
to that sort of thing. I don't have a clue what to sign. Everyone’s making a fuss
over him lately as the miracle kid. But until just recently,
it was just the opposite.  I can’t blame the boy. Gentlemen, will you let him eat
a bowl of ramen before that? Oh, sure… Yes! I finally get to eat! Naruto! Oh Sakura! Where have you been?! Where? I was suddenly
summoned and… Just come with me right now! Lady Tsunade and everyone else
are worried about you! Oww… Sakura!
Let me eat my ramen! That can wait. With the Great Lord Elder? Yeah, he used
a Reverse Summoning Jutsu. Jeez, after all the trouble… Lord Fukasaku could at least
notify me first. Still, it's a relief that
you're okay, Naruto. Yup, I'm alive and well. But why did the Great Lord Elder
summon you? Giant Gramps Sage had
a prophecy for me too. Like the one he foretold to Jiraiya? What did the Great Lord Elder say? Well… What's the matter? I'm gonna go to some resort
and encounter an octopus. Huh? An octopus? What is that supposed to mean? Well, this octopus is gonna cooperate
with me somehow. Giant Gramps Sage didn't know
the details either. And… he said that I'm going to
end up fighting Sasuke. Sasuke? But I'm already prepared for that. Naruto… Sakura, it's all right. Just let me deal with Sasuke. It's quiet. I know. So peaceful. Huh? No, it's not. Well sure, the village that
Pain destroyed is being rebuilt, and Lady Tsunade has
come out of her coma. But as for Sasuke, there's only talk that Naruto
will do something. And there's gonna be a war, right? How did you know that? I'm not stupid.
I can tell by watching the jonin. I guess so. The fact is war is right
at our doorstep. I see… I figured as much. Yeah. This is fight is going
to be something we… I mean, no shinobi
has ever experienced. I mean, the Five Great Nations
are joining forces for the first time to crush the Akatsuki. It's the start of
the Fourth Great Ninja War. The Fourth Great Ninja War. Aren't you scared, Shikamaru? Sure, I'm scared. But this time, it doesn't matter how scared
we are or how hard it'll be. Our enemy, the Akatsuki,
is made up of members so skilled that it took just one of them, Pain,
to destroy Hidden Leaf Village. And the abilities of their leader,
Madara, are shrouded in mystery. Madara already has seven
Tailed Beasts in his possession. If he unleashes
all of them at once, who knows if
the Five Great Nations can win. The very existence of
the ninja world is at stake. Each and every shinobi
will have to do his best in order for us to win. Choji, I'm counting on
your strength! Shikamaru… I wonder if
I can do my best? Still, it's hard to take
this all in, huh? Are you okay? You wanted to know what
to expect from war. I'm fine. But nothing can prepare you
for the real battlefield. The cries of the wounded,
the smell of blood… It's impossible not to
be affected by that. And yet, a Medical Ninja must
maintain composure at all times. Everyone fights hard, believing that we will be
there to save their lives. I understand. That's why I wanted to… to know. Well, I've rambled on enough. Damn it. A poor talker like me
lecturing you, it’s not my style. If we both end up dying… You won’t be an Uchiha and
I won’t be the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki. We'll be free of all our burdens. And we'll finally be able to understand
each other in the next world. Naruto…you… If both Naruto and Sasuke
are seriously wounded… which one will I save first? Found you! Be quiet! Master, what's the meaning of this? Don't scare us like that. I'm Killer - Bee - Quiet! That has a nice cadence. – And…
– What is it? ENKA CONCERT These are for us? To sell?! I had interference from Brother
in that last recital. This time, I'm gonna nail it. A recital? Who's gonna wanna buy these? Are you that against hearing me sing? You fools! You idiots! No, it's not that… Okay, Master! I'll sell tickets
even if it kills me! I'm counting on you! You all came quickly. The situation calls for quick action. Princess Tsunade.
Are you really all right? This is the perfect opportunity
to hand things over to a youngster. You're old too. Speak for yourself,
you Fence-Sitter geezer! Setting aside the matter of Danzo, I'm relieved that you are back
as the Hokage, Lady Tsunade. Let us be done with the greetings
and get right to business. First on the agenda are the Jinchuriki of the
Eight Tails and Nine Tails. Then we will go on to any intel relating to the enemy's headquarters
and military strength. My shinobi have pinned
down a location that may be the enemy’s stronghold. But it may be a trap. We have no choice but to wait
for more intel on this. I also have a reconnaissance team
gathering intel. We need to sort through the intel
from each village quickly. How about forming a separate unit
within the Allied Force that only handles intel? Good idea!
Share and share alike! That goes without saying! If each nation becomes driven
by self-interest, the Akatsuki will pull the rug out
from under us. So, where will we hide
the crucial Jinchuriki? Hide them? What is it? Naruto and Bee can lend much
strength to this battle. Why hide them away? I thought so as well. But those two are what the enemy
is after in this war. Considering what could happen,
we cannot let them participate. It was decided at the last meeting, but you, of course,
were still ill. Our enemy is Madara! If we hold back battle strength and
lose the prospect of victory, we are not going to get another chance. We must hit them with
everything we've got… The Five Great Nations
joined together and our aim in this war is
to protect those two. Your sole dissent as Hokage
is not sufficient. We will decide this
with majority rule. You child! Naruto is— I know him quite well. Putting us through
all this trouble! If it's for a friend,
he gets too reckless. That is exactly why. Before we even talk
about military strength, the five Kage must reach a consensus. Otherwise, there will be no victory. I agree, Lady Tsunade. It's fine! The Slug Princess is back
to her impudent self. It's proof that she is well. We will now need to decide
where to hide the Eight Tails and Nine Tails. Any objections, Hokage? I understand.
Get on with it! I have a place in mind. And it is appropriately located
in the Hidden Cloud, which has not produced
any Akatsuki members. I set it aside, just in case. Why do you need to speak
in private? I need a favor. A favor? I understand that
your younger brother, Bee, has the Eight Tails completely
under control. I want Bee to teach Naruto. About how to control the Nine Tails. How convenient for you. If that brat named Naruto learns to completely manipulate
the Nine Tails he will be the ultimate weapon
for the Hidden Leaf. And you want me to readily
agree to that? I know all that. But this is not the time to be arguing
about our own interests! We are up against Madara Uchiha! The time will come when
we will have no choice but to use Bee and Naruto's powers! It will be too late if we wait until then! Don't shout so much. Is that any way to make a request? I’m sorry. You have a point though. And, I considered that ages ago. What?! What are you saying? The place I'm sending those two
isn't just a hideout. I said I set it aside, didn’t I? Long ago, Bee and I trained
on that island. S-rank mission?! You're assigning me to
an important mission like that? Yes. This is a mission that
only you can undertake. You and Yamato will go
to a certain place in the Hidden Cloud region. Is that the resort? The Great Lord Elder's prophecy
was accurate. It seems that is the place
he foresaw. Then I'm gonna see the octopus
at this resort island? I feel sorta bad! Everyone's so busy and
I get to go to a resort. You fool! You are going
on a mission! I know. Just joking, just joking. But about going to this place
that was prophesied… Is it connected to the other one? That I'll fight with Sasuke? That, I don't know. However, we are on the verge of war! Hence, this S-rank mission. When you get to the site,
you will follow Yamato's orders. Okay! I understand! You can count on me
for this S-rank mission! Dress casually for enka. Yup, I look pretty good. Where is Bee?! W-What's up, Brother?! You surprised me too much. You're going on a mission.
Leave immediately! What's with that get-up?! Let's go! The concert is in three days. PASSION ON FIRE
LIVE ENKA CONCERT
TICKETS ON SALE NOW


No way we can sell these. If we don't sell them… It'll be "You fools. You idiots.
You worthless jerks." And we'll end up tied to
the front-row seats and forced to listen to
Master's singing forever. We'll end up with calluses
on our ears. Okay! So we just have
to sell the tickets, right?! But if we do sell them all,
he'll be so grateful he'll still give us first-row seats and we'll have to listen to Master
sing for the rest of our lives, and we'll still get calluses! So do we sell the tickets or not?! I don't know what to do either! The time has finally come.

 Just as Giant Gramps Sage
prophesied.

 I’m going to go search
for an octopus and

 train to learn how to control
the Nine Tails’ power.

 And see Sasuke again.

 Naruto, are you ready?

 Yes!

 Hey young man.
We depart now!

 Next time:
"The Young Man and the Sea"

 We’ll set sail for
the Land of Lightning!
 
 Tune in again!

 There we go. All right! Okay, storage complete! I'm taking you back to
Hidden Leaf Village! After that, we'll have to
look for the octopus. Just like Giant Gramps Sage predicted, I'm going to look for an octopus and train to control
the Nine Tails' power. And I'll meet Sasuke once more. Okay, let's… Now, young man… Time to go! The Young Man and the Sea

 Wow! Look, it's the sea! Yahoo! The sea is great! That is the Land of Fire's only port. From there, we'll depart for
the Hidden Cloud Village in the Land of Lightning. Say… What's this top-secret mission
that Granny Tsunade mentioned? It's called a top-secret mission
because it's a secret, Naruto. Oh, come on! Don't say that. You can tell me. I’ll explain later. I guess he still hasn’t come up
with a cover story to fool Naruto. Lady Tsunade, why did you assign
Naruto on an S-rank mission at such a critical time? Not only that, you sent him to
the Land of Lightning by sea. Yes… The Akatsuki is targeting Naruto. I chose a difficult sea
voyage on purpose in order to prevent
the enemy from finding him. What will Naruto be doing in Hidden Cloud Village
in the Land of Lightning? I'm leaving that up to Raikage. Wow! That's a grand sailing ship
you readied for us! Actually… Our Hidden Leaf ship
is the one next to it. That one over there. Aw man, it looks so shabby. It's a top-secret mission. A big ship would attract attention, right? It's better to go to the island
on a boat like this. I don't see any of the seamen. About that… They refused to set
sail into the open sea. What? Don't tell me you were
stingy on the pay?! No, it's not that. Well… Tell me. I won't get upset. Well, they say there is a monster
out there that attacks any boat
that tries to set sail. A monster? Oh, boy… Looks like I drew
the short end of the stick. I don't know what's going to appear,
but I'll crush it to bits! I don’t know if it was a good idea for
Guy to make such a promise. We don’t even know what
kind of monster it is. I’m sure he’ll be fine. See? He looks so eager
doing warm-up exercises! Are you all right, Guy? Th-This is nothing. I didn't know the boat
would sway so much. My stomach is a little shocked,
that’s all. How can you crush a monster
in that condition? Sure I can! I may not look it, but when the time comes,
I'll be strong. We're in open sea. I don't see anything. Damn monster! Did it get scared
and run away after seeing me, the Leaf’s Burning Hurricane? A monster! Is that a sword? A type of Summoning Animal? But I don’t sense any jutsu user. Could it be a Wild Summoning Animal? It’s coming back! Avoid it! There's not enough time! Stay back, Aoba!
I'll stop it! Guy, behind you! What?! I won't make it! I got you! Damn monster! Don't be so reckless, pal. My name is Yusuke! Who the hell are you and how can
you stand on the ocean surface?! I'm Naruto, a ninja from
the Hidden Leaf. Leave the rest to me! I can't weave
my signs like this! Wood Style: Giant Forest! You have to undo your jutsu
or you'll be drawn in! Quickly, take him and go! Scattering Crow Jutsu! BIG CATCH Why would there be
a Summoning Animal in a spot like that? Maybe it survived
the Third Great Ninja War? No wonder the seamen are scared. That thing's been living there
for about 15 years. I see. Normally, when the ninja who
is contracted with it dies, the animal returns to its own world. But why is that one acting up like that? Maybe the war has not ended
for that Summoning Animal. Yeah. Your ninja wars are such a nuisance! Because of that thing, all the cowardly seamen refuse
to go to sea anymore! Cowardly? What were you thinking,
doing something so dangerous?! A fisherman's job is to catch fish. I thought I was gonna get rid
of him once and for all, only to have you interfere! If I hadn't saved you,
you'd be fish food about now. You should just leave
that thing to us and stop acting so recklessly. Shut up. If anyone beats that thing,
it's gonna be me, Yusuke! I’m not asking for much. If I only had a sturdier boat that could withstand that
marlin's body blows. And an internal-combustion engine
to match that marlin's power. And maybe a fishing rod that
has a lure and won't snap. That's asking for quite a lot. Tell me. How come you're so determined
to get that marlin? Is that your dad? We're dead serious about
fighting that fish. A guy who'd lose… isn't worth being called
a father or a son! Captain Yamato,
isn't there anything we can do? Like what? Like lending him a hand. I want Yusuke to avenge his dad. But you have an S-rank mission… I’ve been moved to tears, Yamato! Let’s give him a helping hand!
Come on, do it! I’ll do it too! Well, as long as that monster
is there, we can't set sail. You see! If that marlin is
a Summoning Animal, then we shinobi are to blame
for Yusuke's misfortune. And it's not like that marlin
is here because it wants to be. Okay, okay. I understand. All right! BIG CATCH Yusuke! We have a fishing rod too! Naruto… What do you think? I tried making them
with the data I had available. I have no quarrel with
the boat or the rod. But this is not a motorized boat. Without an internal combustion engine
that can match the marlin's power, it's useless. You can leave that to me! When it comes to power, no one can compete with I,
Might Guy, the Noble Blue Beast! So what do you say? Can't you mind your own business? With all this, you're taking
the thrill out of the fight. Well, aren’t you stubborn? Giant marlin spotted 30 degrees
to the right! Hey, go around in front of him! You got it! We're up front! Okay, I'm going to release the lure. Hey, what is that?! It's a special lure made in proportion
to its huge size. I meant, why does it look
just like me? You're showy and look like
you'd be good bait. No! I'm gonna get eaten! Faster! We have to make it think
this lure is nice and fresh! Leave it to me! Eight Inner Gates! Second Gate, Gate of Rest! Open! Bushy Brow Sensei! Faster! Fourth Gate, Gate of Pain…
Fifth Gate, Gate of Closing… Open! Come on, come on, come on! Bull's-eye! He took the bait! Oh, that hurts my heart. Say, we have to reel it in quickly. You idiot. If we did that,
the line would snap. We'll let it play
and wait until it tires out. We'll run out of line like this! I know that. Let it pull the boat! Can you keep up with it? Nothing is impossible for me! You don't need to row anymore. Just follow the marlin’s lead
and steer the boat. Good. I was reaching my limit. Swim, swim…
Use up all your strength. It's got amazing stamina
to swim at this speed. But it will eventually use up
the energy to resist. Then the real fight begins. It's finally showing signs of exhaustion. Yusuke! Stay out of my way! This fight is between him and me! I know that! Here we go. This time... This time for sure. Guess it’s time to help out. Don't help him! Yusuke will get his revenge
with his own two hands. Oh dear… I guess we have no choice. All right, just a little more! Give it up already! He still has so much strength. This isn't good! Yusuke! You avenged your dad. Yeah! Why didn't that Summoning Animal
return to its birthplace? Easy there. I'll get it out. This is… It's a Demon Wind Shuriken
from the Hidden Leaf. So it was a victim of
the Third Great Ninja War, after all. If possible, we'd like to return it
to its birthplace. Sure, do whatever you like with it. Our one-on-one duel is over. No more grudges. I can’t take it anymore!
Get me off this ship!

 Get a hold of yourself,
Bushy Brow Sensei!

 But these waves are
indeed hard to take!

 Then what are we going to do?

 Get me off! Get me off, please!

 It’s going to be off course,

 but there should be
an island up ahead.

 That’s it. Let’s stop there!
Set sail towards north-northeast!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“The Ninja of Benisu”

 Naruto? What are you doing here?

 Tune in again!

 I can't take it anymore!
Get me off this ship! G-Get me off!
Get me off, please! Get a hold of yourself,
Bushy Brow Sensei! Guy Sensei may be prone
to seasickness, but these waves are
indeed hard to take! Yes, I think I’m going to… What are we going to do? Get me off.
Get me off, please. I really… Come on,
it’s just a little seasickness. What a bunch of wimps! Still, all this reeling
is hard to take. We should dock somewhere and wait for Guy and
the weather to get better. You're right. We'll go slightly off course,
but there's an island to the east. I remember it. An uninhabited island
in a neutral zone. Let's see… Here it is! That's it! Let's stop there! Okay? Okay? Whoa! B-Better hurry!
He’s not going to make it! Changing course! Set sail towards north-northeast! I’m gonna throw up! The Ninja of Benisu

 Get a hold of yourself! It's Naruto! Hey, over here! What are you doing
in a place like this? Sakura?! Those waves were pretty bad. It was awful.
Everyone was getting sick! So you're here to give
Guy Sensei a rest? Anyway, what's your mission here? Right. On Lady Tsunade's orders… We're going to
the eastern sea too? The Fourth Great Ninja War
will soon begin. Before that… I want to gather secret herbs  as well as ingredients
to make food pills. Okay, here. Nanakusa Island. It is a treasure trove
of medicinal herbs. I've marked the sites where
they can be found on the map. Mandra Plant, Energy Ginseng,
Red Newt, Huge Mato Plant… There certainly are a lot. Where is this? Go there if you have time. Don't go out of your way. Right. So you're the captain? Guy Sensei fell asleep. Preparations are ready! You can leave anytime. So, you're the remnants of
Team 10 minus Shikamaru. We're not remnants! At least call us the leftovers! You should talk, Naruto. Team 7 got scattered
because of you. Sai's on a different mission too. I see. I guess so.
Everyone's doing something. Shouldn't I be doing something too? You have a big mission
ahead of you. This journey is specifically
for that purpose. I know, but… I have an idea, Naruto. You can't set sail until
Guy Sensei feels better, right? Come and help us. Huh? Gathering herbs? Yes. Just gathering herbs.
Easy, right? Wrong! How many guesses is that?! Huh? Then, this? What are you looking at?! That's totally different. I can't tell at all! This isn't easy at all,
damn it! I should've just stayed back
with those two and kept an eye on Guy Sensei. When Guy Sensei feels better,  we'll need to discuss
our sailing schedule with him. Oh well, if I stayed back,
I'd just be killing time. Here, use this as a sample. Once the war begins,
people will be injured. Maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand. This work is absolutely necessary
in order to treat the wounded. Right. Lady Tsunade said this is a treasure trove
of medicinal herbs, but finding them is harder
than expected. Do you want to change locations? Let's go higher up. We need to find ingredients
for the food pills too. I guess so. We can never have enough. Oh, wait a minute. It’s so bitter! Okay, now I know
what it tastes like! All right! Here I go! Naruto? This one? Nope! This one? Nope! This one? Nope! Huh? Is this it? It sorta tastes different,
and yet, it sorta tastes like it. Strange… You'd think Mandra Plant would be
growing everywhere around here. Maybe the weather was bad. Huh?! Energy Ginseng! Oh, there it is. It's growing in
a nice, orderly way. These will make great food pills. Just a minute! Who are you?! I’m sorry, but we found that
patch of ginseng first. From your headbands, I presume you are
from the Hidden Leaf. And you are? I guess people from
the Great Nations wouldn’t know anything
about us little country folk. We are shinobi from
Benisu Island in the south. I’m Bando, a jonin. I'm Sada, a genin. I'm Kiji. We heard that war was imminent and came here to
gather medicinal herbs. No wonder… That’s why we
couldn't find anything no matter how
much we looked. You guys picked everything. Yes, we've covered
just about every site. However, I know that
leaves you in a bind. Here. Right. This is… Thank you. It will benefit
the Allied Shinobi Forces too! I'm glad you are pleased. Well… Okay then! Let's see…click, click, and click. How about this much per bunch? Huh? Well… You Hidden Leaf people drive
a hard bargain. Now this is as low as I can go.
How about this? You expect to get paid for this? You're not giving it to us? Huh? Give me a break. If we did that, a small nation
like ours couldn't survive. Fine, if the Hidden Leaf isn't
interested in purchasing from us, we can sell it to other
Feudal Lords in other lands. Shinobi aren’t the only ones
who get wounded in war. Knowing that, you still intend
to make money?! You receive money for the missions
you undertake too! You separate them
into different ranks and put a price on them! Forgive me. But please understand. We need funds for
our own self-defense. Here we go! Here we go! – Pluck one for money, here we go!
– Pluck one for money, here we go! – Pluck two for money, all right!
– Pluck two for money, all right! – Pluck three for money,
– Pluck three for money, – here we go!
– here we go! – Pluck four for money, all right!
– Pluck four for money, all right! What should we do? There's no way we can complete
our mission like this. And yet, we can't just
seize their stash. Of course not. Now that we have
a shinobi alliance, we can't start trouble
with other shinobi. I don't know why you're
so concerned, Sakura. This island is a treasure trove
of medicinal herbs, right? What's the big deal if someone took
the herbs from this area? Exactly. Rare herbs are still
waiting to be picked. But don't think that
they will be easy to obtain. Most of the sites
are quite dangerous. Just leave it to me! Naruto?! What's wrong? Please excuse us. Do be careful! Oh, hey! He went ahead! What happened, Naruto?! My belly…hurts. Huh? How can I get a bellyache from
eating medicinal herbs? Medicinal herbs? Maybe you ate some poisonous herbs
instead of medicinal herbs! H-Huh? Naruto! Hurry! I know, but… There should be some
Huge Mato Plant growing around here. I wonder if they've already
picked them. I hope that’s not true. What?! Let's hurry. At this rate,
it's first-come, first-serve. Giant Mato Plant. Oh, there's still a few. Maybe they left them for us. Let's pick 'em. Don't, Naruto. Why not? They left them so they can reseed. Leaving behind the roots is
the basic rule when harvesting. What? But isn’t this for our sake? Let's go to the next site. We’re going upstream
to look for Red Newt. Hurry! No kidding. – Okay!
– Okay! So long! Those guys! – Hold it!
– Wait! There's a note. "Do not cross this bridge." "Only for the exclusive use
of the Benisu.” We're gonna cross anyway! Hey Naruto! Maybe it's another trap. Like I care!
Besides, my stomach feels better! M-My entire body feels numb
and I can't move. Hey, look. Look what's wrapped around here. Isn’t that a paralyzing herb? It was a trap, after all. I knew it. No, hey… I mean…
C-Can you help me? Naruto?! What about your side? I don't see any. Hey, I found a Red Newt. Found it! A Red Newt! It’s just one though. Judging from its size,
it's not fully grown yet. I have no choice but to release it. They beat us to it again. We used up a lot of time. That’s right. Why are we taking it
easy like this? It's cold. Let's get going to the next spot. Whose fault is it that
we're wasting time?! So? What'll we do? This place is no good. I know. I guess we'll just have to go here…
Hell Valley. Hell Valley? For the mud that gushes out
from underground. It's an Elixir Mud for bruises,
cuts and sprains. However, Lady Tsunade said
not to go out of our way to get it. Go there if you have time. Don't go out of your way. It's probably…very dangerous. Yeah. It's settled then! Let's go to Hell Valley! Now then… What's going on? You guys! You guys better not be
laying another trap! Oh, not at all! We would never do that
to the Hidden Leaf. We were just getting ready
to harvest some plants. We want nothing to do
with you anymore. We're getting the Elixir Mud,
then we’re leaving. Please wait! What is it? Stalling us again? This service is free of charge. Take a look. Gas is being released
intermittently. It's toxic. If you're exposed to it
for a long period of time. Furthermore, there's no pattern
to when it’s released. So the problem is how to get in
to gather the mud. Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Go! I can't breathe! Hot! Oh? All right! The Elixir Mud! I'm taking it! Hot! You gotta have some utensils
to collect this mud! This one's a big gamble. It's sink or swim. Or rather, simply impossible. Thanks to you, I was able
to confirm a route. You intend to go?! I'm not in this business for fun. To survive in a small nation,
we have to take desperate measures. We'll go when the gas stops again. – Right!
– Right! Now! Hey! They're amazing! It's dangerous! Wind Style: Great Breach! Wind Style jutsu?! Way to go! – Got it!
– Got it! Good job!
Let's get out of here! – Right!
– Right! What is that?! Wind Style: Great Breach! Hurry! Run! Run! – Right!
– Right! This is bad! Hey, it's impossible if
that thing’s running! Whoa! W-Wind Style…Great… Keep it going! Why?! Your assistance is unnecessary! If we are indebted
to a Great Nation, who knows what kind of bill
we'll get later! We don't want money for this! I don't trust you! You people have always… Well, this service
is free of charge! Giant Rasengan! I don't know what to say… I… I want to thank you for coming
to our rescue. And…are you sure
we don't owe you any money? I told you. It's on the house. Just because we're shinobi
from another land doesn't make us enemies. But… Sometimes, we have to
put aside our differences and join together. The Allied Shinobi Forces
is just that. But then… Sada, Kiji… There's no charge. Let's just be grateful
for their kindness. Y-Yes. Here, it's on the house, from us. Please take the Elixir Mud. Huh? No kidding? Gee thanks! Yes. And if you like… Please take the medicinal herbs
that we packed up. It's our way of assisting
the Allied Shinobi Forces. Yes! Mission complete! That's a huge help! Thank you very much! You're awesome! Oh no, no. I would say the same about you. This has been
a great learning experience. Hey, thank you! Good luck to you guys! Are you sure about this, Bando? You're letting them
have it for free? Well, it's only until I
call in this debt from the Allied Shinobi Forces. I'm taking a loss now
for a gain later. – Oh...
– Oh... Farewell! It's only for a short while. Thanks to this trip,
I've gotten used to sailing. I really hope so. Naruto! Be careful! And good luck on
your special mission! Right! It is said that it appears
on foggy night such as this.

 Guiding the souls of the dead,
led in by crows…

 a large devil fire lighting
the top of its mast.

 If you come across it,

 you’re doomed to a journey by sea
to the land of the dead.

 Next time:
“The Cursed Ghost Ship”

 It’s here!

 Tune in again!

 You there, maiden. What's the matter? What's wrong, mister? I-It appeared! What appeared? A highwayman? A slasher wanting
to try out their new sword? There have been so many
disturbances lately. No. I-It was a… It's a faceless… What? Faceless? You mean… Faceless like this? Sorry, sorry.
That's my Wood Clone. Captain Yamato, that's going too far. Still, Naruto.
You're such a scaredy cat. Captain Yamato,
your face is bad for my heart. Don't be so upset, Naruto. The fog's so thick,
there's nothing else to do. Yeah, but a grown man like you
telling ghost stories? Something’s wrong with you! You're so easy to scare.
That's why. Stories like that don't
scare me one bit. Okay then,
I'll tell you the best one yet. I've heard that it appears
on days like this. Huh? "It"? It appears, led in by black crows that
guide the souls of dead men. A giant friar's lantern
that lights the mast confirms its presence. The thick, thick fog embodies
the souls of dead people. When you encounter it, the final journey to
the land of the dead begins. That is… the ghost ship. Souls of dead people? D-Don't tell me this fog… Yes. The ghost ship appears
out of fog like this. Just kidding. A ghost ship is
just an old superstition. I thought so.
Of course, there's no such thing. I didn't believe you for a second. You could've fooled me. The wind just picked up. What was that?! This is… A ghost ship?! No way. It can’t be! The Cursed Ghost Ship
 

 You've got to be kidding! Are you seriously gonna
board a ghost ship?! Naruto, there's no such thing
as a ghost ship. There sure is. Look at that. It's exactly how
Captain Yamato described it. It's definitely
a suspicious-looking ship, but marine laws dictate that
lost ships must not be left ignored. The sooner we check it out, the sooner we can get back
to our boat. So give it up. If that's the case, I should have stayed back
with Bushy Brow Sensei. Naruto, it's all about guts! As long as you have guts,
ghosts or whatever are… It's only seasickness.
Get over it with guts. Right, Aoba? W-Wait a minute. Hey Aoba… Captain Yamato… Man, I'm so busy, busy, busy. Hey… My face isn't the floor. Hey. So busy, so busy. Wow. Hey, wait! So busy, so busy! H-Hey! He really is a busy guy. Oh… So that's how you
operate the ship. Hey, you've really made
good use of this brush. Don't touch it! The captain gave it to me.
It's very precious to me. O-Okay, I get it. For a young kid,
you really work hard. Isn't it hard all by yourself? All right! I'll help you! Two is better than one. In fact, a bunch of us will finish
much faster than just two! After all, I don't think I'll get to talk
to you unless you finish your work. Boy, am I tired. Say brother… Huh? My name's Naruto. Naruto… I'm Hishaku. Nice to meet you. You're a ninja, Naruto?
Are you strong? Of course, I'm strong. I'm aiming to become the Hokage. The Hokage? Yup! The strongest and
most important ninja in the village. Is that all? Well, my captain is even greater
than your Hokage. W-What?! The captain is strong and
not just important. He's kind and considerate of others. I'm gonna become
a captain too one day! H-Hold it! My Hokage is strong and
important and kind, and not just considerate,
but generous. And…and… No, my captain is! The Hokage! The captain! The Hokage! The captain! So we both have something
we're aiming for. By the way, teach me that thing. That thing? The way you tapped the brush earlier. That was cool. The captain taught it to me. The captain gave me
this brush too. Can we join in your conversation? I looked around, but it's just an ordinary ship
on the inside, Captain Yamato. It's not a ghost ship. A ghost ship?
That's just a superstition. But… Isn't that made up of human souls? You mean the glow on the mast? Well, among sailors, it's supposed
to be a sign of good luck. That's just static electricity discharging. S-Static electricity? Then what about the crows on the mast? You don't normally find crows
on the ocean. Those aren't crows. They're just seabirds taking a rest. They’re dirty from the ash coming
from the smokestack. Really? Putting aside talk about a ghost ship, we took the liberty of checking
the inside of this ship too. It seems there are no other sailors
on board besides you. What happened to them? A ship this class requires
quite a few deckhands. That's right. Where's the captain who
gave you the brush? Yeah. I used to have shipmates. I presume something happened. Under the sea, lurks something
even more terrifying than some stupid superstition
about a ghost ship. It’s here! It? Oh yes. The legendary sea monster,
the Skeleton Crab! Crab? It's not an ordinary crab! It's huge, the size of a small island. Its shell is rock hard and if you get caught between
its pinchers, it's over. It can pulverize anything! And the barnacles that are
attached on the shell devour humans alive! The captain and the rest of
the crew… They were all killed by it. Naruto! Ninja are strong, right? Please destroy it and avenge
the captain and the others! Captain! Oh no… Captain Yamato! Captain Yamato! That thing’s gonna… Leave it to me, Hishaku! I'll crush that thing! Aoba, take Hishaku back to
the ship with you! And let everyone know about this. But… We don't have time to
stand around and think! One of us has to save Captain Yamato
and stop that monster crab, or notify the others on the ship. Each of us has to do one task. You probably can explain things
to the others more calmly than me, Aoba. He's become so reliable. Okay, I'll take on that job. Naruto, aren't you scared? How can you take on that monster? I told you. I'm aiming to become
the Hokage some day. If it's for my comrades,
I'm not afraid of anything. For your comrades… Hishaku… You're still young. You must live. I'm scared, Captain! Please stay with me, Captain. I've had this from the time
I joined this ship. Take this. Those worn-down bristles
carry my soul in them. If you take it,
I'll know it's in good hands. Captain! I still have work to do. It's my job to stay with
my ship until the end, for the sake of my comrades who
believed in me and stayed with me. That's the duty of a ship's captain. Just you wait.
I'll get revenge for you! That's Naruto Uzumaki, the hero who saved
the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto Uzumaki. Let's get back to our ship. You good-for-nothing…
Going around threatening everyone! If you're not a ghost,
then you don't scare me one bit! Rasengan! Damn! That monster crab has
a hard shell, all right! This thing… It's not only strong,
but it's fast too. Aoba, our ship is swaying badly.
What's going on? We have to get out of
this area immediately. Naruto is buying us
some time right now. Captain… Grant me the courage. Captain Yamato! I can't do anything big to settle this. I have to save Captain Yamato quickly! Damn it. This is bad! Everyone, please lend me
your strength! They got it. I wonder if Hishaku did it. That helped! Captain Yamato! I was careless. To get caught by something like this…
I'm embarrassed. Don't worry about it. Hey, Naruto! Captain Yamato, now! That shell is unbelievably hard. I see. So I should aim for the soft area. Wood Style Jutsu! Now, Naruto! I know! Hishaku, lend me some
of your courage! Gotcha. Prepare yourself, you monster crab! Rasengan! You did it, Naruto. Yeah. Thanks to Hishaku. I guess you realized
your dream before I did. I’ve only known you for
a short while, but you're one hell of a captain,
kind of like the Hokage. Thank you, Naruto. I always felt regret that I wasn't able to fight
with the others back then. But you avenged everyone and the heaviness in
my heart is gone. Aw, come on. I was able to destroy that
monster crab all because of you. And you’re one of our comrades now. Yeah, you’re right! But it’s time to say goodbye, Naruto. H-Hey, what's going on? Hey, where'd you go? Hishaku! No one's blaming you! What a problem.
You’re too honorable! You couldn’t rest in peace,
so we couldn’t either! I'm sorry, everyone. You don't need to apologize. We felt so relieved when
that damn crab got hit directly! – Yeah, yeah!
– Yeah, yeah! All right, how about we liven
things up with the usual? – Right!
– Right! Goodbye, Naruto! – Take care!
– Take care! Right. Hishaku, take care of yourself! No way… A ghost ship! The rudder doesn’t work at all!
This is some storm!

 What’s going to happen if
we drift on this current?

 It seems like we’ll be okay!

 If we remain on this current,
we’ll still be on course.

 All right! We’ll head straight to
the Land of Lightning!

 Wait Naruto,
something’s heading this way!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Battleship Island!"

 It’s an attack!
Wait, what is that?

 Tune in again!

 The rudder isn't working! This is some storm! What's going to happen if we keep getting swept away
by the current?! It seems like it will be okay. If we continue like this,
we'll get back on course! We're gonna head straight
to the Land of Lightning! What was that?! What's happening? Here comes another one! Shells made from paper bombs? That thing's firepower is considerable. Where is it coming from? Is that… a battleship? No. It's an island! Battleship Island

 We're being sucked in towards
that island! Can you change course?! I can't!
The rudder still isn't working! You gotta be kidding me! Naruto! Wood Style! The ship! The cargo, scrap metal, everything…
Scoop it all up! Even the humans! Boss Gataro! I-It's impossible. The ship should've been blown apart! No one returns to the island
unless their net is full! As usual, a painful experience
lies in wait for any boat without a full load. Hey you! How dare you mess with our ship! See, there's treasure, after all. Wha—?! A feisty one like you is sure to
bring a good price at auction. But this is a piece of junk. Hey, that's my headband! Open fire! Corner the brat! Prepare to fire! Coordinates: portside 12 degrees,
angle 26 degrees, distance 500. Fire! Run, keep running! Oh no! W-What is this?! What?! You idiots!
That ship hasn't been destroyed yet! Fire! Fire! Fire away! Don't let them get away!
Switch to depth charges! Never mind, just kill them! Blast them to smithereens! Say… How can the ship dive underwater? It's hastily made, but I used my Wood Style to
cover the ship's body and improvised a ballast tank to take in water to keep us
below the surface. It's a makeshift submarine. Thank goodness we brought
a Sensory-Type along. We've managed to get
out of range of the depth charges. Can't we stay underwater and
make it out of this region? Well… Originally, this was a sailing ship. It has no power to propel
forward underwater. Right now, the current is
merely pulling us along. The water depth decreases
beyond this point. When the mole comes up,
I'll blow it to pieces! We have no choice
but to maintain this depth. So we can't surface again? It's flooding! Plug it up! Stop! Towards twelve o'clock! There's a current of air directly
below on the ocean bottom! We can go through! Everyone, run up to the front! That was a close one. Where are we? It looks like… An underwater cavern? There are more tunnels further in. As for our location,
we must be beneath the island. Stairs. This cavern seems to have
been excavated for human use. Then, there could be a way
to get to the surface. Let's split up and check. Naruto! Where are you going?! I'm going back to get my headband! Hold it! Didn't I tell you? Going back to the surface
right now means certain death. That headband is important to me! You will get it back!
You definitely will. But for now, we'll stay hidden
and wait for our chance. Besides, I think… I used my Wood Style too much. I'll be fine once I rest a bit. Captain Yamato… H-Hot?! It's a hot spring, Captain Yamato! We can easily replenish
our chakra by resting here. You're right. This water feels great! What is this? It seems these people
were the islanders. Islanders? You mean they were
with those pirates? No. It seems they were
the indigenous people of this island. What's going on? Several decades ago those pirates
attacked the island and it's written here that
the native islanders were slaughtered. What? These people got away
by going underground through a tunnel in the mountain
and hiding themselves. Run, run! I want to be entertained
until their boat surfaces! Just grin and bear it! The next boat with the lowest yield,
come on out! The pirates occupy the land above. If these people were discovered,
it meant certain death. That's why… They lived down here
quietly for decades? How sad. What're you doing? I, Naruto Uzumaki, will get justice
for their pain and suffering! Looks like I have no choice
but to see that guy again. So they used this tunnel. It's no good.
The line is frayed and doesn't work. It's a volcanic crater. It's quite a ways to the top. Hey, how come it's so warm? It seems there's a subterranean
hot spring stream. Yeah, there is! Captain Yamato was taking
a soak until a while ago. It's quite large. W-What's the matter, Naruto? Hot springs…floating… Wood… Wood Style… Submarine?! I got it! What is it, Naruto? Just hear me out.
Don't laugh, okay? How about this strategy? No good? No, let's try it. Hey Naruto! I'm okay! All right! Let's sail! Bushy Brow Sensei! You're on! Right! You got it! How was that? I guess it was imposs… Hot! – All right! Float upwards!
– Way to go! Just you wait, you pirates! Boss Gataro! Maybe those guys died
at the bottom of the sea. No sense in waiting any longer. Are you telling me what to do?! That kid's not gonna die that easily. I decided to kill him and
I'm gonna do a thorough job of it. Just like the time I took over this island. W-What just happened?! Damn that brat! One more! Stop firing or it'll explode! Damn that… How's that?! G-Get him! If you let him escape,
you're all dead! Surround him! Catch him like a rat in a mousetrap! I'm not gonna lose! This is retribution for
all the islanders' suffering! Are you kidding?
This island is mine! If you make trouble, I'll kill you all the same way
I killed the others! Wait a minute. Where are your friends? You're the one
who's gonna get pulverized! Why you... Clones, eh? Over here! Over here! What's that?! Hey, you pirates!
Get ready for this! Wood Style! Go! Fly! All right! I have avenged you. Hey Aoba, is this really
the island?

 Well, judging from the direction
it flew off to,

 we can safely say this is
its habitat.

 To think that there was a bird
that could fly off with Guy Sensei.

 We have to look for him quickly!

 Wait! There's someone there!

 I'll go talk to them.
You guys continue the search.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
The Forgotten Island

 Wait! Just who are you?

 Tune in again!

 The Forgotten Island

 We'll be repairing the ship. Thank you. Is Bushy Brow Sensei
really here? The bird flew off
in this direction. I think it's safe to conclude that
its nest is around here. But…is there a chance that
Bushy Brow Sensei has been eaten? No matter how seasick and weak he is,
he wouldn't let a bird eat him. Well, I'll use Sage Mode
and see if I can find him. Hold it, Naruto. We don't know
what kind of island this is. Let's keep our secret weapons
in reserve. Look, over there. There's a native islander!
I'll go talk to her. Are we gonna wait
until he returns? No. Let's search in another direction. Wait! I'm not anyone suspicious! Wait! Rasengan! That's a humongous spider. It's coming. Right! Shadow Clone Jutsu! – It's huge!
– It's huge! Wood Style! I've battled a giant serpent
like this before. Yeah. It's just like
Orochimaru's Summons. That bird! It's the one that took Guy! Stop! Hey you,
can I ask you something? Have you seen my friend? We're looking for our friend
who got separated from us. I'd like to ask you
some questions. And ask about you as well. What is this? "Investigation into Summoning:
Improvements as Well as Creation." Creation? "This is a Summoning Island." "Many life forms reside here that
are useful to shinobi for summoning." "At first, research was
our only purpose." "But to satisfy requests from
shinobi for Summoning Animals," "we set out to capture them." "In the midst of
increasing demand," "it was decided to begin improving
the Summoning Animals." "Through crossbreeding," "new species of Summoning Animals
will also be created." "The demand from shinobi
is increasing." "Is there an Ultimate
Summoning Animal?" "If not, we will just
have to create one." "The problem is how to
suppress the ultimate animal." "To control it, a special
Sealing Jutsu is necessary." "Or perhaps something else
that is unique like a Jinchuriki." "It would be perfect if a survivor
of that village could be found." Jinchuriki? What is this island? Hey! Ready? Let's go. Right! Yes, that's right! Raise your legs higher! – What?
– What? Bushy Brow Sensei? You guys! Hey, stop that, you guys!
I know! I know! What's going on? Well, it seems… Hey! Stop, stop! I've been brought here
to babysit them. Babysit? What? That's ridiculous. I'm not in any danger
of being eaten. I'm just here playing
with these chicks. By the way, where are we? Well, we have no idea either. We came chasing after you,
Bushy Brow Sensei. Say, why did you
bring me here? If you want a babysitter,
find someone else. I'm in the midst of a mission.
I must go. What?
You want me to get on? Yes! All right. Guy! We won't learn anything
by staying here. You two come along! You… This is… Hey, is this the Ultimate
Summoning Animal? Then I'll ask it directly. Whoa, what are they?! Does it plan to land there? Shoo, shoo! Inside here? This is a volcano! A volcano! What the heck is that voice? Wood Style! Let's go and see! Right! We're going?! Hey, stay away! Ignore them. They're not showing signs
that they want to attack us. No way... It was eating them?
The other animals… The Summoning Animals
of this island? It's not working.
We can't control it. Honoka! The seal!
Hurry and seal it! Honoka! Do something
to make it stop! I can't. I can't suppress it. Help… Someone, help me! This thing ate everything in sight,
and then went to sleep. Now it's a chrysalis
waiting to mature. Then that means you're… Aoba! Guy! You're alive. Never mind that.
What is this place? It seems to be a research facility to
create Ultimate Summoning Animals. And the result of the research… What is this? I'm not sure where
these shinobi were from, but they were conducting research
on Summoning Animals. And it seems they've created
the Ultimate Summoning Animal that feeds on other animals and
assimilates their abilities into its own. What? This thing is alive? Probably… Furthermore, it swallowed up
the researchers and is trying to further evolve. Th-Those guys… What's happening?! Is it about to be born? So this is the Ultimate
Summoning Animal? Well, it just looks like
a giant greedy monster to me. What will we do? Anyone want to try
entering into a contract with it? It's in no mood for that! It's coming! Damn! Spider thread? It assimilated the abilities of
that spider it devoured earlier. It's hungry? It's starving. No matter how much it eats,
it still feels hungry. All it knows is a desire
to eat everything in sight. In other words, it's a failure
of a Summoning Animal. However, it was created specifically
for use against shinobi. Don't let your guard down! Wood Style! Right on, Captain Yamato! It sucked out my chakra! So that's what "created specifically
for use against shinobi" means. I'll pulverize it with
my Sage Mode! Naruto's Sage Mode requires time
to absorb Nature Energy. Let's cover him! Eight Inner Gates!
Fifth Gate! Open! I can do this! It's using genjutsu! Hang in there, Guy! That was an
embarrassing defeat! Naruto! It's genjutsu! I can't believe that thing
can use genjutsu! Lightning Style?! It uses ninjutsu too. We don't know what other abilities
it has up its sleeve! Lava! There…by the back entrance! I see. If we can drop that thing
into the lava, it's over. Wood Style: Domed Wall! Naruto, go into Sage Mode! All right, here I go! Severe Leaf Hurricanes! How was that?! Wings?! I won't let you escape! Is it trying to run away?! If we let something
like that loose… What's going on? Are they trying to avenge
the others who were eaten? Watch out! Get back! I knew it, so you really are… Aoba! Why won't you stop her? Because that is just an embodiment
of her thoughts that were left behind. Naruto! Now! Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! Thank you. To think that I could
fall asleep while training!

 It just shows that
I lack vigilance!

 I have to become
strong like Naruto.

 No! I have to become
stronger than Naruto!

 But if I could be strong like
how I was in that dream...

 Guy Sensei! It might time
to undergo that training!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Fight! Rock Lee!"

 Tune in again!

 Master! Master! Master! Master! FOOL Master! Who did this?! Out… Out? Out! Out? I'm telling you to get out! As if I'd let you! You're Madara,
the leader of the Akatsuki! You are right, Rock Lee, ultimate weapon
of the Hidden Leaf! That man was just bait
to lure you here. You are unforgivable! MEDICINE This is the time for
Sensei's secret medicine! MADARA What's with those moves? You look like a drunk.
This will be an easy match. With my Teleportation Ninjutsu,
there's no way you can touch me. Oww! The more I drink, the stronger I get. This is the Drunken Fist! You won't be able to see
my punch coming! What?! What?! Too easy! Oww! I'm just getting started! Sensei, can I have another? That was the last one! Well, you heard that too. So until I get more medicine,
let's take a breather. Okay, fine. No way!
Like I'd agree to that! It was just a dream. Falling asleep during training.
It just shows that I lack vigilance! War is coming! I have to become
much stronger like Naruto. Effort! I must put in more effort! Effort! Huh? But… if I can become strong
without the medicine, like in that dream… Guy Sensei, I think the time has come
to attempt that training again! Fight! Rock Lee!

 Just lie down and stay still. Don't be ridiculous. If I can't overcome something
as minor as seasickness through guts and effort, I don't deserve to be
the Leaf's Blue Beast! All right, all right already! Speaking of which,
during that time… It was the day after
we took Lee out to celebrate, for learning the Hidden Lotus. I feel rotten. I must've had too much
to drink last night. Huh? Why is Lee in my room? The thing is…
I don't remember. Although I remember going
to dinner with you, Sensei, I can’t remember anything
beyond that. Same here. But I have this feeling that
something important happened. I'm sorry, Sensei! W-What did you do, Lee? You took me out to dinner, and I had the audacity
to forget all about it. I have this feeling that
I listened to you give me many hints
on training as well. I am a failure as your student! No wait, Lee. Huh? What was that just now? Wait a minute. That's right. BAR-B-Q U-Umm…I'm sorry! I-I, Might Guy,
am responsible for everything! Sensei? What is the matter, Sensei? Oh no, it's nothing! I think I've gone and done it. Oh, did you perhaps
remember something? What did you remember? No, no. It's nothing important. B-By the way, Lee… Why'd you bring something
like this back? I feel bad about taking it
from the restaurant, MENU

but I used this menu to take
notes on your training hints! Training hints? Yes! Please take a look! Yakitori? And what about it? Sensei, you told me that
one could train at any time. For example, even with this menu.
You circled the yakitori! You said to visualize. Visualize with yakitori?! Hey, now that you mention it… MAKE-OUT PARADISE Kakashi! Kakashi! Time for a match
with my lifelong rival! Let's do it.
We have to! Understand? I can't. I'm training right now. Training?! How can reading such indecent books
be considered training? This is my way of training. I think it's called visualization training. Whether it's a real battle
or training, visualizing it and not visualizing it
makes a huge difference. You should read books too
and learn to visualize. See you! Learn to visualize? What's he talking about?
Developing a new jutsu? That's called visualization training. Visualization training? What kind of training is it? W-Well, it's an important type
of training… I think. That's it, Sensei! Yesterday, you were probably telling me
about this visualization training! If we do that training, maybe we'll remember
something about yesterday! Let's try it, Sensei! If I can train and remember
what happened yesterday, it will be killing two birds
with one stone. Better yet, if you get
your memory back, we’ll get three birds
with one stone! Th-This isn't good. Especially if it makes him
remember yesterday. If he remembers my pitiful appearance, I'll lose face as his master. I am Might Guy,
the Leaf's Blue Beast. I will not let him remember! And I'll do everything in
my power to prevent it! Sensei… W-What kind of training
is this anyway? You don't know, Lee? This is what is known as
visualization training! So this is visualization training? Yes. Yakitori is associated with chicken! When you think of
bird-style self-defense… You think of the White Crane Fist! Oh! I can see it, Master. It is definitely a crane! When becoming one
with the crane, you get closer to mastering
the White Crane Fist! And this is visualization training
for the White Crane Fist! N-Now that you mention it… it's quite difficult to balance
on one leg in the mud. I see! This also combines strength training
for your legs and torso! Lee! You're not visualizing enough! Visualize! This is more than just a skewer
of yakitori chicken. Visualize a sword plunging
through great lands and call it
the "Yakitori" technique! I see! Visualize yakitori! This is deep stuff! Yakitori! I will become a yakitori! Yes! Yakitori! Visualize yakitori! For some reason,
Sensei, the birds seem quite upset. I think you're right. Oh boy… Having yakitori in front of
the birds wasn’t such a good idea. But there won't be
any problems this time! Kabayaki eel? Is there such
a self-defense technique? You're not visualizing hard enough. The movements of an eel
mirror those of a snake. And when we speak of snake… We have the Snake Fist! Oh, the Snake Fist?! Lee, continue! Yes, sir! Visualize a snake slithering silently
on the ground hunting its prey! Sensei, look. What is this?! Well, this is, you know, the stuff they call quicksand! Th-That was a close call. Just the opposite. Because I was in that situation,
we were able to overcome it. Right. But Sensei,
where are we headed now? Next on the menu is mabo tofu. Right, but… Mabo tofu contains
hawk claw chili pepper. And when one talks
about hawk claws… It brings to mind Eagle Claw Fist! Then… Nothing ventured, nothing gained. To visualize an eagle,
go to an eagle's nest! Jump! Oh sorry, sorry! We are friends. Friends! You're late, Lee! Sensei, will I find the essential point
of the Eagle Claw Fist here? – We meant no harm!
– I’m sorry! Sensei, have you been able
to remember anything? N-No. What about you? Not really. I-I see. All right! I think I'll be able
to fool him somehow with this visualization
training nonsense. I feel rejuvenated! Huh? What's this?
I think I remember something. I-I'm sure Lee has seen me
at my worst. I must prevent him
from recalling anything about how I was yesterday! Sensei, there's one more
menu item that's been circled. I-I see. So that's the last one? If we still can't remember after this,
it can't be helped! So? What is it? MENU

I know this one too. After all, the thing that
is circled is sake. I'm visualizing
a defense technique like Drun… It's the Drifter Fist! The Drifter Fist! The sea! Is there such a technique? Yes, there is! That was close. I have to avoid bringing up
any images of sake. Drunken Fist is out of the question. Sensei, let's start training now! Lee, what are you doing? Yes! Since it's called the Drifter Fist,
I figured we would train on a boat. Oh, right!
You are becoming very sharp. The visualization training is paying off. Oh boy… A boat, huh? Let's begin, Sensei. This training involves
more than visualization. There's no sense in even beginning unless you can maintain balance
on a swaying boat. Yes, Guy Sensei! If this is the extent of the swaying,
it's quite easy. S-Stop! Stop! To remain still on the water's surface! That is the essence
of the Drifter Fist. Don't rock the boat so much! B-But I'm not rocking the boat. Th-This training is definitely intense! S-Sensei, I'm not feeling too well. Oh no! Those moves look just
like the Drunken Fist. I must stop him! Lee, you can't master
the Drifter Fist with such moves. Stand firm! L-Like this? I-I am standing firm. H-Hey! What kind of movement is that? Yes, but if I'm to keep my balance… I naturally take… This boy… The Drunken Fist
comes naturally to him. That's right! What's the big idea, you jerk! So fast! And such nice movement. But why? Pickles made with sake lees? Sake lees, as in the by-product
of sake making. So that's it! No wonder you’re the boy wonder
of the Drunken Fist technique, Lee! Go for it! Teach him a lesson! No mercy for a drunkard
who tries to eat and run! Hit to your heart's content! So that's it. You were the one. Guy Sensei, I'm sorry. What are you apologizing for, Lee? Did I do something terrible yesterday? Maybe you tried to defend me
and were forced to bow your knees to apologize
for my shameful deed? You remember that? I don't remember what took place. But when I came to,
the shop was in tatters. And you were apologizing. When you saw that,
didn't you find me clumsy and uncouth? No such thing! Your words at that time… This day commemorates
my pupil's hard work and effort. I admit, he's a foolish student
who only knows how to work hard. But he endeavors in
a way no ordinary man can and he will continue to persevere because he is a genius
at working hard! He will become a fine shinobi who will guide
the Hidden Leaf into the future. He is the treasure to
whom I have dedicated my life! If anyone is to take responsibility,
it will be me, his teacher! So… You asked them not to
spoil this day for me, which stands for my past endeavors
as well as my future efforts. That's all I can remember.
That's all, but… But I felt the passion in your words! That's why I was trying so hard
to get you to remember yesterday. Because I wanted you to
scold me for messing up. But this is the last training hint. The final one that might unlock
the memories I seek. What am I to do? Lift your head up, Lee! Sensei? Lee, you've done nothing wrong! All you did was try to learn
the Drunken Fist! Sensei, you regained
your memory of yesterday? Never mind that. Now I am going to pass on to you
the art of the Drunken Fist! B-But don't you need sake
for the Drunken Fist? The drunker you get,
the stronger you become. That is the essence
of the Drunken Fist. But you already have
an innate affinity for the Drunken Fist! Get sick! Feel the nausea! Through seasickness,
perfect your own unique Drunken Fist! This is for real?! After this, you’ll have to put
this training into actual use! Let's go! Right! Too easy, Lee! Severe Leaf Hurricanes! All right then! Leaf Whirlwind! This nausea is getting worse
by the second! But your Seasick Fist is
looking better and better! Yes! This is my own version
of the Drunken Fist. The Seasick Fist. Yes! It’s the Seasick Fist! Here I come! He disappeared?! I feel really sick! Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei! Are you all right, Sensei?! You got me good. You did it! The Seasick Fist. That single hit was awesome. Sensei… Th-Thank you very… Yes. And after undergoing intense training
through seasickness, Lee perfected his Seasick Fist! He can't use it though. Well, certainly unless
he overcomes seasickness, he cannot use it in real battle. So Lee… I swear that through hard work
and sheer guts, I will conquer seasickness and
master the true Seasick Fist! That's not what I meant. As it is now, he gets seasick
so he can't use it. But if he gets over being seasick, he won't get that drunken feeling and won't be able to
produce the Drunken Fist. What the heck?! What’s this?!

 Our food has been infested
with these mushrooms!

 It’s not just the food,
but our water is gone too.

 Then we just have to turn
the ship around

 and go back to the harbor!

 We can’t. Once we’re on this course,
turning back is impossible.

 But that’s…

 We still have two weeks until
we can get off this course.

 We are just going to have to endure
without eating or drinking!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Eat or Die! Mushrooms from Hell!"

 Something to eat.
Give me something to eat!

 Tune in again!

 It's been so long since
we've stood on dry land! We're here! Did we finally make it
to the new continent? New continent? Are you saying we've arrived
at the Land of Lightning? No, we're just making
a stop at this fishing port to stock up on supplies. Our ocean voyage has just begun. So this means I have to endure
more time on the high sea and try to come out of it alive?! After we leave this port, we won't be able to dock
for quite some time. Is that so? For about two weeks, since we'll be entering
the Sea Route of Silence. The Sea Route of Silence? Yes. The Sea Route of Silence is
an unusual area in the vast ocean. In it,
there's no wind or fish. It is surrounded by
a mysterious magnetic field. Even steamships can't function there. Then how will the boat
move forward? There's just one strip,
as narrow as a canal, where a small current flows. We'll have the boat ride
that current. Once we're on that current, we won't
be able to speed up or turn around. So it will be like riding along leisurely on
the back of a horse you can't control. That's true. But there are merits to it as well. Every ship that enters this route
will face the same situation. So we won't have to worry about
being attacked by pirates or an enemy. I see. In any case, we need to stock up
on two weeks of supplies. We can't afford to run out
while we're on this course. So please gather food. Naruto, can I ask you get
Guy Sensei's share too? Why are you all spinning around? Man, do I have to? Okay! That's everything. Now, I just need to get back to
the ship and we can set sail! What's the matter? Hey! Are you okay? I'm sorry about that. I'm all right. You're a Hidden Leaf ninja,
aren't you? Huh? Well…yeah. Is it true that the Five Great Nations
have formed an alliance and are going to start a war? Are those rumors going around? Yes. Small lands like ours have
no choice but to abide by their orders. But seeing that you've stopped at
this fishing port and purchased provisions, I suppose you're going through
the Sea Route of Silence to get to the Land of Lightning,
am I correct? Yeah, that's about right. I can't tell you much more than that. I wish I could buy vegetables
from you to make amends, but I've already gotten
everything we need. Then… How about getting one of these? What is it? It's a mushroom known
as a Moldshroom. Moldshroom? They're really delicious! And they're very easy to propagate,
so in case of emergencies, you can grow them and eat them, and you won't have to worry
about food shortages. Seafarers who set out on
the Sea Route of Silence always buy one to keep
as a last resort. That's a beneficial mushroom to have! All right! I'll buy one! See you. Thank you! Eat or Die! Mushrooms from Hell!

 I don't want to go!
I'm not getting back on board! This is the Hidden Cloud Village! You guys are wrong! Please, Guy!
You're not a spoiled brat. – You're hopeless!
– Don't wanna! Guy! Hey Naruto,
why on earth did you just… I don't have the patience
to put up with Bushy Brow Sensei's
"cute spoiled brat" act. That's for sure, but… Let's set sail. Guy, let's get going. – Here you go.
– Got it! Have a safe trip! It looks like we've entered
the Sea Route of Silence. We can't see anything around us. And this intense humidity… Just thinking about sailing through this
for two weeks makes me depressed. However, this is the safest place
on the ocean. Naruto, you should use this time to rest. I know. What's the matter, Captain Yamato? No, it's nothing. Yamato! Yamato! Get a hold of yourself! He suddenly collapsed in pain. All we can do at this point
is have him rest. Did something happen? Bushy Brow Sensei! What happened to
your seasickness? The swaying subsided once
we entered the Sea Route of Silence, and so did my seasickness. I see. Just when you start feeling better,
it's Captain Yamato's turn. What happened to Yamato? We don't know for certain. It seems something is
eroding Yamato's chakra. Yamato's chakra? We still don't know
what's causing his symptoms. So does that mean… Bad news! What is it?! Please come with me! What are these?! Mushrooms?! Did some spores get mixed in
with our provisions? I bought a mushroom
called a Moldshroom. But only one. And it didn't have
a poisonous-looking color like these. The ship's entire food supply
is right here. Does that mean all of
our food supply is destroyed? Does this mean the only thing
we can eat are these mushrooms? Check out their coloring. They look like
poisonous mushrooms to me. It's not just the food. Our water is gone too. No way! We can't go on
without food or water. We have to turn
this ship around… We can't. Once we're on
the Sea Route of Silence, turning back is impossible. But we just got on the route! So we have two weeks until
we can get off of this course? It means we are just
going to have to endure without eating or drinking! Are you kidding me?! Still… There's gotta be at least one fish. Or at least one bird. There's nothing! Once before, during the peak
of my passionate days of youth, I trained by fasting. A human burns
1600 calories each day. Without nutrients,
the human body converts its own muscle into protein
and turns fat into energy. As long as this continues,
you will not starve to death. Starve to death… I hope not. But that's as long as
you stay sufficiently hydrated. Right now, we're in
the opposite situation. At this rate, even the most determined adult
will die in one to two weeks. What day is this?! I don't know.
A week might have passed already. I've been hungry so long,
my stomach can't tell the time anymore. If this goes on, we're definitely
going to starve to death. Perhaps it's time for our last gamble. Our last gamble? Follow me, Naruto. No way. This is your last gamble? Yes, this is it! If these are edible… They sure look poisonous to me. But these mushrooms could
be absolutely delicious. And if we don't eat anything,
we will die. I know, but… Naruto, let's do
rock-paper-scissors right now. All right! I'm ready for this! Here we go, Naruto! - Ready, set, go!
- Ready, set, go! - Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors! All right! I win! I win! I should've known
you'd go with paper! That doesn't sound too flattering. Sensei, now's the time to be a man
and step up. Bushy Brow Sensei? W-What's going on?
Have you lost it? No, Naruto.
I'm relishing this moment. Huh? I've been waiting for this moment! Thank you for the food! Bushy Brow Sensei,
are you okay? So the mushrooms were
poisonous, after all! These are delicious.
I've never eaten anything so good! How could I not have
eaten them until now?! Bushy Brow Sensei,
are you sure they taste good? I'm going to eat them!
I'll eat them all up! Wait! Hey wait!
Me too! I'm gonna eat too! Hey, you're right!
They taste great! I can't stop! I'm starting to feel really good! Me too. I feel energy rising from
deep inside my body. There are some more
mushrooms over there. Those mushrooms are all mine! Take this!
Mushroom Hurricane! I know what your weakness is,
Bushy Brow Sensei! Ninja Art! Mushroom Harem Jutsu! Bushy Brow Sensei… So handsome! Let's have some fun! So naïve! You think something like that will
make me get a nosebleed?! Great Mushroom Hurricane! You're mine!
Mushroom Rasengan! Too easy, Naruto! Not bad!
Shadow Clones, huh? The real one's over here! Mushroom Rasengan! Severe Mushroom Hurricane! How did this happen? I should have never
bought that mushroom. Damn it! Who cares now.
I need to put food in my mouth. In my mouth. That's it! Ninja Art:
Mushroom Summoning Jutsu! Hey Naruto, what do you want? What's this? You look so yummy!
I'm gonna eat you! It looks like they're all dead. They intended to go to
the Land of Lightning. They must have some kind
of treasure on board. I admire your cleverness, Boss! Yeah, he's a pirate that operates
with a single mushroom. The Moldshroom is just
an ordinary mushroom. But if you keep it in a dark,
humid place for more than a day, it turns into a very toxic mushroom
that propagates rapidly. It wreaks havoc on
the Sea Route of Silence. And they probably had
no clue what hit them. All right, guys!
Go and find the treasure! – Right!
– Right! So it was all your doing. Hey, how come you guys are… You guys were supposed
to have starved to death! I almost gave in. I was so hungry that I was about
to eat everything in sight. Wait, wait, wait, Gamatatsu! Eat up! Naruto, it tastes good. Eat. Stupid! I'm gonna eat you and you're… I know! I have a good idea! At this point, I'll endure anything. I asked Gamatatsu to bring back
some of Granny Shima's cooking! So you had a trick up your sleeve?! Thanks to her, we ate enough
bug cuisine to last a lifetime. Just thinking about how that tasted… We're gonna give it back to you… real good! The waves are back to normal! But look at this mess. What happened here?
Do you know Naruto? My memory's been fuzzy
ever since I ate those mushrooms. But, this is a real mess. It looks like pirates raided us. Yeah, this is awful.
Yamato's going to be very upset. Maybe something awful happened
before we realized it. I suddenly feel seasick. Not again, Bushy Brow Sensei. Are you awake, Yamato?! What happened to me? You became host to
a kind of parasitic fungus that sucked out
your Wood Style Chakra. You'll be all right now. I can't believe there's a mushroom
that can cause so much suffering. Just goes to show you
how vast this world is. What are you going to do with us? Apparently, the Sea Route of Silence
has a way back. You're not planning to send us there? Exactly. The route takes two weeks to clear! What about food during that time?! You don't have to worry about that. This is… You guys can fill your bellies
with that mushroom! See ya! Wood Style! H-Hey wait! S-Stop! Please stop this! Help us! A mushroom hot pot?! It can't be helped.
All of our provisions are gone. Until we reach the nearest port,
all we have are… Mushrooms or bugs! C'mon… Give me a break from
both of those things! – These mushrooms are quite good!
– Naruto, this one is better, try it. – Hurry and just eat!
– No way! I just want something normal to eat! What are they doing?

 Seems like Naruto and his clones
are fighting.

 That's good!

 Men fighting, colliding as
their hot blood circulates!

 I like this!

 Doesn't seem like
that's the case here.

 We're taking control of this ship.

 If you value the life of
the real Naruto,

 you will unconditionally fulfill
all of our demands!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Revenge of the Shadow Clones"

 It's one hassle after another.

 Tune in again!

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,900
This is getting messy...
I better hurry up and use this thing. As I thought, that puppet...
uses the Third Kazekage's Jutsu...! You haven't seen this in
a while, have you...? This Jutsu is why the Third Kazekage
was praised as the most powerful. I'm gonna turn you guys into mush. What the heck is that? That was the most feared weapon
of the Hidden Sand. The Iron Sand. Iron Sand...? The Third developed that Jutsu by basing it on the Jutsu used
by the former Shukaku wielder. It changes the Iron Sand
into various shapes, creating weapons according
to the situation. The Third Kazekage had a special body that could change the Chakra
into magnetism. Similarly, it appears that puppet also can change the Chakra
into magnetism. What do you mean? Even though the actual body of
The Third Kazekage was used, it's still just a doll, right? Why does a doll have the Chakra? No... A Human Puppet made
from an actual living body is fundamentally different
from these normal ones like the "mother" and
"father" puppets. A Human Puppet can only
be made by Sasori... and that is made while
the living Chakra still is embodied. And by doing so, it can use the person's
Jutsu from its previous life. That's the biggest benefit
of the "Human Puppet." That's not all. After all,
this <i>is</i>  my favorite collection. Sakura, get out of here. I will take care of the rest. This is way too unexpected. That Puppet makes it impossible for you. But! You're too slow! <i>Iron Sand: Scattered Showers!</i> <i>Oh shoot!</i> Did you alter it a little?
A Chakra shield, huh? Looks like it's been upgraded compared to the time
I was playing with them. <i>As expected, due to
<i>the Iron Sand, my moves...</i> Don't you know that you have to dodge
this Jutsu and not shield it? Seems like you could barely
let the chick go. I inserted the Iron Sand
into his entire body. As long as I have the Third's magnetism,
that one's done for. Let's see... I will aim at both
of you and attack at once. In order to ensure an definite kill,
I will form it into a lethal weapon. I won't let you get away
a second time... With only one puppet,
you can't guard the both of you. What are you going to do, Granny? Who is gonna die?! <i>Father and Mother


</i> Though only the arm...
Turning your own body into a puppet... As fellow Puppet Masters,
it seems...we think the same way. <i>What's going on?</i> <i>He's the same as before...
<i>He hasn't aged.</i> I see. I get it now... It's the end if the Iron Sand gets in. Let's see...
The puppet has ceased. What are you going to do,
Granny Chiyo? I-Impossible... Damn you... White Fang of the Leaf...! Sasori... Granny Chiyo, please buy me
snacks on the way back. Yeah... why not... Granny Chiyo. How is it, Sasori...? This is the Puppet Master Jutsu
passed down from generation to generation. Don't you want to learn it? Huh?! Can you teach me? Now...come with me. Lined up here are the prototype and incomplete puppets made
in the Hidden Sand Village. Sasori... You can use everything here,
why don't you make your own puppet? My own puppet? <i>Th-This is...!</i> The world's best Puppet Master
is just a human without the puppets, huh. How could I let this...? Now then, what should
I do with this situation? Sakura... In any case, you need to go! Sakura? What's wrong?
Hurry up! I told you...
that it is impossible for you. I will take care of this...
So run! Run? <i>Leaving Granny Chiyo...
<i>and me alone...?</i> <i>No, there should be something...</i> <i>There should be something
<i>even I can do.</i> <i>What I can do now...?</i> <i>That is...</i> Granny Chiyo... Please use me! <i>What I can do now...</i> <i>is to become Granny Chiyo's
<i>puppet and fight.</i> If you use me, he can't stop
my moves with the Iron Sand. I am left with one arm. I can't support you like before. I'm okay... True, I don't have a great weapon
like the puppet, but... Like my master, I have guts! <i>Princess Tsunade, huh...</i> The Third's power is magnetism. Therefore, weapons made from
iron and steel won't work. Excellent! I am also like my master
when it comes to fighting with the fist. That again... Ridiculous. Here I go! You... Here I come! Naruto Shippuden is
becoming more exciting. In the next episode,
my beloved Sakura is in big trouble. Plus, Sasori... Sorry to interrupt,
but there is breaking news. There was a local earthquake
centered on the river country. A cave has collapsed in some areas. Aftershocks are still continuing
so please be cautious. Ah, Oh no, due to that news,
our preview comment got-- Next time: "The Third Kazekage"

What? Then let's try this
one more time... Ship’s log, supplemental entry. This is the fifth consecutive day
of the storm. Every man on deck is
working hard to keep the ship from capsizing. And I had friends
I could count on. Go, clones! Here you go! Here! Here! This is the last of it! It's over! Good work! I'll release the jutsu now. We can finally rest! Naruto! We're about to lose
the mast to the wind! Can you go and support
the rope with your clones? Got it! We'll get on it right away! – What?!
– What?! You're going to make us
work some more?! Right now, we need every hand
that's available. So come on, get to work! Do your best, me! Even if we're clones,
this is too much! That looks dangerous. Someone go up there
and check it out. Hey, you go. I'm tired. We're all tired! The fatigue I feel is different
from what you clones feel. I've never heard that before. My burden as the leader
is heavier. Who made you our leader? What did you say?! It's not fair. You kept us up on numerous
all-night watches and when the storm finally passes, you refuse to release
the Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu? What’s up with that? If there's another storm,
we’ll need your help again. Hey wait… Hey you… That's enough! Just who do you
think we are anyway? Clones of me! You just have to do
exactly as I say! W-What?! Forget him! Don't bother with someone
like that. He doesn't even have
the trust of his own clones. Well, I’m not foolish enough to
take you clones seriously. Damn it.
Who the hell do you think you are? Listen. You owe everything
to your clones. Remember, you learned
your Wind Style thanks to us. You've got to be kidding!
That power is my very own! What?! You guys… It kind of seems like you guys
changed a bit from a while ago. It just goes to show that you haven't had a one-on-one
relationship with your clones. In other words, we're your clones. But you have this bias,
this prejudice towards us. It's not bias. It's just hard to accept that
some of you guys are inside me. Oh dear.
Are you criticizing yourself? There’s no way a softie
like you or a gloomy one like you
are a part of me! I guess you don't recognize
yourself in your clones. If you didn’t have
this personality inside you, you wouldn’t need a jutsu
like the Sexy Jutsu. To be honest, that jutsu
is really embarrassing. But I was lonely and wanted someone to pay
attention to me. Don't cry! It's all in the past. Now, everyone in the village
makes such a fuss over us. Be happy! Be happy! Cut it out! You guys are irritating me! Fine! If that's what you want,
I'll release the jutsu. Stop joking. You'll probably work us
to the bone anyway. Like it or not, we're staying! You need to cool your head
and repent! Release! Bang! We're fading. How come you guys
aren’t disappearing? Release! Release! Release! Release! Release! Release! Release!
Release! Release! Release! Release! It's not working. Didn't you know? Summoning and releasing
clones all depend on the willingness of
the clones themselves. Y-You guys… Capture him! Yikes! Stop! Hey! Let go of me! We're not gonna let you hit us
and extinguish us! Tie him up! – Right!
– Right! – What are you doing, Naruto?
– Oww! That hurts! Come on guys!
Get away from me! Hey, this is great! Passionate, hot-blooded men
fighting, colliding, releasing pent-up energy! That doesn’t seem like
that’s the case here. Help, Captain Yamato! We, the Naruto Gang,
are taking control of this ship! He's our hostage! If you want Naruto to live, you must agree to our demands
unconditionally! W-What's going on?! Hey everyone, I can see
the silhouette of an island at one o'clock. Let's see. This fits perfectly into our plans. All right! Sail to that island! What'll we do? I can't believe the clones would
actually take Naruto's life! Still, I could use
some rest on dry land. Straight ahead! – Straight ahead.
– Straight ahead. Revenge of the Shadow Clones

 MEET OUR DEMANDS


 MEET OUR DEMANDS

We clones seek improvements
in our work environment! We demand compensation
and security for the risks we take! And until these
demands are met, we, the clone workforce,
will go on strike! Oh, don't forget about
improving our meals. We want ramen too, you idiot! Miso-flavored pork stock
with roast pork! Now you're talking, Real Naruto! Until we get
a satisfactory settlement, you guys can wait on that island! What a disturbing turn of events. If the strike drags on and our schedule gets
pushed back any further, the Lady Hokage will have our hides. Yeah, I want lots of meat in there! And you two, eat up! You can't wage war on
an empty stomach. Don't bother listening to
these guys' demands! Just hurry up and beat 'em! No one's listening.
They're eating curry. Do you think Captain Yamato
and the rest will come to rescue you? Of course! And in the face of
a jonin's superior ninjutsu, simple-minded clones like you
will be easily destroyed! I wonder what kind
of tactic he'll use? Did someone just dive in? That's… W-Why is he swimming? He's a shinobi. Why doesn't he run across
the surface of the water? Interesting! Guy Sensei is also a jonin. They have something up
their sleeves. Hey, Naruto my boy! You'd better watch out. Something might appear
from a blind spot. Don't you get it? What this naked body
of mine is telling you? I have neither weapons
nor tricks up my sleeve! He seriously came here
without a strategy? I hope you're gonna agree
to our demands? That's so pretentious! The sound of flesh hitting flesh. Feeling it resonate through your bones
and hearing it deep in your inner ear. That's the best way to
understand one another! So come at me and let me
feel your thoughts! Why'd they have to send
a guy like this? Come on! Way to go, Bushy Brow Sensei!
Hurry and untie me! Again! Huh?! If even one blow hits us,
we'll be extinguished! Damn it! Hold it! There! There! There! There! – Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
– Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Looking good. That's the way. This time, I'm serious! Take this! That was dangerous! I thought I was going to die! So you're safe. Returning to the ship was smart. I can't fight seriously on
board a ship either. Did you think we were
simply running away? If we could induce Guy Sensei
to unleash a big attack at sea, and somehow we counter it
and get back to the ship… Naturally, Guy Sensei would follow us. And just about then, the waves from the after-shock
of your attack would… This swaying…
Make it stop! My inner ear! Just when I ate my curry. After going on that rampage, the end result is that he put us
at a disadvantage. Does he even know the purpose
of our strategy? Maybe he just wanted to release
some pent-up stress of being at sea. Oh, he’s been caught. Looks like I've been caught. All you did was give them
another hostage. Okay, Guy Sensei,
tell us Captain Yamato’s strategy. Well, I rushed in on impulse. So I know nothing regarding the details
of the strategy. Then why did you come here?! Wow! That's amazing! That's a huge fish! Should we salt and grill it? Fried would be good too. Here. Stewed would be good too. Hey! Keep guarding that side! I am! What the heck is this?! I can't see! Oh, Ninja Art, Animal Suit Jutsu…
Get it? Couldn't you come up with
a more serious strategy?! Capture them! Captain Yamato! Untie the rope while
we have the chance! Damn! Those gulls were just
a diversion to allow Captain Yamato to get on board
and activate his jutsu. Free at last! But it still doesn’t feel like we are. Because stupid, as it is now,
we're all hostages. How dare you call
the real me "stupid"?! You clones are the stupid ones, stupid! Stupidity is probably all
that's left inside you. W-What did you say? Hold on, Naruto. Why don't just give in
to their demands? W-What're you saying,
Bushy Brow Sensei? I can understand where
they're coming from. Until now, they've worked tirelessly
without complaint. Isn't it only fair to listen
to what they want? Right? Yeah, we're just asking for
a little understanding here. Our demands aren't important if… Stop messing around. Why should I listen to any
of their demands?! I'm the real Naruto! I'm like their parent! And kids are supposed to
obey their parents! When did you decide that? Fine! Then we demand the same rights
as the real Naruto! We demand equal turns
to be the leader! Clones are clones! There's no way
you can be the real me! You're just copies!
So don't get cocky! Naruto! That's uncalled for! Whose side are you on,
Bushy Brow Sensei?! I am on your side, Naruto! Take a good look once more
at them, at yourself! I'm not a wimp,
and I'm not conceited like that! I don’t go around grinning
all the time and I'm totally not like that! Naruto! Captain Yamato, I'm sorry. After you planned
a strategy just to save me. But I've got to do this my own way! Is he still relying on clones? Well, he can't use Rasengan
without clones. Keep talking, you four! If I summon a hundred more,
it'll be over in a jiffy for you. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here we go, clones! There's no guarantee that
you're going to be you forever. There's nothing strange in
being taken over at any time. This is the chance
we've been waiting for. That's why we listened to
all your ridiculous requests. From now, we are you. S-Stupid! If I die, then so do you! That's if you are indeed
the real Naruto. Let's test it out
and see who is the real Naruto. Hey, there’s no reason
to get so surprised. What? Where are the weapons? Weren't you guys on strike and
going to steal my identity? What kind of nonsense is that? And I'm sure there were four clones. So earlier, the pulley from
the mast came falling and one of your clones shielded you
with his body and disappeared. He protected me? Don't you remember? You… Me… The real Naruto. We demand the same rights
as the real Naruto! So that was a clone's dream. And when the clone was released,
the details were left inside me and got mixed up with reality. Hey! Are you finally going
to release the jutsu?! Yeah, good work. Release! Whe war will begin soon.

 Lady Tsunade, I know
you’re planning to send me

 to the frontlines as a commander.

 A slight error in judgment could
result in my friends dying.

 Do I really have
the power right now

 to command everyone and
hold their lives in my hands?

 Of course, I’m indecisive.

 Next on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Closed Route"

 Go. There’s a mission
that’s just right for you.

 Tune in again!

 This will be a war unlike
any other we've had. Shikamaru, I need you in charge
of the front lines. Yes, ma'am. I'm counting on your sharp intellect. Shikamaru, it's your turn. Your mind seems somewhere else.
Are you scared? It's not that I'm scared. If I make one bad decision,
my comrades will die. So what do I do?
What will I be able to do? I have doubts. You are stuck in Repetition too. Repetition… When each player has the same pieces
positioned on the shogi board, and the same pieces in hand, four repeated moves will
force a draw. Don't lose sight of your goal.
Go see Naruto. There is a supply mission. It will be a nice diversion for you. You should go.
I will recommend you. The Closed Route

 It's so quiet here. Yeah. The large coral reefs
around Mokuzu Island function as a natural breakwater. So the waves are very gentle
and make it an ideal harbor. Yes, this sea is like a mirror. Having said that… MOKUZU RAMEN We shouldn't linger here too long. Hard-a-port! Damn it! Tasting local delicacies
is part of the fun of traveling! The sun's gonna set real soon! Why do we have to set sail
without even docking? He may be the village hero,
but he's still the same old Naruto. How can you be so carefree
at a time like this? Did you say something? Forget it. It doesn't concern you. In any case, why were you guys
waiting at Mokuzu Island? Replenishing supplies. Supplies? So where are they? Here! H-Help. What are you, a walking supply store? Are you all right? Don't just stand there watching.
Help me. I didn't find the answer by
seeing Naruto either, Dad. The fog has gotten thick.
Be careful. Don't worry.
We have a compass. Huh? That's strange. What's wrong? Do I really have the power right now
to command everyone and hold their lives in my hands? What should I do? What's the matter, Shikamaru? Oh…it's nothing. By the way, where's Guy Sensei? I don't see him. Well, he's been seasick
from the time we set out. Even now, he's lying down
in his quarters. Good morning, everyone! Guy Sensei, you look fine. Shikamaru, you're here! The ship's moving.
Are you all right? Yes, I don't feel seasick at all today. What a great way to wake up. The fog is so dense,
I can't see a thing. Did you just notice that? Seasickness has made you dense— Watch out! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! That was a close call. I'm sorry about that. Hey, there are rocks all
around the ship! There shouldn't be any
reef systems around here. Hold the rudder steady. It's useless.
I can't avoid the rocks! You can leave it to me, Might Guy…
The Leaf's Burning Youth! Chesto! I'm not done yet! He's going wild. But that's so like Guy Sensei. Bushy Brow Sensei,
behind you! Behind you! Huh?! A rock this size is nothing! Damn it.
Isn't there something we can do? Yamato! I know! Wood Style! Are you all right,
Captain Yamato?! Yeah. Look at that! It's a huge whirlpool! What?! This ship doesn't have a chance
if it's pulled into that thing! This isn't good.
The rudder's not working! What are we gonna do?! Naruto, use Massive Rasengan! What? Massive Rasengan? Never mind! Just hurl one in there! O-Okay! Captain Yamato, make sure
you pull me back. You got it. Now! They're a tough bunch. Are we okay now? What the—?! Not again? Damn it! I'll keep pulverizing
every single one of them! Chesto! What?! Naruto! Right! What is this?
What is going on? This is too weird to be
a natural phenomenon. Our mission is to make sure Naruto
gets to the Land of Lightning safely. If this is a trick in order
to abduct Naruto, we have to identify the enemy. What?! This is the third time. Is the enemy trying to make
Naruto and the others use up their chakra? But even now, I sense
no presence of the enemy. Could this be a genjutsu? No, that's the real thing. Or, it could be
the Transportation Technique. Nope. A shinobi capable of laying down
a massive spatial barrier like this wouldn't need to bother forcing us
to use up our chakra. I'm all out of chakra. What?! This is the fourth time. Just like the Repetition move. Guy Sensei… It's hopeless!
We've all run out of steam! I figured as much. This is a drag, but… I'm not only one left! Controlling a vessel
as heavy as a sailing ship won't be easy with my jutsu, but… I have no choice! Shikamaru, I don't expect
anything like that from you. What? Leave the physical work to me! Your job is to use your head
to figure a way out of this! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Damn it. Why was I so impatient? Naruto is absolutely right. Okay, let's review everything
in order. What happened after
we left the port? As soon as we pulled out of port,
we were surrounded by fog. We were on the ocean,
but Guy Sensei didn't get seasick at all. and the compass became unreliable. Shortly afterwards,
we sailed into a reef system that  was not marked on the sea chart
and a whirlpool appeared. A whirlpool is caused by complex terrain on the ocean bottom
and shifts in sea level. Damn it!
Today is a spring tide day! On top of that, there's only
a narrow entryway to the bay. A large amount of water flowing in
with the spring tide will easily form a whirlpool. Guy Sensei didn't get
seasick because… It's such a quiet place. the calm waves of that huge bay
held the ship steady. No doubt about it. There's a huge rock! Everyone, hold steady! What's that?! When did that mark appear? So that means it's from the ship
rubbing against that over and over? Which means… We've been going around
this bay in circles! Rasengan! I've run out of chakra. There's another huge whirlpool. Another one?! Enough, Naruto. I have an idea. What are you thinking about? We'll just sail straight for it
and get swallowed up. What?! What on earth are you
up to, Shikamaru?! Tenten, I need to borrow your power. Huh? That's what happens
when you get caught in the Devil's Water Trap
of Mokuzu Island! They're dead at last! Their ship has been swallowed up
by the giant whirlpool and sent to the bottom of the sea! All right! Operation over! – Yay!
– Hurrah! We have a huge catch today! Let's go get our shinobi treasure! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Hey! There's no debris from
the ship floating around! What? Maybe the treasure was so heavy,
that everything sank. So every one of you on
Mozuku Island is a thief? Who the hell are you?! If you want our treasure so much,
try and take it away. Don't be scared! They should be completely exhausted
from dodging the traps! Don't underestimate shinobi. – Tenten!
– Right! For a trap set by amateurs,
it was pretty clever. Damn it! I'm seasick again! Shikamaru! Your sharp intellect
is pretty reliable, after all. I'm glad I met you. Huh? What? Nothing. Just forget it. What, what? Tell me. What is it? Shut up, will you?
You're such a pest! What? A pest?!
What do you mean by that? Don't just sigh! Tell me! So Barbe-Q's reopening?

 Don't worry! I've already
made reservations!

 Beef tongue with salt,
here I come!

 They have a special ladies combo
on the new menu!

 It's a good deal!
I just can't resist good deals!

 Frankly, I just love offal!

 Hey everyone, did you decide
on your drinks?

 Excuse me!
We're ready to order!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Girls' Get-Together"

 I'm going to eat my fill today!

 Tune in again!

 It's boring when everything
goes well on a trip. Captain Yamato! Do you have
anything for me to do? How about you, Aoba? I wonder how everyone
is doing back at the Leaf. I wonder if someone
will come by again. 'Morning.
You're starting early. Good morning. With war looming,
we have to hone our skills. Yes. They say the war will
be centered on Naruto, but it's kind of hard
to imagine why. I wonder how he's doing. He's probably eating some kind
of local ramen special. He didn't seem too concerned. Lady Hinata! It's almost time. What? There's a clan meeting today. We, the Hyuga Clan, will play
an important role here in Hidden Leaf Village. We will probably be assigned
to Sensory-Type duties for the impending
Fourth Great Ninja War. Assignments will be varied,
but in a dire situation we will need one person to
unify and lead the entire clan. However, I have been assigned
to the rear guard. And Hanabi is still too young
for real combat. Neji, I want you to command
our clan on the frontlines. Neji? From the Side Branch? But there's Lady Hinata
from the Main Branch. Everyone in the clan is
well aware of Neji's abilities. We're counting on you, Neji. The Girls' Get-Together

 Please reconsider! Lord Hiashi, you know how hard
Lady Hinata has trained these past few years. She showed her bravery when
she stood up to Pain all by herself. A request for me? What is it? Please help me train
in the Gentle Fist. But Lady Hinata,
you are the Main Branch's… Hanabi is the Main Branch's heir. Naruto has set out to train
with Master Jiraiya. During that time, I want to train myself too,
as far as I can go. I don't know if my instruction
will be strict enough, but if that's all right with you… Yes, please! Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists! That was impressive, Lady Hinata. No doubt, she has the possibility
to develop further. Then… But, I'm not talking
about being a Hyuga. She does not have the disposition
to lead shinobi. What do you mean? Hinata is too gentle. Since I can't serve
as captain anymore, Team 8 has been disbanded. Everyone has scattered and
gone on separate missions, haven't they? I feel very badly about that.
Will you forgive me? Yes. Thank you. It's so easy when women
talk with each other. It wouldn't have gone
so smoothly with Kiba and Shino. Oh really? Of course not. Oh, it's Hinata. Shikamaru! Hello, Sensei. You must be busy. I'm on my way back
from a mission, but I don't have it as rough
as Lady Tsunade or my dad. You left the village? Tenten and I went to deliver
supplies to Naruto's ship. What? To Naruto? Yeah. He's doing fine. Oh, that's why this morning,
Tenten was… Apparently, Sakura, Ino and
Choji also met him by chance during a mission. Oh, by the way,
Lady Tsunade was looking for you. I wonder if it's a mission? Who knows? I'll stop by again, Kurenai Sensei. She's always been like that
when it comes to Naruto. So, did you decide on a name yet? What? For the baby. I've been giving it a lot of thought. Lady Tsunade! How could it end up like this? Where is Lady Tsunade? Oh, Lady Tsunade just… Now where is she supposed
to be at this time? She's scheduled to be
with the Cipher Division, but I doubt that things
are on schedule. I'll go and see. Okay, fine. Lady Tsunade left already. I see. The Cipher Division is working
on a secret code to be used by
the Allied Shinobi Force. We were chewed out because
we're running behind schedule. She said she's going to check
on the food supply situation next. – I'll go and see.
– All right. Lady Tsunade already left. What's up, Hinata?
Are you here to help? Well, no but… I wish they'd send more help here. We're getting food deliveries
one after another. Well, we don't know
how long the war will last! Damn it! Lady Tsunade mentioned that
she was off to check on Ninja Tools. Lady Tsunade has left. Tenten, did you see Naruto
while on your mission? Yeah, when I delivered supplies. Are there other missions like that? Well, I wouldn't know. Lady Tsunade said she's going
to see the Medical Corps. I'll try there. Lady Tsunade?
She couldn't come. I was told just to submit a report later. Everyone's been helping out here. I know a little about medicines. I'm in charge of the food pills. Oh, there you are! Hey! Tenten… What's up? What do you say we get together
tonight and do it up a little? At Barbe-Q! Barbe-Q?! I'm in, I'm in! Sounds great. You guys aren't invited. Huh? Why? Because it's time for just us girls
to hang out. Right? Let's have a girls-only get-together! For combat unit one through five, we'll assign personnel
according to their skills. The surprise attack will be
made up of the Ambush Unit and a few of the support units. They'll be balanced out with
shinobi from the Hidden Leaf and other villages. Stop talking so fast. Be more sympathetic
to the elderly. It's because of your age
that I'm counting on you. Oh? You have lived through
two of the Great Ninja Wars. I want you to pass on
the wisdom of your experience. Oh dear, I shouldn't have lived so long. You two are lucky. I've stopped drinking and gambling, and yet I still can't handle
all this planning. Lately, I've come to the conclusion that it's because
I don't have colleagues. Times were harsh for
your generation. Your class in particular, lost many. These days,
I even yearn for Orochimaru. And if he were here, I doubt that he would side
with the Hidden Leaf. Forgive me. I didn't mean to use you
as a sounding board. That's what I'm here for. Pardon my intrusion! What is it? The Feudal Lord would
like to speak to you. Damn it. This is why I can't
get any work done. Lady Tsunade… Oh, Hinata. Did you have a mission for me? No. I received Hiashi's report that Neji will be leading the Hyuga
on the frontlines. Yes. However, you must not take this
as a rejection of your skills. Just keep doing what you must do. For now, that will suffice. Lady Tsunade, the time… I know. But Father thinks… I'm not strong enough. BARBE-Q

 BARBE-Q

So Barbe-Q reopened! BARBE-Q

I made a reservation! Beef tongue with salt!
Beef tongue with salt! The new menu has
a special ladies combo! It's a good deal too! I just can't resist good deals! Frankly, I love offal! Did you decide on drinks? Okay then.
Excuse me! We're ready to order! Thanks for coming. Since they're having
a girls' get-together over there, we're having
a boy's get-together here. Let's eat and drink until
our bellies are full! What did the Feudal Lord
want to discuss? As if that was a discussion! He kept asking about what
was going to happen to him. What if this? What if that?
Over and over again! I'm done for today! Shizune! I'm going out to drink! I thought you swore off alcohol? I'm drinking tonight! Cheers! – Cheers!
– Cheers! So, what's this gathering for? Everyone's been so busy
preparing for war every day, right? We have to relieve
some stress once in a while. Yeah, you're right,
once in a while won't hurt. Usual missions are
completely gone. Every day is focused
on preparations. FrankIy, I really appreciate
being invited, but how does everyone here
know each other? Now that you mention it, why do we always end up
hanging out with each other? Maybe it's because we all took
the Chunin Exams together? Oh right, right. I guess we're like classmates. We did go on
a lot of missions together. The Chunin Exam… You were such a nuisance then. So were you. To be honest, I still don't get what this Allied Shinobi Force
is all about. It's like putting short ribs, beef loin,
heart, tripe, and liver all on one plate, right? I think having variety is a good deal! I'm not talking about meat here. Besides the Sand, the Hidden Leaf doesn't have
close ties with any other villages. I heard that there have been
many issues with the Cloud. Without a doubt,
it's not just the Hidden Leaf. Other villages also have
issues amongst themselves. Every village has some grudge
against another village. And still, the Fifth Hokage
agreed to an Allied Shinobi Force. That must mean the Akatsuki
is quite formidable. Well, when war breaks out,
we'll just have to fight our hardest. We just won't know
who will be next to us. But Kiba, you've never been
fearful of strangers. Shut up! It's just a pain to
remember their scent. When we're together like this, it brings back memories
of that mission. In the end, that Chunin Exam
was cancelled midway. Oh, you mean during the destruction
of Hidden Leaf Village? So many things happened, but we didn't lose anyone,
and we're all here now. It must mean we're part of
an exceptional generation. Yeah, I guess the only one
gone is Sasuke? Oops. I shouldn't have said that. Hey, come on back! You mean that time when
we went to get Sasuke back? But we failed. That's because
you didn't take me along. Are you still upset about that? It was a tough battle,
but we all made it somehow. Yeah… That turned out to be
a good experience. Now both of them
are depressed. – I'm not depressed!
– I'm not depressed! I'm glad I took the Chunin Exam. You lost to Neji, but you really
gave it your all, Hinata! It's because
he cheered for me then. Because Naruto cheered me on,
I was able to do my best. Naruto, huh. He was unpredictable even then, but who could have imagined that
he would become the village hero? Yes! Now it's our turn to protect Naruto. Our turn to protect Naruto. He can still be such an idiot though. No kidding! Oh, those are ready to eat. Let's eat! So you finally found your appetite? Yes, I need to become stronger. Here are the pork jowls! Yes! Pork jowls! Pork jowls! You're going to turn into a pig. What are you talking about?
This is full of collagen! I thought someone was missing,
and it's Naruto. Naruto would make
our group complete. I wonder what
he's doing right now. He's not having barbecued meat,
that's for sure. Besides, he's at sea. Fish. Not fish again. Some barbecued meat would
be nice once in a while! I've got to have meat with my drinks!
Meat! Meat! – Next, I want meat with my drinks!
–Lady Tsunade, please slow down. Come on! Let's snack on
something around here! What's all this?
A girls-only gathering? – Lady Tsunade!
– Lady Tsunade! Well… It's a girls' get-together! A girls' get-together? Move over, move over. But Lady Tsunade…
You're not really a girl anymo— Is it my chest?
Are you saying they're too big? First things first,
bring me a shochu! It's way past your first drink. So? What's happening? Are you talking about
the boys you like? We were talking about
the Chunin Exam days. Just reminiscing. With things the way they are now,
we thought getting together and having fun once in
a while would be nice. I see. Please help yourself. Sure. Hinata, about what I said earlier… I'm all right! I know what I must do. Thanks to all of you. You are all so lucky. All right!
We're gonna gamble! Time for the Princess Game! Lady Tsunade! Who is the Princess?! Did Tenten invite Lady Tsunade
to their girls' gathering? Talk about daring. The Fifth must be
pretty stressed too. BARBE-Q

Boy, did I eat! It's been a while since
I ate my fill of barbecue! BARBE-Q

Time for the afterparty!
Let's go! What'll we do? I'm going home.
I have an early start in the morning. Me too. I'm going back to work! Oh yeah, I wanted to finish up
some work tonight. I'm sorry, Lady Tsunade.
We're going to call it a night. – Thank you! Good night!
– Wasn't that fun? I'm going to get some ramen
for dessert. What a dedicated bunch. Yes. All right, let's drink until morning! Lady Tsunade! That's what I want to do,
but let's get back to work! Yes! Neji… I want to become much, much stronger. You are strong enough as you are now. This next war is to
protect Naruto. So I have to be much,
much stronger. I want to be strong! It's because of Naruto that
I've been able to come this far. Lady Hinata, I'm just like you. Thanks to him, I'm free. Welcome back. I'm home. I'll be all right. Thank you, Ko. Yes. You are from the Main Branch, so you should be leading
the clan on the frontlines. Right now, there is no Main
or Side Branch. You are the ideal one
for the job, Neji. Unless we join forces,
this war cannot be won. You've been livelier than
usual Bushy Brow Sensei!

 Of course!

 The feeling of standing firm
on your own two feet is the best!

 Well, it's only until we reach
the next harbor.

 By the way, Naruto,
I overheard this at the harbor,

 but it seems some imposters
may show up.

 Imposter? Just what kind
of imposters?

 Next on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's Imposter"

 What?! Who are you? Tune in again!

 It's been so long
since we traveled on land. Solid ground under
our feet feels great. No doubt about it, this hot blood of mine
is bonded to land. Well, this is only until
we reach the next harbor. About that,
can't we change plans and go to the Land of
Lightning by land? I doubt it. We are presently in the territory
of the Land of Water. The Land of Water is made up
of large and small islands. So they are not connected
to the Land of Lightning. Well… Just the thought of
getting on a boat again… So are we still far away from
the Land of Lightning? Yes. We have a quarter
of a ways to go. By the way, I overheard this
back at the harbor, but it seems some imposters
may show up. An imposter?
What kind of imposter? Hey, hey, hey! I have nothing against you. Just call it a twist of fate. I'm taking everything you own. Who are you? That headband? That's right! The great ninja who
kicked the Akatsuki out of the Hidden Leaf Village! Naruto Uzumaki, that's me! Seems he just appeared. Then that imposter
you mentioned… That's right. He's supposed to be Naruto? He's the spitting image of you. As if! Hey, hey, hey! How dare you ignore me!
What's so funny? Damn it! Hey, if you're Naruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf, then who the hell
am I supposed to be? Don't you know
your own name? How come you have
Hidden Leaf headbands too? Don't tell me… I'm the real Naruto Uzumaki! – No way!
– It's true! Imagine that,
an imposter of Naruto. I guess that's the price
you pay for fame. And... Just who are you? I'm… Hold it now.
If I can beat him here… All right then. Let's fight, right here and now,
to see who is the real Naruto! Quit talking nonsense! Naruto, do your best. If you lose, we'll make him
the real Naruto. I guess I have no choice. Naruto's Imposter

 You're all talk! That didn't even count
as a warm-up! We'll be confiscating what you have. But what'll we do with him? We're in a hurry. A guy like him… Let's just toss him over there. Are you sure about that? If he gets away and
starts stirring up trouble again, your reputation will take a hit. That is a problem. Hey wait, wait! And who're you? My name's Iggy and
I've been after this thief. Him? Yeah. The only ones brave enough
to stand up to this guy are myself and probably you. This guy is the notorious thief
everyone is afraid of! Naruto Uzumaki! No! He is not Naruto Uzumaki! How would you know
a thing like that? Because I'm the real
Naruto Uzumaki! What? You're the real one? Damn it! What a jerk!
Using my name and robbing people! If you're chasing the thief, does that make you
an officer of the law? W-Well, I guess you could say that. Then let's leave
the rest in his hands. We should be on our way. Sounds good. Hey buddy, can you manage him? You don't look that strong. What are you saying?
I may not look it, but… I am the master ninja Iggy! No kidding? Are you that strong? Looks sure can be deceiving. Well then,
please take care of things here. Okay, let's go! Damn it. Sorry, partner. You idiot! What if you were killed?
Are you stupid? I was going to beat him up. But you heard, didn't you? He was the real Naruto Uzumaki. Yeah. Of all places,
I never expected to encounter the real guy here. You idiot! That's enough
of your excuses, Banna! According to our plan,
you're the troublemaker and I'm going to beat you up
and build up my reputation. War's about to break out. I have to do something like this
to build myself up! By beating Naruto Uzumaki,
I'll make a name for myself! I know that. But isn't it time we stopped
dangerous stuff like this? You jerk! Did you forget what you owe me? If it weren't for me,
you'd still be all alone, crying your eyes out. Isn't that right? I-I'm sorry. Iggy, you're my one and only friend. Next time, let's find someone weaker
that even we can beat. Why you! "That even we can beat"?! A Naruto Uzumaki or two would
be a piece of cake for me! Forgive me, Iggy. As long as you understand,
it's okay. Is it true that Naruto Uzumaki is
robbing people in these parts? Yeah, no doubt about it. There have been
a number of victims. He's supposedly a giant
with a reddish face. But why would Naruto Uzumaki
stoop to robbery here? Isn't he a hero who saved
his village? I don't know the details,
but there are also rumors that Naruto Uzumaki was
considered a nuisance. Maybe he became a Rogue Ninja? If he's a deserter, then the Hidden Leaf
must be after him too. If we capture him, the Hidden Leaf will
pay us handsomely. But can we do it? After all, he's Naruto Uzumaki. Don't panic.
From what I hear, Naruto Uzumaki didn't even
pass the Chunin Exam. The legend of him being a hero
is probably a big exaggeration. I get it. For Mercenary Ninja like us,
he means money, right? Exactly. Well, considering my strength, I actually don't need to
resort to this stuff. Come one, come all! I preserve the peace for
the people and the world! The great Iggy, that's me! You're so cool, Iggy! When you're serious,
you're really strong, Iggy! You could fight in the war anytime! Damned right I can! Forget farming.
I'm going to be a war hero! Here, put this on. Then you'll be
Naruto Uzumaki again. Hey look, Banna…
I mean, Naruto. Here come our victims. There's no way you can lose
to peddlers like them. Nope. All right! Here I go! Hey, hey, hey! I have nothing against you. Just call it a twist of fate. I, Naruto Uzumaki,
will be taking all your belongings. Did you say Naruto Uzumaki? Uh yeah…that's right. So just put everything down and leave. W-What the hell? Aren't they peddlers? This is perfect! Naruto Uzumaki, eh? Imagine, you coming to us. W-What'd you say? Capture him! No way! W-Wait! He's not Naruto Uzumaki! He's just a petty thief named Banna. What? But he looks just like
how rumors describe him. And he's wearing
a Hidden Leaf headband. Well, that's because I… Who are you?
Are you his partner? Interfere and we'll get rid of you too. No, I… He's wrong! I'm Naruto Uzumaki!
He's not my partner! He's just a low-class farmer
from a mountain village! He hates working the fields,
so he pretends to be a ninja! He thinks my capture will
be his ticket to fame! That's why he's hanging around! Banna… Sheesh, a ninja wannabe. Well then, stay out of the way. Or we'll take care of you too! Let's go! What do I do? What do I do?! Finally, I'm not hungry anymore! Well, we'd better hurry. Wait, wait, wait! Please wait up! Thank goodness I found you. What's the matter? Well, I hate to say this, but some other thieves took
the thief you left in my custody. What?! I have to ask you a favor.
Please get that thief back. I thought you were a master ninja. Can't you get him back yourself? A-Actually, I'm out of shape right now. A ninja's always supposed
to be in shape. Sorry, but we have
urgent business to attend to. And besides, aren't you
an officer of the law? Why don't you go back
to your headquarters and get backup? Well, that's… So the thieves catch a thief. I'd say they're birds of a feather. You reap what you sow. No, it's not like that! He may've done wrong,
but he really wasn't that bad. Because of his looks and size,
people didn't like him. They were scared of him. He was always such
a weakling and kind-hearted. He's good at taking care of people. You sure know a lot about him. Well… Are you really an officer? I had my suspicions about you
from the very beginning. All right. I'll be honest with you. I'll tell you everything. And that's it. What were you doing? How could you think of
something so stupid? Please help me! You're the hero who saved
the Hidden Leaf Village, right? Hey, if you were his friend, how could you let him
do such a thing? If you were his friend, why didn't you seriously think
about his well-being?! Friend? G-Give me a break.
He's not a friend. He's stupid. It was just convenient.
That's why we stayed together. He's not a friend. "Not a friend"? What's the big idea?! Then just what is he to you?! You might have come this far
thinking he was just an idiot. But haven't you two been
together since you were kids? You've survived together! Wouldn't you consider
that being friends?! Naruto. This is an order. Okay, I got it. If we had time,
we would want to help you. But that's just not possible right now. Right now, we cannot afford to have our identities and
whereabouts known. You must forget
you met us here too. Let's go! Wait! Please! I can't do it by myself! You heard us. We can't help you. That's… Then what am I supposed to do? It's your problem. You figure it out yourself. He's my friend? Paper Bombs! Who is it?! Iggy? Why are you doing this? You… I knew it. You're his partner? I'm not his partner.
He's not my friend either. He's… my best friend! Iggy… Why you! Damn it! They got away! After them! Banna, are you all right? Why? Damn it! You're hopeless! If I didn't save you,
what'll happen to our next strategy? Iggy… All these years,
I've done nothing but use you. That isn't true. Everyone hated me
and looked at me like I was the devil himself. But you became my friend. You idiot. Back then, the others bullied me too. They told me that if I teased you,
they wouldn't bully me. I know that. But… Iggy, you became my best friend! Come on out, Naruto Uzumaki! We won't let you get away again. Let's show them
our willpower once last time! Yeah! Wherever you go,
I'll follow you, Iggy! Let's do it! Right! You novice. You think you can beat us
with that skill level? Take Naruto Uzumaki alive!
Kill the other one. I'm sorry. If I were strong like Naruto,
I could've protected you. Banna… Run! Banna! Thanks for calling me
your best friend. Die! Banna! What?! Damn it. You two are something else! Y-You guys… Sorry, but we didn't
believe you back there. So we decided to test you. Test me? Right now, I am totally moved! You didn't abandon your friend! You put your faith in friendship! Hey, hey, hey! Just who do you think
this person is? This here is the hero who
saved Hidden Leaf Village, the one and only Naruto Uzumaki! Shape up!
You are Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto… That's right. You're the hero of justice!
Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto Uzumaki is going to
go on a rampage of a lifetime! You can have your name back,
Naruto Uzumaki. The weight of it is too heavy to bear. Thank you, Naruto. Don't mention it. But what'll you do from now? Do you really intend
to become ninja? Nah, I'm going to forget about it. If this is how scary it is,
it's not for me. I'm going back to the country
and make an honest living. I'll go wherever Iggy goes. I see. Stay best friends forever, guys! – Naruto!
– Naruto! Thank you! Take care! Those guys sure can yell. Take good care of yourselves! Best friends are the greatest. We'll be like them too, someday. Sand Jonin Temari,
you will accept my challenge!

 Huh? What are you talking about?

 My name is Konohamaru Sarutobi.

 Grandson of the Third Hokage,
Naruto's favorite student!

 Naruto's…?

 Running away from this challenge
will mean that you fear me!

 Next on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's Favorite Student"

 This should be fun.
I'll indulge you for a little bit.

 Tune in again!

 Scatter! Morale is high and everyone is
ready to move into action as soon as the order is given. Good. All right. We can't just
stand around either! Moegi, Udon… Let's go! – Now, Udon!
– Right. Fire Style! Burning Ash! Hey, Konohamaru. You're overdoing it. Listen up. The village is
getting ready for war! We have to be ready to answer the call to arms
at any time too! We're still genin, so I doubt that we'll get
to battle right away. Besides, aren't there still things
that kids like us have to do? How can you be so relaxed? We've made progress since then. We have to distinguish ourselves and become the heroes
of this village! Naruto's Favorite Student

 Anyway, the time has come for us to achieve
great things for our village. But Konohamaru,
how are we gonna do that? Yeah, it's easier said than done. How can we? That's it! The Leaf News! What do you mean? Say, I'm from Leaf News. We're going to collect data
about the impending war. During the last incident,
we helped everyone evacuate. Is there anything else
that we can do? There sure is. Hold out your hands. There! Okay, carry those. Thanks a lot.
That was a big help. Sakura, please wait. You didn't tell us what
we can do to help in the war. We want to do something for
the sake of the village. Yeah! You're already doing something
for the sake for the village. This box contains medicine
to be used by the ninja who will be fighting
on the front lines. Not like that! We want to do something bigger like the kind of stuff
Big Brother Naruto does, you know? What are you saying? War is not playtime. Many people will get hurt
and they may die! Don't speak so lightly of
distinguishing yourselves! Man! Looking down on us
just because we're genin! But what Big Sister Sakura
said is true. I guess we should just… Don't give up so easily! What's the matter? You look kind of upset. Big Brother Shikamaru! What do we have to do to
get on the front lines and fight the Akatsuki? I brought down Pain. I'm a full-fledged Leaf ninja now! Well then, I have a question
for you, full-fledged Leaf ninja. Define the King that
you feel you must protect? "King"? If you don't know the meaning
of what I'm asking, then I cannot acknowledge you
as a full-fledged Hidden Leaf ninja. Here I go, talking big. Actually, I learned the answer
just recently myself. Anyway, there's no need to
push yourself so hard. I'll hear you out again sometime. Here. Ball? What does "ball" mean? You're so dumb! I wish everyone would stop
giving us the run around! All right then. What are you going to do? Who are we going to
interview next? We're not going to
interview anyone. We're going to demand that we be allowed to
take part in the war! You fool! Why?! I want to fight for our village
on the front lines! There is no place for you there! I brought down Pain by myself! I am fully qualified to fight
on the frontlines! You are interfering with my work! Get out! Konohamaru! Are you okay?! Damn it! Why?! Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday! Big Sister, is this? Yes. It's the First Hokage's,
our grandfather's, necklace! I love you, Big Sister! Damn it. Oh, someone is coming. We'll get yelled at! This way. Lady Hokage is expecting you. Right. Hey, that's… Temari, the older sister to the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village. Kazekage? I have a good idea. What're you thinking? This is a secret letter from
the Kazekage to you. Yes, thank you. I confirm that I have
received it from you. What a long way for you to come
during such a hectic time, just to deliver this. Not at all. I wanted to personally
assess the situation in Hidden Leaf Village,
a member of the alliance. It's been a while, hasn't it? The shadows of the past are gone,
but please stay and rest. Thank you, but I must hurry
back to the village. Please excuse me. Brother Shikamaru! What is it? Did you figure out
the meaning of "King"? – Konohamaru's in trouble!
– Konohamaru is… He's… What's wrong? SAND Hidden Sand Jonin Temari! You will accept my challenge! Move or you'll get hurt. I wonder which one of us
will get hurt. My name is Konohamaru Sarutobi. Grandson of the Third Hokage, Big Brother Naruto's
favorite student! Naruto's? Running away from
this challenge will mean that you fear me! Say that again, you brat! Here I come! Fire Style! Burning Ash! First Star. How'd you do that? Hey, kid!
You're just talk, aren't you? I'm not a kid! I'm Konohamaru! Kunai knives! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Second Star! It seems the Sarutobi Clan doesn't
have a decent heir left. I have no choice. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here I go! Third Star! That's enough! You're a hundred years away
from challenging me. You said you were
Naruto's favorite student. What a disappointment. Well, I shouldn't have
expected a guy like Naruto to have a decent student. Good job, Konohamaru! You're a hero in our village too! I don't care what you say about me. But I won't let you say anything
bad about Big Brother Naruto! What?! What is that? – Rasengan!
– Ninja Art! Wind Scythe— Shadow Strangle Jutsu! What? What is this? The jutsu passed on
by Naruto himself… The Rasengan. That brat mastered
a jutsu this powerful? Konohamaru… Are you all right, Konohamaru? Damn it! What are you doing?! If you had let me finish
completing the Rasengan, I'd have won! What was that for?! Because… Because you keep talking about distinguishing yourself
and winning, Konohamaru. It's like you're happy
that war is coming! That's not… Konohamaru! Remember that day! That day, I got separated from you,
so I headed towards District C. Then… Mommy, help me! He's in danger.
I have to get help. I'm the only one around. I have to help him.
I have to help him! Sota! Mommy! Sota! Fighting in a war isn't
the only way to help the village. When war breaks out, all the jonin and chunin
won't be in the village. What if the enemy attacks us?
Then what? That's right. We have to take the place
of those who are on the battlefield and protect the elderly and
the children in the village. Define the King that
you feel you must protect? I swear I'm gonna protect them. All the grandmas and the grandpas, and the children. Protecting the village is
a huge responsibility too. But boy, were you lucky. If you had kept fighting, you'd have fallen to
Temari's Wind Scythe Jutsu. Among all the kunoichi,
she's known as the cruelest one. Still, you're something else,
pushing me to that limit. I-I…I… I will report to Gaara that fine young ones are coming up
among the Hidden Leaf. In a few years, I'm sure
you'll be a good shinobi. Konohamaru… What'll we do from now? What else? This village is Grandpa's,
the Third Hokage's, treasure. So I'm gonna protect it! Because I'm the grandson
of the Third Hokage, who protected the Village Hidden
in the Leaves! And because Big Brother Naruto
promised me that one day, we'd fight
for the title of the Hokage! I'm gonna train more until
I can pulverize Big Brother Naruto! Because becoming
the Hokage is my dream! Is that what Konohamaru said? I'm certain of it. I see. So Konohamaru
said that, huh. Not just this necklace! This village is Grandfather's treasure. So I'm going to protect it. Because I'm the grandson
of the First Hokage, who founded the Village Hidden
in the Leaves! Such big talk. Remember, men don't go
back on their word! I know! I'm gonna become like Grandfather and take on the title
of Hokage one day. – 'Cause becoming the Hokage is my dream.
– 'Cause becoming the Hokage is my dream. I wonder how he's doing. Getting a marriage proposal
so quickly like that.

 Naruto, you're really popular!

 It's nothing like that!

 Just because Pervy Sage made
some careless promise,

 I'm paying for it now!

 Well, we are heading to
a secret a mission,

 so getting involved in any foolish
disturbances will be problematic.

 We should avoid any
unnecessary trouble.

 We should rest early and leave
first thing in the morning.

 Next time:
"The Kunoichi of Nadeshiko Village"

 Don't! Stop chasing me!

 Tune in again!

 Thanks for the food! Boy, I ate my fill. But that sure didn't compare
to Ichiraku Ramen! What was that? You again! Don't you ever give up? My business isn't with you,
you're just the attendant. I want to fight the princess
next to you! Impossible! I won't allow this. Lady Shizuka, there is no need
for you to dirty your hands with a man like him! This is my destiny. Please stand back. You're as beautiful as ever! Just hurry up and
become my wife! Nadeshiko Style!
Roaring Hurricane Kick. What?! You'll pay for this! You were brilliant, Lady Shizuka. Please wait at the inn. I will check on the travel arrangements
for the ship. Thank you. That lady is some shinobi. But that's none of my business. Please wait, sir. From that headband, I see that
you are a Hidden Leaf shinobi. Yeah, that's right. May I ask you something? It's about Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Legendary Sannin. Well, rather do you know anyone
who was his student? The Kunoichi of Nadeshiko Village

 Of all the places, what a shock to find
the person we're seeking here. We were about to board
the ship headed for Hidden Leaf Village
to look for you. I was just as surprised to hear
the Pervy Sage's name out of the blue. But how do you know about me? Didn't Lord Jiraiya
tell you anything? About what? I'll tell you then. The connection between
Lord Jiraiya and my village goes back several decades. Don't lose sight of him! We must teach him what happens
 to those who infiltrate our village! Damn it. I just came to do
some research for my next book. They're so cute, but boy,
 they're dangerous. Resign yourself. Sorry, but I can't do that. Mister Gamaken! Secret Technique! Exit Jutsu! I'm quite ungraceful so… Don't let him get away! – Right!
– Right! Brr! It's cold! This is rejuvenating! I didn't expect you to
pursue me this far. Your technique last night
was quite amazing. You didn't just come here
 to tell me that, did you? I've seen your skill and
would like to make a request. A request? Hidden Leaf Jonin, Lord Jiraiya. Please duel with me with
my hand in marriage as a reward. Stop! Where are you going with this?! Nadeshiko Village is matrilineal. To put it bluntly, only women
are born into our line. What? Only women? And so, candidates for leader leave
the village in search of strong men and challenge them. Men who defeat us are brought
back to the village to become our husbands. That is the law. Between them, the duel was
a clash of honed ninjutsu skills. But in the end,
the match was never decided. So they made a promise.
The duel would be postponed. And if their rematch did not occur, it was decided their students would
seek each other out to continue the fight. So that means… I would like you to duel with
Lady Shizuka in earnest, with the reward being marriage. M-Marriage? This is all too sudden! It's not sudden at all. This was decided during
your master's time. But I heard it just now! That is your problem. In any case,
a promise is a promise. You must agree or
we will be in trouble! I'll be in trouble if I agree! So anyway, let's just say
we never had this conversation! Wait! This duel must take place,
no matter what. A marriage proposal,
just like that! You are quite popular, Naruto.
I envy you! It's not like that at all,
I tell you. Just because Pervy Sage
made some careless promise, I'm paying for it now! Well, we are on
a highly classified mission. So we can't afford to get
into any foolish disturbances. Should we move up our departure time? Yeah, good idea. Luckily, we've restocked our supplies. We should get to sleep early and
leave first thing in the morning. I think I drank too much tea. Time out, okay?
Give me a minute. This is too much.
Following me all way out here! There is no escaping me. You are an important candidate
for a husband. Listen, I already turned you down. I don't know what
your village tradition is, but I'm not taking part
in such a weird duel. But! If you have to fight,
go pick somebody around there and… Please don't say such things! Lady Shizuka doesn't enjoy this either. She is actually very kind-hearted. However… I want to stay like this forever. Then let's do so. But… I know your position. But to be able to pick a husband
only through battling is ridiculous. Sagiri. I am a tradesman who
has been granted entry into the village. I'm not strong, but I love you
more than anything. I want you to be happy. That's why I will do everything
in my power to change the village's law some day.
I swear it. No one knows for sure,
but it has been said that it was a plot by a few concerned
about the future of the village. He was attacked and easily killed. Certainly, he wasn't someone
fit for the Nadeshiko. That's… From that day on,
Lady Shizuka locked away her heart. She stopped loving, so that she would never lose
someone she loves. She only thought of
fulfilling her duty, seeking and challenging
those who are strong. It's like she was punishing herself. So you want me to fight her? You are the student of
the formidable Jiraiya, who fought the previous leader
to a draw. You may be able to put
an end to her fighting. I am fully aware that
this is a selfish request! But please, will you agree
to fight Lady Shizuka? I don't think we're being watched. We should be okay
once we leave the port. Well, Naruto, you gave up
your chance to become a groom. I'll be able to buy
some time this way. Naruto, I am deeply grateful
that you have agreed to a duel. Sorry, but I didn't come here to fight. I came to talk. What? I heard about your situation. But there's something weird
about this. I'm here to fight you. So I can see how strong you are. This will do. Earth Style! Iron Prison! I'm not going to do this. This is my destiny. Please let me begin. Nadeshiko Style!
Roaring Gale Chop! Nadeshiko Style! Aerial Dance! They just keep coming! Naruto, you are strong indeed. But you can't just keep dodging. Spinning-Waltz! There's no end to this! Gale Fan! I guess it's over. Yeah, I guess so. It's over. A diversion in the second stage. No one has ever gotten behind me. Just deliver the final blow. I already told you.
I didn't come here to fight. I'm not interested in a duel. Then I'll take the woman. Gotcha! What a cowardly thing to do! This trick is nothing! Hundred Puppet Bind! This jutsu drives "bolts"
into my target each time one of my
100 puppets is beaten. And now, you are my puppet. Don't tell me all those puppets
from before were just for this? You coward! I did it! Now Shizuka and
Nadeshiko Village are mine! Let her go. We weren't done talking.
Let her go. Shut up! This is none of your business,
so get lost! I'm going to use her and… Rasengan! Why did you save me? I've had just about enough
with everybody! I didn't mean that! You had a chance to defeat me! And would you have been
satisfied if I did? Just because it's "your destiny," you locked away your heart
to look for a husband. Isn't that silly? I mean, I don't know anything
about marriage and stuff, but don't you have to love someone
and be attracted to each other? That's… I have a girl I love named Sakura. Well actually,
it's one-sided on my part. Sakura is totally in love with
a guy named Sasuke. She tries so hard, chasing after him
and trying to win his love. When she's at it,
her smile is the cutest thing. There's no explaining it. Before I realized it,
I was in love with her. I would never try to
force her to love me. I'd be no different from
that guy just now if I did. So I made up my mind. In the same way that Sakura tries
so hard to win Sasuke over, I'm going to do my best
to win Sakura over. But my destiny… That's not destiny! It's just a rule that the village made up. Yes, but… Use your abilities to put an end to it. I'm not sure if
I explained myself well, but that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Naruto! It's Captain Yamato! You went off on your own again! This is the second time
you've fooled me with your Shadow Clone. I hope you're prepared
for the consequences. No! We'll set sail soon. I'll be right there. Take care of yourself. When your mission is over… When you return to your village,
will you tell that person you love her? No, I don't have the ability
to do that yet. For now anyway,
I'll just keep watching over her. Are you satisfied with that? Sure, nothing would make me happier
if she chooses me someday. But it's okay. As long as Sakura is happy,
that's what counts. I want you to be happy. Sorry, but this fight ends here. Unfortunately, I've already
given my heart to a woman. Although it's one-sided
on my part. One-sided love?
Someone like you? She's lost the people she loves,
one after another. So now she rejects love. I've sworn to watch over her and bear the weight of
her future on my shoulders. Even when there's no reward
for you? As if I care about such a little thing! I'm going to surround her
with love and pray for her happiness! I understand. Let us consider this duel
a draw for now. So I have to challenge
this man's student. Shizuka… Without a doubt,
you bear the burden of your destiny. But remember, there is no need to
lock your heart away. Lady Shizuka… Let's go, Tokiwa. I will become much stronger. And one day… Yes! It's true that the war
is going to start.

 To say that I'm not afraid is a lie.

 But whatever happens,

 I have hope that we will
all live through it.

 It's because I have friends
that I trust.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Friends You Can Count On"

 You'll understand one day too.

 Tune in again!

 What's this? A bug. Here, of all places? You must be adventurous. Going all the way to
the Land of Lightning. Speaking of bugs, why does this remind me
of someone? Um… Let's see. "Friends You Can Count On"

 Hey, is it true that a war is starting? Yeah. My dad was saying we're going
to pulverize the Akatsuki. It's true. A war that will decide the future
of the shinobi world will begin. Will you be going to battle too,
Shino Sensei? Yes. Are you scared, Sensei? Stupid! Sensei would never be scared. No, you're wrong. Are you scared? No way. But I'm confident that
I will come back alive. Why? It's because I have friends
that I trust. All right. If I can block both hands… So you two are the decoys
and he's the main one! However… Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu. Those who specialize
in long-distance jutsu tend to be weak in close combat. You're too weak. But I guess that's what you get
with an insect master. Shino! Are you all right, Shino? You're too weak. But I guess that's what you get
with an insect master. I see. He got away. I'm ashamed of myself. Don't worry about it. We received more intel afterwards. He's a jonin from
the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls who went rogue and
became a bandit. It just couldn't be helped if
you were no match for him. I'll make the report to Lady Hokage. We're very sorry. Don't blame Shino. I know. But he's shut himself away
in his house. That guy has so much pride. That's a problem. Listen. I want you to help him
get back on his feet. How are we supposed to do that? He wouldn't listen to us. Well, this is an order. I want you to go to the hot springs
on the south side of the village. Take Shino. What do you want? You're on to us. Shino, how is your wound? It's nothing to worry about.
What do you want? What's wrong with us
just coming to visit? Aren't we all on Squad 8? Don't worry about it. There's nothing wrong
with losing once. Our enemy was a jonin,
and we're not even chunin yet. It's a given that he's going
to be better than us. Well, you have it in your head
that you're strong, so I guess it came as a big shock. K-Kiba… Or are you depressed
about something else? Don't tell me you're upset about
Naruto's indifference towards you? Don't let it get to you. Unlike me, he can be pretty rude. Oh, I get it. The fact that you were
the only one who didn't participate in the Sasuke retrieval mission
is still weighing on you. You were on a different mission then,
so it couldn't be helped. Get lost! Nope. We're heading out
to a hot spring in the southern part of the village. Why? Your wound will heal faster there and… I have no intention of going. I figured you would say that. But you can't refuse.
It's an order. Man, he's so hard to be around. He hasn't spoken a word to us. You're just as difficult
to be around, Kiba. MORI-NO-YU
HOT SPRING We're finally here. Let's just rest up today. All right, Akamaru,
let's go take a soak. Yahoo! What? Are you coming too? Do you have a problem
with that? N-No. I hope that when he's naked, he's not covered in insects… Gross! Aren't you coming in? Well I guess seeing is believing! I sure am! He's pretty normal. I think I stayed in too long. What the hell is that?! Can we train with you? What are you doing? Nothing. Why aren't you being up
front with us? Don't hide it.
You're practicing taijutsu, aren't you? Let's train together! Besides, that's why we came here. What are you up to? We're going to train with you
and make you stronger. This is the only way to help a proud guy
like you get back on his feet. And if we get some training in
at the same time, we'll be killing two birds
with one stone. You're concerned about
being forced into close combat while manipulating your insects, right? That's why you're training in taijutsu. So that you won't lose
when you're targeted. You're correct. So let's train together. Taijutsu training is more effective
when you have a partner. I-I may not be that skilled in taijutsu,
but I think I can help. I think the first thing is speed. If you can overwhelm your opponent
with a lot of moves, you can prevent him
from weaving signs. I have no objections. I'll begin. I'm going to pick up the speed. Hinata is serious about this. Hey, hey! Aren't you upset that Hinata
got the better of you? No, I'm not. That's because I don't judge people. I can't get a rise out of this guy. Shino, think of me as
that bandit shinobi. You're too weak. But I guess that's what you get
with an insect master. You're starting to get the hang of it. Here! You're not always going to face
a single opponent! Pay close attention to
your surroundings. Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
All-Four Jutsu! Once you develop your speed and
field of vision, next is visualization. What's "visualization"? Well, it's seeing through your opponent. Like knowing his weakness and
not letting him get the advantage? Having a counterstrategy and always
keeping it in mind when you fight? Yes, exactly! I see. When you have a lot of moves, you're only thinking about
what's directly in front of you, and you lose focus of other things. But I don't need to worry.
I have one more brain. Right, Akamaru? MORI-NO-YU
HOT SPRINGS WOMEN W-What am I doing? I'm worried about
the two next door! Shino is really focused. He's improving right before
my very eyes. Such amazing progress. I've never sparred with Shino, but I didn't expect him to
be this good in close combat. Still, I cannot lose! Now then.
Let's go with the final test, Akamaru! Fang Over Fang! What's the big idea? You dodged that well. That was the final test. What? In ninjutsu, my Fang Over Fang
ranks as the fastest. Dodging my Fang Over Fang from
a blind spot is quite impressive. Your training is complete. And that means Squad 8
has been revived. Right! No, I have no interest in being part
of your three-man squad. Why not?! Because I have no right
to be part of it. Without a doubt,
I have grown stronger. However, I'm not confident enough
to watch your backs. Shino. I'm sorry. Hey! How dare you say that to us! Hinata and I both did our best
to help you get back on your feet! And believe me, I'm grateful. Don't give me that! Stop it, Kiba! I didn't think you were so pitiful. It's Kurenai's Sensei's
messenger pigeon. Read this. Shino, that bandit is near! I'm going! Oh, but it says not to engage until
Kurenai Sensei gets here! I know that! We won't fight him. Tracking is
Squad 8's specialty! So I'm going. And this time,
he's not going to get away! I'm coming with you! So long, Shino! Shino, why didn't you avoid
Kiba's punch earlier? I know you can now. That's because… I still believe that Squad 8 can
count on you to protect us, Shino. It's up ahead. Byakugan! Found him! Anyway, let's just track him! Right! They're here. This scent. He's on to us. Looks like he's not going to
just let us track him. Here he comes! Fire Style! Red Spider! Damn it! The only way to go is up! Kiba! Look! We're surrounded. You guys again. You should know your place! Blue Joro Spider! I won't let you escape! Fire Style! Flame Hurricane! It's over. These are insects. – Shino!
– Shino! You again! Blue Joro Spider! I can't move like this! I'll start with you first! – Shino!
– Shino! I know your weakness. You're too weak. But I guess that's what you get
with an insect master. What?! Well then! Ridiculous! I will not lose to you. That's because I'm not
the same person I was back then. If close combat isn't
going to work, then… What? I can't weave signs. Not yet! Not by a long shot! How dare you hurt my friends! How dare you insult me and my insects! Shino is so strong. Take that! Iron Tackle! Gentle Fist! Let's go, Akamaru! Let's finish him! Kurenai Sensei! I guess there's nothing
for me to do here. Of course not! But it was mostly Shino's work. Well, yeah… Looks like Squad 8 has made
a full recovery! Yup! Shino, I'd put my life in
your hands any time. Me too. All right. That's because… You don't have to reason with us! I guess not. Since I made it all the way out here, I thought I should have a soak
in the hot spring. It feels wonderful. Imagine, beating him by yourselves. You've really gotten strong. But I admit I nearly panicked when
it was just you and Kiba. Kurenai Sensei, by any chance, were you watching us
the whole time? What are you talking about? Don't tell me you knew that the ninja
was hiding near this hot spring? That was just coincidence,
sheer coincidence. Eww gross! Will you cut it out?! You'll understand one day too. There is no need to fear battle. That's because our friends
always have our backs. – Right!
– Okay! We understand! Who was that? I can't remember. Back in our academy days,

 all the girls admired and talked about
that one strong and beautiful person.

 That's why I decided to

 become the legendary kunoichi,
Lady Tsunade.

 That's the dream that
I decided to chase after.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ah, My Hero Lady Tsunade!"

 This is a story from my past.

 Tune in again!

 Here I come, Lee! I'm ready! Primary Lotus! How's that? It's heavier than what
you can handle, right? Lee! Lee? Come up, Lee! That was nothing! Lee! I used to dream about this
when I was a little girl. Her name is Lady Tsunade. They say she's really strong! Yes! That's Lady Tsunade,
the legendary kunoichi! I've decided! I'm going to become Lady Tsunade! From today, you are all genin. I want to take this time
to hear your goals. I don't want to answer that. Sensei! I want to prove that even without
mastering ninjutsu or genjutsu, one can become a great ninja! That is what I live for! Hey! What's so funny?! Listen, if you can't use ninjutsu
or genjutsu, you can't be a ninja. What? Are you stupid? No. That's not necessarily true,
if one has the passion. If you spend your youth
with a good rival, sparring together
and honing your skills, there's no doubt
you will become a fine ninja. But you will need determination. Yes! And you? Oh, I want to become
the legendary kunoichi, Lady Tsunade! Ah, My Hero Lady Tsunade

 Youth! Fight! – Fight!
– Fight! LadyTsunade, huh. Her taijutsu was simply amazing.
She has monster-like strength. There are rumors that she almost killed
her teammate Master Jiraiya, who along with her was
one of the Legendary Sannin. What must I do to become that strong? Sheer determination! – Fight!
– Fight! – Fight!
– Fight! – Fight!
– Fight! Fight! 1121! 1122! – 1123! 1124!
– 1123! 1124! – Eleven hundred and…
– 1125, 1126! 1154, 1155! 1156, 1157, 1158, 1159. 1160! Okay, Lee! Go! I'm trying my best, but I'm not getting any stronger. How long will it take to get
to Lady Tsunade's level? Lady Tsunade inherited
the talents of the First Hokage. So are you saying talent is
more important than determination? Oh no!
What I'm trying to say is that each shinobi is suited
to different things. No one can say whether you will develop superhuman
strength or not, Tenten. Stop right there! Lady Tsunade has more than
just monster strength, right? Right. She is a specialist
in Medical Ninjutsu. They say that there isn't an illness
or injury that Lady Tsunade can't heal. Please teach me Medical Ninjutsu! Well, what I teach is a little different
from Medical Ninjutsu. How do you do it? Please teach me too! Yes, well… It's energy and guts! Oh, that again. Still, I think you have passion
in wanting to learn Medical Ninjutsu! That's the right spirit! I will speak to
the Medical Corps for you. Yes! That ends the lecture
on high-level Medical Ninjutsu. We will now begin hands-on training. All right. As its name suggests, Medical Ninjutsu is ninjutsu used
in healing by controlling chakra. Yes! You use your own chakra to stimulate
the chakra network of your patient… Yes. and revitalize the cells. I think perhaps… I was told I wasn't suited for it! Well, don't let it bother you. There are many fine kunoichi
who cannot perform Medical Ninjutsu. But I want to become like
the legendary Lady Tsunade. Isn't there any other skill that
makes Lady Tsunade legendary? There is the Summoning Jutsu. She can summon a giant slug. That's why she was also
called the Slug Princess. The Summoning Jutsu? Yes, that's right. How do you do Summoning Jutsu? Well, it's a type of
Transportation Technique. But first we have to see if
you have the skill to use it. All right, ready?
Try it. Something appeared! Amazing! It seems you have the ability to do
the Transportation Technique. Now, you need to enter into
a contract with the one you will summon. Summoning Jutsu! Guy, are these your students? It spoke! A ninja tortoise? Way to go, Guy Sensei! – Umm…
– Huh? You don't have a slug? Isn't a tortoise better than a slug? What did you say, little girl? Do you have something against me? Well, you're just not legendary,
I guess. Such insolence! Well, I refuse to enter into
a contract with you! Tenten, don't be so selfish! It's not easy to find a partner
for a summoning contract! Oh? Is that so? Anyway, keep training! Okay. Is there anything else
that Lady Tsunade is legendary for? Well, her love of sake and
gambling is legendary. However, you can't emulate that. KURAKU
SAKE

However, you can't emulate that. I mean, you're just a little girl.
It's impossible. Sake! The drinking age is twenty. GAMBLING HOUSE
MARUSEI

Hey! Let me go! Stupid! I'm going to become just like
the legendary kunoichi, Lady Tsunade! Did you say Lady Tsunade? Then come back when
you're much bigger! Lady Tsunade's big chest
is legendary! Legendary…big chest. Today is the day!
I'm going to beat you, Neji! What's the matter?
Something troubling your youthful heart? Lee, you never learn, do you? You can't beat him! Neji's not like you. He's a genius. Lee! Come up! You never give up, right? Lee?! Stop, Lee! He's being controlled
by the enemy! Neji, find the user of the jutsu.
I'll stop Lee! If you cannot use
ninjutsu or genjutsu, you'll definitely be susceptible
to an enemy's jutsu. It makes me uneasy to be on
the same team with someone like that. No matter how hard I try,
I keep thinking, "What if I don't get any stronger?" It scares me so much
that I can't take it! If you don't have faith in yourself,
it's not worth the effort! "Even if I can't do ninjutsu
or genjutsu," "I want to prove that
I can become a fine shinobi." Isn't that your Ninja Way? I think that's a wonderful goal! If you intend to take on ninjutsu
and genjutsu with only your taijutsu, you must perfect your taijutsu
so that it can be superior to them. I am going to have you open up
to number five, the Gate of Closing, of the Eight Inner Gates. The Eight Inner Gates. Is that the Forbidden Jutsu that
eats away at the body of the user? I am prepared for this. Please teach me the Forbidden Jutsu! This is all for my dream! Sensei! Those are the rules! It was decided that if I lose,
I would walk around the village on my hands 500 times
with you on top. Oh boy. Please don't get me
involved with your silly made-up rules. By the way, if you didn't win, my punishment for failing
to train you properly was to hoist Neji up on top
and do 800 laps! It's amazing! Even if you had a handicap,
you made Guy Sensei lose! I just did what I could. Tenten, you are a Ninja Tool specialist. I'll say! Only Tenten
can battle like that. Ninja Tools? I'm a Ninja Tool specialist! Me… A Ninja Tool specialist?
Yeah right. Next, please examine
my student Lee! This way, Lady Tsunade! On that day, I saw the person I had admired
ever since I was little for the first time. And that person… Forget about being a shinobi. Her words to Lee were like
a death sentence to him. No. No, no, absolutely not! Something like this cannot happen! Then does this mean that
determination means nothing? Does it mean that if
you don't have talent… Tenten! Don't take Lee's resolve lightly. Nor your own resolve and passion
up to now, and beyond. The odds that the surgery will
be successful are 50% at best. If it fails, you will die. But Lee, you underwent the surgery. And immediately afterwards,
you went to save our friend. Guy Sensei! Tenten! Lee! Lee, my boy! You've recovered! You've bounced right back! Lee! Yes! Guy Sensei,
thank you so much! Thank you! Lee! You! Lee! You never give up,
no matter what! And because you always go for it, I tell myself not to lose to you
and I'm able to give it my all too. Don't give up, Lee!
Don't lose to something like this! Lee! Lee! Lee! I was at my absolute limit. So did it work? No, it was no different from before. In order to move up a level
in the Eight Inner Gates, I need even more rigorous training. I sure could use
Guy Sensei's guidance right now, but that's impossible right now. If you're okay with me,
I'm happy to… – One…two…three…four!
– help anytime. – What are you doing?
– Five…six…seven! Oh, don't mind me. This is my own rule. When intensive training doesn't work,
I make myself do 10,000 push-ups. – How long will that take?
– 17…18…19… Just ignore me. 23…24…25…26… 27…28…29…
30…31…32…33… T-Tenten… Heavy, so heavy! Hey! You're making it sound
like I'm heavy! You should say, "The metal doll
you brought out is heavy, so heavy." Say it. You're so rude. I no longer wish to be like
Lady Tsunade anymore. But I haven't given up my dream
to become a legendary kunoichi. I was just taking a walk to see
how things were going in the village.

 Your argument reminds me
of Naruto and Sakura.

 Sakura's hit me like that
before too.

 What? Well, they're more like
comrades than friends.

 You're asking me what the difference
between a comrade and friend is?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Sai's Day Off"

 That's a difficult question.

 Tune in again!

 Oh, so you draw. I thought you were drawing
a landscape since you're outside. But it's an abstract, isn't it? So do you have a title for it? Well… You haven't decided on one yet? I don't know. To be exact, I couldn't title one of my drawings
even if I wanted to. Nothing comes to mind. I don't feel anything. Your drawing's... nothing special! You're right. Just like your "equipment." I'm going to be honest with you! I don't like you. If you've got a problem,
just drop the fake smile and tell me straight to my face! I'll fight you anytime, anywhere! I don't have a problem with you. I don't care about you at all. Work on the central part of the city
seems to be going smoothly. Sai's Day Off

 There's not enough help
along the perimeter of the village. All right!
Let's start the treasure hunt! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Hello? Is there a lost doll in here? I'll take you back home with me. It's dangerous to play here. The rubble might fall and
cause it to cave-in! I didn't mean to scare her. What happened? That man said... Wow! You're good! It's the children from earlier! Are you a manga artist? Or are you a painter? Or are you a wandering traveler? No, I'm not. Then what are you
doing drawing here? I had the day off today, so I took a walk to see
how things were going in the village. Hey, hey can you show us
your other drawings? Well, my drawings are
not for others to see. Oh no, I shouldn't have
said it like that. I managed to fool them. Wait! I got you! Stay, stay. Don't move! My pants just ripped! Hey! You went home yesterday
with torn clothes too. My dad says kids should be energetic and
active enough to have stuff like that happen. Put yourself in
your mom's place sometimes. She's the one who has to
mend them day in and day out! Uh-uh, here we go again. Shut up, ugly! Who are you calling "ugly"?! – My mistake, my mistake!
– Hey wait! Cha! Ouch! It's just like watching
Naruto and Sakura. I'll teach you! Ouch! My head got hit! That's right. Sakura hit me
hard like that too. I'm sorry. Please forgive Naruto. It's okay. It doesn't bother me. Really? Thank goodness. I don't care if
you forgive me or not. You fooled me, with that
fake smile of yours earlier. Although that was much
too intense just for a joke. Are these your friends? Huh? Well no,
I guess they're my comrades. Aren't comrades your friends? That's a difficult question. The bond that Naruto feels
with Sasuke… Perhaps I've never experienced
anything that strong. Sai, stay out of this. Naruto, you don't have to
get punched for Sasuke's sake. Sasuke keeps hurting you
over and over again. If I were you… I just felt I should do something,
as a member of Team Kakashi. But because of that, I think I made things more painful
for Naruto and Sakura. It's like Naruto has
been shouldering the burden of his promise to you. As though he intends to bear
that burden for the rest of his life. I don't know what you told Naruto. But it's no different from
what was done to me. It's like a Curse Mark. Sasuke is the source of Naruto's agony. But aren't you a part of it too? Sasuke keeps getting farther
and farther away from me. But Naruto, you've always stuck by my side
and cheered me up. I finally realized, Naruto, your true self. Meanwhile, Sasuke keeps
adding to his list of crimes, and breaking my heart. Continually becoming more
of a stranger. But Naruto, I'm able to
be close to you like this. You comfort me. I care about you,
from the bottom of my heart. Cut it out, Sakura.
This joke isn't funny at all! I hate people who lie
to themselves! As a result, Sakura set out alone
to settle things with Sasuke. After I told Naruto about
Sakura's true intentions, he was in such turmoil,
that he lost consciousness. If I had been a true friend, would I have handled it differently? I've never been here before. We need to gather
more workers tomorrow. Wouldn't it be faster if we used
Paper Bombs to clear everything? Idiot! If you do that,
you'll blast away everything! – We can't do that!
– Yeah, you're right. Oh, excuse us, fella. So the damage extends this far. How terrible. By chance, are you related to
the family who lived here? No, I'm just passing through. Oh, pardon me.
Well, I live next door. I was going to let you know
if you were family, that they are staying at
the evacuation shelter. I'm glad they're okay. Yes, although their house
is totally ruined. I understand it's going to
be demolished tomorrow. I see. They say all things eventually decay. But this is still so tragic. Everyone is gone, and I can feel the loneliness. Good evening. What are you doing? It's obvious just by looking
that no one lives here. No, but I was thinking more along the lines of
something else "living" here. Do you mean ghosts? That's ridiculous. Keep your opinions to yourself! Okay, okay.
We'll be spending the night here. You are such an idiot! Sai. I need to talk to you. Sai, I want you to fight me seriously. And what good would that do? Just fight me and
you'll understand. I'm aware of your strength
without having to do that. Then try and dodge me! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Damn it. I see. He's trying to prevent me from
using my Super Beast Scroll. Sorry, but I'm leaving right now. He's persistent. I have no choice
but to settle this. Naruto, Sai! One minute you're both gone, and this is what I find
you two doing? Really, how many times do you
have to make me repeat myself? You started it, didn't you, Naruto? And Sai, don't accept
a challenge so quickly. Anyway, I'd say this match… goes to Naruto! I misjudged you. I never thought that you'd transform
into Captain Yamato. I didn't expect you to be so sly. You totally fooled me. All this time,
I thought you were only capable of straightforward
and direct combat. But don't think for a minute, that this kind of victory means
you're stronger than I am. If you do, you're just being smug. It's not like that at all. Remember what Captain Yamato said. You and me, we're a team. When one moves,
the partner backs him up. We have a buddy system. From now on,
as we try to get Sasuke back, if an enemy appears
and gets in our way, we need to know how
we fight to be more effective. You're more level-headed than I am. You might figure out a way to
make better use of my strengths. That was in the back of my mind. And then, if Sasuke returns, I'll be able to leave
Team Kakashi, right? Yeah, I can't wait. Naruto firmly believed that
he would bring Sasuke back. And after working together, I started to feel the depth
of his conviction. But as for Sasuke… How do you do?
My name is Sai. So you're Sasuke Uchiha? Get lost. Sasuke! Such cold, frightening eyes. And deep within, that coldness
was like a smoldering fire. Naruto must have seen
those eyes too. All the time you wasted
pursuing me might have been
better spent training, right, Naruto? That's why this time around, my whim is telling me that
you'll lose your life. When I saw those eyes, I knew that no words
could reach Sasuke. But Naruto's feelings
didn't change at all. I used to really hate Sasuke. But it was actually fun being with him. He's the only person who
acknowledged me, more than anyone else. Sasuke is my friend. It's a special bond
I was finally able to make. Even so, with Orochimaru
as your opponent… If my arms get ripped off,
I'll kick him down. If my legs get ripped off,
I'll bite him down. If my head gets ripped off,
I'll stare him down. If my eyes get gouged out,
I'll curse him out. Even if I get chopped up
into pieces, I'll take Sasuke back
from Orochimaru! Until then, I lived in a world
filled with lies and betrayal. Naruto made me remember how important it is to
have faith in people. I wanted to see just
how strong this bond is. So I withdrew from
my mission and made up my mind to
bring Sasuke back. And here I am today,
still a member of Team Kakashi. Please don't mention Naruto's actions
when you report to the Hokage. Say there's no movement yet. It seems you still do not trust me. You work under Danzo and your job is to keep
an eye on Naruto. However, you are also
a member of my Team 7. So I do believe in you. What is this feeling? Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura. I don't know what
the future holds, but I have a feeling that those
three share a bond so strong that no one will be able to break it. And some day, I will too. You really are like him. My older brother. He was talkative and
he would lose his temper. He had no manners
and his "equipment" was… Well, never mind. But, just like you, he put all
he had in everything he did. When I look at you,
I kind of remember him. Is that? I remember. I remember! This is what I wanted to show him. The picture of our dreams. Well, well. Just as I expected.
That was perfect teamwork.

 Aren't you…

 You're Kosuke, right?

 Who is this again?

 He's been a genin for fifty years.

 He's Kosuke, also known
as the Eternal Genin.

 We've met him before.

 That's right!

 I was much obliged
to you back then!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Legendary Ino-Shika-Cho"

 I want to ask you something.

 Tune in again!

 Damn it! He's so insensitive! Hey, come on. Should you be fighting
with your dad when the Great Ninja War's
about to start? But… I'm coming in, Ino. You're so stupid, Dad! So, what do you want? Well, you seem so
preoccupied lately. So I was wondering… if you wanted to,
you could talk to me. There's nothing. I'm not completely clueless
to what you're going through. You're a young woman now. What's that supposed to mean? So which one did you pick? So is it Shikamaru or Choji? Who did you decide
to go out with? Why should I go out
with you guys? And most of all, he has the nerve to enter
a lady's room without knocking first! Hey, why are you
taking it out on us? Calm down. Inoichi is just worried about you. Remember,
you did cry a lot over Sasuke. So he's not far off the mark. That's because it
happened so suddenly. Besides, worrying about Sasuke
isn't going to do any good. I've decided to leave it
to Sakura and her team. Well, it seems Ino's over it. With war looming, our teamwork would have suffered
if she wasn't focused. I guess Ino's going to be okay. Hey, Choji, are you… You're to blame! You started it! H-Hey! You're the one who
complained first! Stop it!
Just what is going on here? Stay out of this, you fat— My body is moving on its own! Shadow Possession Jutsu
complete. You shouldn't be fighting when the village is in
the situation that it is… But he… No "buts"! You'll never be popular
with the girls if you argue over small things. – O-Okay.
– O-Okay. Now go over there
and play nicely. – Okay.
– Okay. As usual,
that was perfect teamwork. Aren't you? Umm…who is he? Kosuke, right? He's been a genin for fifty years. Kosuke is also known as
the Hidden Leaf's strongest genin. We've met him before. Really? Oh yeah!
When we were still genin. Yes. I was much obliged
to you back then! The Legendary
Ino-Shika-Cho Trio

 If this Intel will spare
my comrades in the village from danger I will gladly give up my life. I must do everything I can to deliver this scroll
to the Hidden Leaf. I won't let you escape! No one has ever escaped
the clutches of the three brothers. We won't let you get away. Big Brother,
aren't we going after him? What an interesting old man. Iwaji, Iwazo… That's just a Substitution. He has sharp eyes. Don't underestimate me,
old man. He's fast too. We won't let you go! Earth Style: Earth Hold! I said, we won't let you escape! He has considerable strength too. You're wasting my time, old man! Trying to steal Intel from
the three of us, huh? Well, we'll return the favor and make you tell us
everything about your village. My enemy has
no vulnerabilities. I guess my life will end
on this moonlit night. Reinforcements? What is that?! My body just… Shadow Possession Jutsu…
complete! Ino! Mind Transfer Jutsu! Hey! This is not the time
to joke around. You men have some nerve attacking our comrade
from the Hidden Leaf! "You men?" Well, it's payback time! Are you turning on us,
Big Brother? You too?! Get ready! O-Oh, if it isn't… It's over. You can release your jutsu, Ino. What the hell is going on? This is the Hidden Leaf's Secret
coordinated ninjutsu formation… Ino-Shika-Cho! All right! Mission accomplished! Your formation today
was spot on, guys! Your training is paying off. Are you all right? Whatever the reason, going off on a solo mission
is too reckless. I never expected to be rescued twice
by the Ino-Shika-Cho formation. That's right. You're Kosuke, the person we
rescued back when we were genin. Yes. I'm very happy
you remembered. I just remembered too, but… You said something
interesting back then. You said you had been saved twice
by Ino-Shika-Cho's formation. Did we rescue him twice? I'm not sure. My life was saved twice
by Ino-Shika-Cho. Yes. It was the day before the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf Village. It was late at night, but the village was
abuzz with excitement for the next day's festivities. That smells delicious, Kosuke. Am I intruding? If you don't mind a hotpot stew
made by an old man, please join me, Lord Third. With pleasure. Tomorrow is the main portion
of the Chunin Exam. Yes, that's right. It's so delicious! I'm only good at things like this. What are you saying? The only enjoyable part of a mission
is sitting down to eat. Many specifically request you
to be on their team. No matter how risky the mission,
if you so order me… Do not take your life so lightly. Thank you for the food. It was mighty delicious. By the way, Kosuke… Will you accept one mission? The Chunin Exam is
an opportunity to check the power balance
between the villages, so some mutual distrust
is to be expected. But I just feel so uneasy this time. Hopefully,
it's just my imagination. A message from
the Third Hokage? Choza! Not so loud! S-Sorry! So what did Lord Hokage say? It is too early in the season for
the leaves to be dancing in the air. He said you would understand. Message received. A special code
between Sarutobi Clan and their three houses, huh? Impossible?! Leaf Ninja Art! Yanagi! Which enemy
infiltrated the village? Expansion Jutsu! M-My body… Is this your first encounter with
the Hidden Leaf's Secret… Shadow Paralysis Jutsu? Then take this one too! The Hidden Leaf's Secret… Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Mind Destruction Jutsu. Stop! What's wrong?! I can't control my body! This brings back old memories! It's a reunion of
the Ino-Shika-Cho Trio. I am also a shinobi
of the Hidden Leaf. I may not be skilled, but I will gladly give up my life
for the sake of the village. I won't allow you to ravage
the Hidden Leaf Village any further! I will sacrifice this old body, and take as many fools
as I can with me! Kosuke… He charged right into the enemy. Are you going to
let him go, Shikaku? Let's do it! You mean,
the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation? I hope you haven't forgotten it. If I forgot it, I don't deserve to wear the earring that
represents our oath of brotherhood! That's true. Let's do it! All right! You always make
good shadows for me. Ten…twenty… Thirty-three… Shadow Stitching Jutsu! Black Spider Lily! Deliver the finishing blow. Mind Destruction Dance Jutsu! Damn it. I never want to face
you guys in a fight. Oh, that's right. Are you all right, Kosuke? Now then… Let's move on to the next area! Shikaku, Inoichi. As expected of the Hidden Leaf's
most powerful Secret Ninjutsu Formation,
Ino-Shika-Cho! Uh-huh! Ino…Shika…Cho… Mind Destruction Jutsu! Shadow Paralysis Jutsu! Expansion Jutsu! The way you battle
has such depth. You overwhelm your opponents while
instilling courage in your comrades. A splendid formation that transforms
your comrades' fears into bravery. The power of your experience,
judgment and most of all, your faith is magnificent! It's nothing like that, Kosuke. We're just stuck with each other,
whether we like it or not. Yeah, yeah. Don't tell anyone. We just don't want to look bad
in the front of our kids since we all live in
the same village. Right? Huh? Well, in any case, our kids will
surpass us in no time at all. The seedlings of
the Hidden Leaf Village are growing soundly. I survived once again…huh? Anyway… it's going to be such a pleasure
to watch the seedlings of the Leaf grow into giant trees. Our dads fought a battle like that? Our dads are amazing. And here, I thought our formation
had gotten much better. Compared to our dads,
we still have a ways to go. If you don't mind my saying,
a shinobi isn't made in a day. I look forward to
your Ino-Shika-Cho formation when you have reached maturity. I should be more careful, so you don't have to
come to my rescue again. Well, our dads have their thing,
and we have our own thing. No sense in getting
worked up over this. You're right. I think I'm all grown up, but I guess in my dad's eyes,
I'm still a just a child. It's a fact that we haven't
reached our dads' level. We have to think that the enemy
is stronger than them. Which means,
this upcoming war is… I wonder what kind of
enemy we'll face. From the time
when we were genin, all we thought about
was running away. You're right. We were always scared and
looked for the easy way out. Y-Yeah. If we put a positive spin on it, you could say we really
knew ourselves well. That's right. We're weak! That's why we're always
thinking about how to stay alive, about all the ways to
beat a stronger enemy, and about what
the best strategy is. I'm counting on you, Ino, Choji! We may not match up to our dads,
but we won't be going to war alone! So let's do what we can,
in the best way possible! The only thing we can do is to do
our best as the people we are now. Until now, we've stayed together
and done all right. So even with this next war… We'll be okay, right? What? Y-Yeah. We'll be fine, just fine! Okay, guys,
let's get into the spirit! Let's go! – Right!
– Right! Damn it, what a horrible morning!

 My dreams were bad,

 and everyone is saying
Naruto this, Naruto that.

 That can't be helped.

 Naruto is the village hero right now.

 When we were kids he was
the worst in our class.

 During the Chunin exam,
if it weren't for his fart, I would've…

 There are no "ifs" in battle.
That's because…

 You're so annoying!
Just you watch!

 I'll catch up to him!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kiba's Determination"

 I won't be left behind!

 Tune in again!

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,500
Here I go! Over there, huh?! Sakura! Cha! <i>The Third Kazekage


</i> <i>That noise just now...
<i>What happened?</i> <i>It sounds like it came from the direction
<i>of Sakura and Granny Chiyo...</i> <i>But I've no way of verifying that...</i> <i>And the radio is out of range now...</i> <i>I've seriously got to hurry...</i> <i>Damn it! We can't make any progress
<i>just by chasing after him!</i> Kakashi Sensei! You're too slow! We'll lose sight of him if
we don't get a move on. It'll be okay! His next target is you, Naruto! He won't run off so far that
he shakes us off completely. Then hurry up and
tell me how to stop him! Don't worry. I've got
several strategies in mind. I'll need a little bit of time
to prepare for that! I can't wait around for that. I want to save Gaara right away! <i>I don't know what their strategy is,</i> <i>but I'm sure lucky
<i>the Jinchuriki is so simple-minded.</i> <i>I'll stir things up so they can't prepare.</i> <i>I wonder if they can keep up
<i>with my speed.</i> Damn it! Hold it! Wait, Naruto! <i>Sure enough, I guess I can't
<i>get through to him now...</i> <i>I have no choice.</i> <i>I'll quickly finish things off with that...</i> Guys, did you all...
hear that noise? Yeah! Loud and clear. It sounds like it's coming
from the enemy hideout... That noise!
What in the world is going on?! Can you see
what's happening, Neji? I'm in the middle
of fighting right now... So it'll be tough to convey
anything precisely. The enemy hideout is collapsing
at an incredible rate! Did you say collapse?! What does that mean?! Did Sakura and Granny Chiyo win? Or did they get beaten? No, I can't say which for sure. Because... They're both fighting
an evenly matched battle. Did you say evenly matched? I'd expect no less from Sakura! I also must not lose! She's got impressive strength
for a little girl. <i>In just this short time,</i> <i>she's starting to read
<i>Sasori's attack patterns.</i> <i>So much so, that she can do just fine
<i>even without my help.</i> <i>I never thought she would be
<i>this good...</i> <i>She's an impressive girl.</i> She's got impressive strength
for a little girl. <i>In just this short time,</i> <i>she's starting to read
<i>Sasori's attack patterns.</i> <i>So much so, that she can do just fine
<i>even without my help.</i> <i>I never thought she would be
<i>this good...</i> <i>She's an impressive girl.</i> <i>That Tsunade sure has herself
<i>a good pupil.</i> Listen up, Sakura. For Medical Ninja, attack ability is
of secondary importance. Do you know why? Yes! Medical Ninja play
a supporting role in the unit. Comrade support in battle
is more important and I think medical ability comes first! Wrong! What's most important is the ability
to dodge an enemy attack. The ability to dodge...? A Medical Ninja absolutely must
never get hit by an enemy attack. Why is that? Who's supposed to heal
the members of the unit if the Medical Ninja dies? Now I'm going to attack you
for real. This is training for you
to dodge all of my attacks... I won't hold back! <i>Now I'm going to attack you
<i>for real.</i> <i>This is training for you
<i>to dodge all of my attacks.</i> I won't hold back!
Are you ready?! Y-Yes! Don't shut your eyes! What's the idea shutting your eyes
in front of an enemy?! Watch the enemy's movements closely! Before their attack,
during their attack, after their attack! Don't overlook any little movement! If you're any kind of sorry excuse
for a Shinobi, you've probably heard of this. People each have dominant hands,
dominant legs and habits. For many different reasons, a fixed pattern is revealed
when they move. Once a Shinobi becomes
a Chunin or a Jonin, they train to reduce those habits so as not to telegraph that
pattern to an enemy... But it's not something that
can be completely eliminated. With that, you should be able to see
an enemy's weakness! An enemy's weakness... You have to find that weakness
as fast as you can! Then you should be able
to improve your ability to dodge attack! <i>His fingers always move
<i>before he attacks...</i> <i>That's obvious since
<i>he's controlling the puppet</i> <i>with the Chakra strings on his fingers...</i> <i>But that's the weakness
<i>of a Puppet Master.</i> <i>And I've started to read
<i>the direction of Sasori's attacks</i> <i>with the patterns of his finger
<i>and arm movements.</i> <i>She's watching very carefully...</i> <i>At this rate,
<i>this will be too time-consuming...</i> <i>I have no choice
<i>but to use some Chakra.</i> <i>I guess I'll finish her off with </i>that... Iron Sand: Unleash! <i>Its range is huge!</i> This is not good! Sakura! Sakura, are you okay?! <i>Listen carefully, Sakura...</i> <i>First, get close to him</i> <i>and smash the puppet with
<i>your incredible strength.</i> <i>However, you must dodge
<i>all of his hidden device attacks.</i> <i>All of them, perfectly!</i> <i>You must not even get a scratch.</i> <i>Poison, right...?</i> <i>That's right...</i> <i>Even a scratch can turn
<i>into a fatal wound.</i> She's been poisoned! Didn't I tell you...
"That's not all there is"? As I suspected, he soaked his Iron Sand
with poison, huh...? The poison is starting to take effect... Soon your body will go numb
and you won't be able to move. You'll last three days
if I leave you be... But I've no intention of doing that! You're finished...little girl. Sakura! Say, what can you do
in three minutes? Oh, I can make instant noodles. You're too soft. I can cut green onions
on top of that! Then, I can munch on snacks
on top of that! Then, I can brush my teeth
on top of that! You're being soft.
If I sleep with my clothes on, then in three minutes, I can get out of bed
and head straight to the mission with a noodle in my hand! Wait! Don't tell me you plan to do that
without washing your face first?! - I always do it that way.
- Say what?! Naruto! Brushing your teeth and
washing your face is a daily etiquette! What, really?! I didn't know that! Next time:
"Three Minutes Between Life and Death" As always, the one who gets there first
will win all of this! Don't you worry, Akamaru.
I'll split it with you. What are you talking about?
I'm going to win. No way, I'm going to
get all the candy! Choji, are you really
going to go for it? Kiba's going to win anyway. Leave it to me. I never lose
when food is on the line. Shikamaru! If you're out, keep time for us. Damn it, what a pain. Hold it! I accept your challenge! You don't have a chance. Go away! Go away! Naruto's too easy to beat! But then, we'll have more candy. You're right. Anyone can join as long as
they put up some candy. Of course! I have some here! That's way more than I can eat! Don't talk like
you've already won! It's already been decided,
you're a loser. Well, I'll go on ahead and
give you the starting signal. Yeah. I'm going to be first! He'll signal soon. Bring it on anytime! Yahoo! All right! What's my time? It's a new record! M-My candy! Damn it! Kiba won again. But we did beat that idiot. My candy! All right! Once more! Let's race one more time! Stupid! Challenge me
after you beat my time. I'll come in first,
no matter how often we race. It was a dream. Kiba's Determination

 No breakfast for sleepyheads! Honestly! There's a war
about to start, you know! A war? You can count on me! I'll crush all of them by myself! Fool! You are such a fool! Don't take war so lightly. Your classmate, Naruto,
is the village hero, but look at you! You're so miserable! All right! I'll go train then! Why'd she have to
bring up Naruto? Getting an earful of that
early in the morning is annoying! This is all thanks to Naruto,
our village hero! Yeah! We're alive today,
thanks to Naruto! Let's do everything we can
to get the village back to normal. – Right!
– Right! What an unpleasant morning. You think so too,
right, Akamaru? What? Don't tell me you're on
"Mr. Hero's" side?! Damn! It's the same
with everyone. Sure, he did save the village, but… When we were kids,
that guy was such a loser. Are you talking about Naruto? S-Shino! Naruto is the village hero
right now. But he used to be the class loser. And who lost to the "loser"
during the Chunin Exam? You did. Made it! Oops! If it weren't for his fart,
I would've been the winner! There are no "ifs" in battle. That's because
you can't turn back time. There he goes with
his stupid logic again. Also… Naruto has
surpassed us considerably. I'll definitely catch up to him! That's understandable.
However… Like I'd let Naruto leave me behind! There's no way
I'm going to get left in the dust. See ya! Fang Over Fang! Damn it! It didn't work. You don't have to tell me.
I have to power up some more. Oh? Are you training? Well done! Well done! What's wrong?
You're not your usual self. I want to become stronger. Stronger than Naruto. Naruto? I've known him
since we were kids. I don't want him to get ahead
of me any further. Kiba… I know! Please train me,
Kakashi Sensei. Kurenai Sensei is pregnant and Guy Sensei is away
from the village! You're the only one
I can rely on right now, Kakashi Sensei! You know Naruto's strength
better than anyone else, right? Since you put it like that,
I guess I have no choice. Sensei! I'll help you! Ninja Art: Summoning! Earth Style,
Fanged Pursuit Jutsu! What? I would love to help,
but I'm really busy. So, I'll leave it to these guys
to spar with you! You can't do that,
Kakashi Sensei! This isn't training!
Not with these guys— You want to be stronger
than Naruto? In your current condition? Don't be ridiculous!
I was just careless. I'll make you take back your words! I'm doing this because
Kakashi asked me. But we don't have time
to waste either. So, you better put
some serious effort into this. Kakashi Sensei ran off
with a lame excuse, but I'll drag him back here
in no time at all! Make any claim you want, after you steal this scroll
off my back. Sounds like fun.
I'll end this quickly! Ninja Art: Beast Mimicry! All-Fours Jutsu! You rush in and
neglect coordination. Crane Wing Formation! You said you wanted to
be stronger than Naruto, so I wanted to see
what you had in you. But if this is all you've got… Damn you all! I'm not going to care if
I end up hurting you! Stop yapping and
just show us! All right! We'll go at
full strength this time. Ninja Art: Beast Mimicry!
Man Beast Clone! Man Beast Secret
Taijutsu Technique! Fang Over Fang! Scatter! Like I'm going to let you
get away! Circular Formation! Ninja Hound Art! Dust Dance! You can go beyond
our range of vision, but you can't escape
our sense of smell. Over there! He falls for such simple tricks. Damn it! At this rate,
he'll never surpass Naruto. There's no hope for him. He loses his cool
before a fight, doesn't try to assess
his enemy's strength, and charges ahead eagerly,
only to self-destruct. Hey! Where are you going? I quit! Forget it! I can't fight seriously
against dogs! So you're running away? I originally asked
Kakashi Sensei to train me! Instead… You said yourself that
you would end this quickly. He got that part right.
It ended quickly. He lost. Shut up! Fighting you is pointless,
that's all! Getting hurt over this kind
of training is not worth it. So you're running away. If you're not interested, then go. Yeah, I'll do just that! Let's train on our own, Akamaru! I'm not running away! Even if I continued
with that training, it would have been useless! Hey, Akamaru!
What the—? Where are you going? Hey, Akamaru! Akamaru! Where are you going? Stop! I said to stop! Ouch! Hey, this is… Naruto? In the end,
he couldn't beat me. Hey, Akamaru! Wait! Oww! I know. I was always on top. NARUTO 3:33
KIBA 3:37
KIBA 3:40
KIBA 3:41 How come his name is…? Oh, Kiba! Hinata, why are—? Ever since our Academy days,
I've been coming here to train sometimes. It's because Naruto used to
run here all the time. Naruto? Yes. Back then, he was so determined
to break your record. Damn it! I can't do it at all! N-Naruto? Why can't I? Damn it! Damn it! I almost did it! Damn! Damn! Damn it! Damn it! I did it! It's a new record! NARUTO 3:33
KIBA 3:37 Naruto ran every single day
until he beat the record. Isn't it just like him? Akamaru, did you know that? Damn it!
That idiot is so stubborn. Why doesn't that loser give up? Damn it, he's such a fool. He's so stubborn, that loser!
That stupid loser! Sorry I made you wait. I thought you ran away. I figured I should quit giving up. Akamaru! So you're starting off
by surveying the field. I won't charge into rocks
and self-destruct anymore. It seems you've had
a change of heart. I'm supposed to take that scroll
from your back, right? This time, I'll make you
take back your words. Akamaru! Let's do this! Ninja Art: Beast Mimicry!
Man Beast Clone! Fang Over Fang! Scatter! Hound Barricade Formation! Scatter! Dodge, Akamaru! Akamaru! Assemble! Are you hurt, Akamaru?! So you were able to avert
a head-on collision. Well? Do you want to quit now? I told you I quit… giving up! So you quit? Yeah, I quit. I see. Hey! That's not what I meant. I quit giving up. I'm not quitting training
with you guys! So you're not quitting? No, I'm not! Even I wanna… be like… Like what? Yeah, umm… Oh! I'm… going to become a fool! – …going to become a fool!
– …going to become a fool! You already look like a fool. No! I mean… You're a fool, right? Yes…I mean, no.
It's a different kind of fool. A fool is a fool. No, I don't mean that. Just what are you trying to say? That's why… Oh man! I'm never going to
forgive you guys. What? It's not our fault
that you're a fool! Shut up! Inuzuka Style!
Man Beast Team Transformation! Scatter. Let's go!
Wolf Fang Over Fang! This one is intense. He's thinking.
This way, he avoids friendly fire. However, I don't think
a tight turn will work. Dust Dance! Not that again. It's all right, Akamaru! I know the terrain through
the Dynamic Marking! Ninja Hound Art!
Hound Hair Clones! We're going to plunge right in! You can't tell where the real one is. Damn it! I get it! He just said "where,"
instead of "which"! That means… the real one isn't here! Calm down, Akamaru! Stay calm! Stay calm! It's useless, you should just quit. Shut up!
I said I'm not going to quit! Oh yeah. Calm down. Stay calm! Stay calm. With both our noses,
Akamaru and I will sniff out even the faintest of scents
and find him! He's there! You got me, Kiba. I take back my words. Oh my, Pakkun, he got you?! I was defeated. Kiba, you did well! Thank you, Kakashi Sensei! No need for thanks. I really didn't do anything. We'll never quit! Never! If we refuse to quit,
maybe one day… What is it, Guruko? Earlier, he said… – …going to become a fool!
– …going to become a fool! Maybe he meant he wanted
to be like Naruto? He wouldn't say that. I mean, KIBA 2:58
NARUTO 3:33

even Kiba has his pride. Once we finish replenishing our supplies
on this isolated island,

 we'll set sail immediately for
the Land of Lightning!

 Our goal is in within sight now.

 Complacency is
our greatest enemy!

 The enemy will try to invade through
any gaps in our mental readiness.

 But since we're this close,
we can call for backup

 from the Allied Shinobi Forces
if anything happens.

 Those Allied Forces could
be transformed enemies!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Kakashi, My Eternal Rival!

 Oh! Knock on wood!
Knock on wood!

 Tune in again!

 Kakashi… The Kazekage suggested that you be appointed
a troop commander. Why me? You took part in the battle
of Kannabi Bridge during the Third Great Ninja War. There aren't many veterans left
from that war in any village. This is also
a direct order from me. Then I guess I can't refuse. However, I have one request. What is it? One man can't wage a war. I need a shinobi as
my right-hand man to assist me. Is there someone that
you trust implicitly? That man is presently on
a mission escorting Naruto. That would be… Turtle, turtle! This is… Guy's ninja tortoise that
he only uses in an emergency! At last! It's calmed down! Are you all right now? Not to worry.
These waves are nothing. He's been seasick during
this whole journey. And he's still acting tough. Well, since we're all here… We'll be entering the seas off
of the Land of Lightning after we make a final stop
to replenish our supplies on this isolated island
in the Land of Water. So we've turned the last corner. Complacency is
our greatest enemy. The enemy will seek
any opportunity to attack. But… Since we're this close,
we can call for backup from the Allied Shinobi Forces
if anything happens. But those reinforcements
could be transformed enemies. What?! Even if it's people we know well,
like Lady Tsunade or Kakashi, we mustn't let our guard down. N-No way! If we jonin can't even distinguish
their chakra, what good are we? I've heard a rumor that
there's a Transformation Jutsu that can copy and transform chakra. W-What?! Hey. Oh! My eternal rival, Kakashi! Oh, knock on wood…
knock on wood! And… let me emphasize
that Naruto must not learn the real purpose of this mission. I'm talking to you, Guy. I know! This S-rank mission
is just a cover! We are here to protect Naruto. Gotta hurry! Go! Rasen-pee! Hey, what're you all doing together
this late at night? What? Well, I'm getting a massage. A massage? Yup! We totally weren't leaving you
out of a secret—! Hey, you wouldn't be… hiding something delicious
from me?! Are you? Are you?! If we had something delicious,
we'd let you know. Good night. We were just discussing
the remaining schedule. Guy, please take care of the rest. Okay! You can count on me
to stand watch! Something funny is going on here. Kakashi, My Eternal Rival!

 I can keep watch by myself. Why don't you get some sleep? I've had nothing to do
except sleep during the day. So I can't fall asleep now. I wonder what everyone
in the village is up to? I haven't seen Kakashi Sensei
in quite a while. Kakashi, huh. People call him
Might Guy's eternal rival! This is a good opportunity to
tell you about our younger days. You don't really have to… Our rivalry began right around
the time we first became genin. You don't really have to tell me. Move, you're in my light. People call me Might Guy,
the Leaf's Blue Beast! Aren't you one of
the super elite? You're the White Fang of the Leaf,
Sakumo's son, right? What about it? I have a bad habit. Whenever I see a guy
with innate talent, I get the urge to challenge him! So? How about we lay our youth on
the line for a hot-blooded battle? I don't like doing things
I don't have to do. You were born an elite, whereas I am elite
through sheer effort! I think we could have
an amazing rivalry. Your humor leaves me speechless. Hey! What about my challenge? I refuse! That makes me even
more determined! I never back down
once I make up my mind. That's my own rule! Let's fight! Let's fight! It's like an acorn. Fight me, Kakashi! I don't want to! Fight me! Kakashi finally succumbed to
the intensity of my passionate, youthful determination
and accepted my challenge. I feel bad for Kakashi Sensei. And that's how we forged
our bond of rivalry. Yeah, but I wonder about
the kind of fights you had. What are you saying?! We gave it our all with
honest, serious battles. Although I must admit, I'm hesitant to describe
some of them. Bow and arrow,
sickle and chain, shuriken. I beat you in all of them. Satisfied? Not yet! I challenge you
to a sparring match! If it's taijutsu,
I won't lose to you! It seems you have enough
to brag about. A prodigy indeed, with skills inherited from
the White Fang of the Leaf! He is so quick to run away! It's heavy! Leaf Hurricane! You're mine! Maybe I overdid it a little! A substitution ?! Have you had enough now? From now on,
just know your place. Let go, you scum! No. I'm not finished
challenging you yet. Don't run away. I'm not scum. I've beaten you in every challenge. What did you have in mind next? Here I go! Come on! – Rock, paper, scissors!
– Rock, paper, scissors! – Again! Again! Again! Again!
– Again! Again! Again! Again! I won't say anything about
challenges like that one. I think I'll go to sleep,
after all. Hey, the good part
is just beginning. Man… I'm starting
to get sleepy too. Guy! Hey! Guy! Did someone just call my name? Over here! Over here! Oh, it's you, Kakashi! Huh? Why are you out on the water? Ouch! It's not a dream. Could it really be? They can disguise themselves as someone we know very well,
like Kakashi, and even copy his chakra
with a Transformation Jutsu. Could this be
the Transformation Jutsu that Yamato spoke of? I won't be fooled. I cannot allow the enemy
to get near Naruto. What nerve to disguise himself
as my eternal rival! I'll strip his fake hide
with my very own hands! Yeah, be right there. Hey, how are things?
What happened? So, that's his line. He's making it sound like
we sent a signal for help. But I won't be fooled so easily. What do you mean,
"What happened?" Well, you sent an SOS, didn't you? What a fool.
Telling such a bold-faced lie. But attacking him out of
the blue is too childish. I'll wait until I have
irrefutable proof that he's a fake. But how can I…? Is there anything between
Kakashi and me that an enemy couldn't
possibly know? I know! That! There's that! Oh, by the way… How do we stand on
our rivalry battle? What's our win-loss record? What? This isn't the time
to discuss that. I knew it! He may look identical, but he couldn't have delved that
deeply into our private affairs. I see, so you don't know. Well sure, I remember but… What? You know? Of course. I'm winning, 51-50. Right? Yes! He finally gave
himself away! But never mind that.
What was the reason for the SOS? There's danger right
before my eyes. Severe Leaf Hurricanes! What's the big idea? As expected. You didn't just take on
Kakashi's appearance, but his speed too! Go! You can't escape my taijutsu,
no matter how much you run. You didn't call me just to
continue our rivalry, did you? You're a fine imitation. If you're real,
then copy my taijutsu! Just like
"Copy Ninja" Kakashi would! Are you really Guy? What did you say? The real Guy knows that
my Sharingan can't copy everything! Just like an imposter to
accuse me of being the fake! What's all the commotion? It's Guy! I thought
I didn't see him around. That doesn't sound like
something trivial. Let's go! Right! What can I say to
make you believe me? Are you going to keep denying it? Guy! Oh, you're just in time! Well, if it isn't Kakashi! Hey, how've you been? Hey, don't let him fool you
so easily! He's a fake posing as Kakashi! What? No matter how you look at it,
he seems like the real Kakashi. Yes. You're Kakashi, right? See? But he won't let me
off the hook. Don't be fooled, Yamato! It's just as you said. He even transformed
his chakra exactly into Kakashi's! And I have lots of proof! Now, the three of us should… Hey, you guys! Did you ever consider that you might be trapped in
the enemy's genjutsu? Or maybe,
you're still not feeling well from being seasick
for days on end. Right? He's not normal, is he? So you'd rather side with
the impostor than listen to me? I see! I get it! You're all fakes! He really is acting strange. I'll use my Wood Style to
hold down his movements. As if I'd let you! Eight Inner Gates!
Sixth Gate of Joy, open! This is bad! He's serious! Dive into the sea
as deep as you can! Asakujaku! Just what proof do you
have that I'm an impostor? I'll tell you! It has to do with our battles
as eternal rivals! There is no way you would get the win-loss record of
our battles wrong! It's 51-50 in my favor,
there's no mistake. Or maybe, you're just bitter that I took the lead after
our last match. What? So you were watching that
battle from somewhere?! How should I put it,
I'm the real one. You fake! That match tied us!
You and I are 50-50! Tied! No, you're wrong. Huh? There was the sushi-eating
contest after that. Where I won right? I can't eat another bite. I forgot about that! No! You must've been watching
that from afar too! Will you cut it out? You almost killed us! Then do you want me
to reveal your secret, the one that only I would know? That's interesting. If you know of such a secret,
I'd like to know too! What? Guy has such
a fine physique, but it's the size of an acorn? That small? Maybe we should
call him the "Little Beast." It's not like that anymore! That was back
when I was a kid! Kakashi, I really thought the enemy
had infiltrated us. What are you doing here anyway? I already told you! You sent your Ninja Tortoise
SOS to us. So I rushed on over. So back then,
when something whizzed past us… Guy was sending
his Ninja Tortoise out? That time? Oh! Ouch! Turtle? Help me. Turtle? Turtle! Hey, didn't something
just fly past us? Yeah, something did. I'm sorry. So you caused this, Guy. How are things back
at the village? He just changed the subject. Well, things have gotten
a bit complicated. What's wrong? I'll contact you again
once it's all decided. Oh, okay. By the way, are you going
see Naruto before you go? No, he has you with him. Oh, you're right. Guy! Yeah? If anything should happen to me,
you'll rush over right? Damn right, I will.
Don't you worry about that. I thought I heard
Kakashi Sensei's voice. Huh? Hey, are you excluding me again? You are hiding something
delicious, after all. No we're not. Liars! Then why're you three
huddled together suspiciously? We're observing the heavens! We're observing acorns… Stars sure are small! Hey! Why are the Stone
and the Mist fighting here?

 That's what I want to ask!

 They just attacked us out
of the blue!

 Move it, Leaf!

 If you're going to interfere,
I'll kill you too!

 Please stop, Ganryu!
This violates Lady Mizukage's will.

 Per my orders…

 I'll have to make you stop!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's Vow"

 If there's something I can do…

 Tune in again!

 This is serious! Is something wrong? How much longer before
we reach the island? There's been no wind, so… But we'll be okay. We're supposed to rendezvous with
the Tsuchikage's messenger by… That's going to be too late! What? Chojuro? I'm going on ahead! Please follow
as soon as you can! I give up! The ground is still shaky… You were seasick until
the very end, weren't you, Guy? The end? After we replenish supplies here, we will head straight to
the Land of Lightning. I see. A lot of things happened, but it looks like
we'll accomplish our mission. By the way, where's Naruto? Miso and pork broth is good,
but seafood broth's great too! Damn it. He dashes out
before you can stop him. We'll be staying here
for a night. And it's a small island.
There's no harm in that. Whoa… It's still shaky. Guy… From here on out,
it's the Land of Water, huh. Still, what a tiny island. Hey, we should stop
moving around so much or the people we're supposed to meet
won't be able to find us. So what? We arrived early, didn't we? – We should look around while we can.
– Guy! Are you all right? – It's taking a while to get over it, isn't it?
– I can't do that. Lord Tsuchikage appointed me
as his messenger. You just decided to
come along all on your own. Don't quibble, Akatsuchi. The Land of Water hasn't had
diplomatic ties with anyone. So we've never had
a chance to gather Intel. We may have teamed up now,
but we're still shinobi. Who knows when
the situation will change? Are you the messengers
from the Tsuchikage? Who are you? I'll be taking… your lives! Follow me! Hey, do you know
that we belong… to the Allied Shinobi Force?! Shut up and die, Stone ninja! Who are you?! That's—! Akatsuchi! Hey! Why are the Stone and
Mist fighting here? That's what I want to ask! They just attacked us
out of the blue! Move it, Leaf! You know I can't do that! You're in the way! What? Even if you are from the Leaf,
if you interfere… Please stop! Is that backup? Don't stop me, Chojuro. No. This violates
Lady Mizukage's will. Per her orders… I'll have to make you stop! That's if I can… What? He disappeared. I-Is everyone all right? What?! How can
we be all right? So scary… Why would you
guys attack us? Huh? Hey! This is no time to be arguing! This isn't good! Hey, let's take him. Hey, Leaf underling! Help us! Me? An underling? Naruto's Vow

 W-What?! What do you mean,
"there's no doctor"? I'm very sorry,
this is an isolated island… But there's a Medical Ninja
in my team that's headed this way. They will be arriving shortly. Hey, I brought some towels. I don't need a report.
Just wipe his sweat. You're not very thoughtful
are you, underling? Who're you calling "underling"?! Who else but
a lowly messenger genin would be hanging around
a place like this? Hurry up and get to work. Why me? Damn it! Why'd it turn out like this? Who are they anyway? I just received a message
from Lady Mizukage. Several shinobi have suddenly
dropped out of sight from the village. They oppose
the current shinobi alliance and the central figure among them
is a jonin named Ganryu. Is that the one
who injured Akatsuchi? Yes. He is the sole survivor
of an incident known as
the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass. Yosuga Pass? You're probably aware of
the deep-seated hostility between the Mist and the Stone. That incident is said to
have started the hostility. About ten years ago,
the Hidden Cloud went around collecting jutsu from
each of the Nations. They seized a highly confidential
document from us. On that day,
in a team led by Ganryu, the Hidden Stone, along
with our allies the Mist, set out to recover the document. Stay alert.
The Cloud are just up ahead. No need to worry. We have our allies from
the Stone beyond this point. That may be so, but… If this mission is a success, we will show
the rest of the lands that there is solidarity
between the Stone and Mist. That way, we can get
a little bit closer to peace. Suiren… That's what I wish. I hope it could
be like that some day. W-Why? We are supposed to be allies! Hand it over. Our mission is to return home
with that document. This is absolutely… unforgivable! Kill him. Suiren? I wish I could have seen… peace. Suiren… Junsai… "That way, we can get
a little bit closer to peace," huh. Ganryu… He continues to hate
the Hidden Stone. Perhaps that is why
it was difficult for him to accept this new alliance. Don't tell me
that's why he attacked us. I believe he intends
to get his revenge by assassinating you,
the messengers of the Stone, and by destroying the alliance
which he opposes. As if we'd stand by and
allow such a thing to happen?! Uh, where are you going? I'll get him before he gets me. Please wait! We will settle this matter—! Hey! You guys take care
of Akatsuchi. The world of the ninja
is ruled by hatred. And if I can't find the answer, perhaps I will entrust you
to find it. What's the big idea, underling? I understand you're angry
because your friend was hurt. But don't go. So I should wait quietly
until he comes for me? That's not what I mean! If you go, one of you will die. And it'll be him. That's not it. I can't allow you two… – to fight!
– to fight! What the hell
are you talking about? If you think you can stop me, just try! Damn it!
There's no end to this! We're not going to let you go! Why you—! Not again! We won't let you pass. For an underling, you sure have a nasty jutsu
for stalling people. I'll go and settle this. So go back and
stay with your friend. I don't want to. Don't underestimate me. I have to hurry! One of the messengers
got away from Chojuro and is headed this way? Perfect. This calls for an ambush, Ganryu! No. You guys stay out of this. You can return to the village. What are you saying?! He's right! The Hidden Stone
killed my father! I want to be a part of this! – Me too!
– He's right, Ganryu! Think about those you left behind. Your anger and your hatred… I will take every shred
of those feelings with me! But…! Why do you interfere? I'm Naruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf. The Nine Tails' Jinchuriki? I heard your story. But I came to stop you. My Master was killed by Pain. So I understand
the bitterness you feel. But you have to stop this! I heard you killed Pain
and got your revenge. You're wrong. He just used up all of his power. Are you telling me
you didn't want revenge? Of course not. When he stood before me,
I was consumed with hate. I wanted to kill him so much
that my entire body shook! But I realized that wasn't enough. Why not? Because that just starts
a cycle of hatred. Once it begins, the cycle will
keep going for both sides. Revenge begets revenge. And people dear to us will die,
one after the other. I see. But I'm fully aware
of that already. Then why?! There's no other path to take… in order to make
her wish come true. What are you talking about? If an incident of revenge
occurs here the Five Kage will be forced
to think seriously… about the difficulty and risk
involved in maintaining an alliance. And they'll also be forced
to think about peace. Peace? A village looks out for
its own interests. Villages form alliances, but easily go back on them
to suit their needs. For the sake of their villages,
shinobi have committed betrayals, and fought and killed one another
time and time again. How many shinobi
do you think exist within each of
the Five Great Nations, who harbor hatred towards
shinobi from different lands? This time, I started it. But this kind of occurrence
happens all the time. And not everyone can suppress
their desire for revenge like you. An alliance formed only
by the higher ranks will just end up repeating the past. That's not true. Because I'll change the future! How can you be so sure? My master and my fellow shinobi
have entrusted me to find the answer to
deal with hatred. The answer to
stop this cycle of revenge. The answer to foster
understanding between shinobi! They put their faith in me,
and I'm going to find the answer! So have some faith
in me too, old man! Even it happens gradually, I'll get closer to this thing
called peace! And we will be just
a little bit closer to peace. Suiren… I found you, Ganryu! You… Are you crazy?!
Jumping in front of him like that! Don't worry.
This is nothing. Are you kidding me?
I used full force just now! I can't afford…to die here. I have too much to do still… Hey, is it going to be
my fault if you die?! Is this going to become
an international incident?! You must be kidding me! Don't die! I'm not. I'm just resting
because it hurts. Naruto Uzumaki… I understand. I'll put my trust in you. Stop right there! I'm taking you into custody. If you resist…! I have no intention of resisting. Also please tend to his wounds. Hey, you from the Mist!
What happened to Akatsuchi?! I left a Medical Ninja to treat him. His injuries are
not life-threatening. I see. Ganryu… Here. The messenger you injured
entrusted this to me. This is… He returned the personal effects of
those who died at Yosuga Pass. Along with a formal apology
for that incident. That was the true purpose
of the messengers dispatched by Lord Tsuchikage. The Hidden Stone… apologized for that incident? He did?
That stubborn old man? This was in order to strengthen
the new alliance between the Mist and Stone. I see. What's going to happen
to that guy? He will either be
executed or released. He committed a serious crime. I'm sure he is prepared
to face the consequences. I don't think it will come to that. I got hurt because I made
a wrong turn and stumbled. Right, Kurotsuchi? Are you saying this makes up
for that incident in the past? I'm just going to have the Mist
owe us one. That's all. Maybe the old man wasn't
the only one who had a change of heart
because of the Kazekage. Kazekage? Hey, you Mist!
Remember, you owe us one! Oh, yes. Thank you very much! And you, Leaf underling! Hey, your wound is still… Sorry, but I left
my comrades waiting. See you! The least he could've done
was introduce himself! Hey, what happened to you anyway?! Well, how should I put it? I made a wrong turn
and stumbled. Stumbled? Where? Aoba! Is that all
you're going to say? Never mind already. We have
an early start tomorrow, right? So let's get everything ready,
and then hit the sack. Well, we had a change of plans. We got word that the ship
from the Land of Lightning is coming to pick us up directly. It should be here soon. Oh, there it comes! That's…! It's here! That must be the octopus
coming to guide me.

 All right!

 Will we clash or
be a smash?

 If I dare say,
it will be a no-go, whee!

 I'm a brat-hating outlaw!

 Who's this old man
with the weird rhymes?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Land Ahoy!
Is this the Island of Paradise?"

 This old man's
the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki?

 Tune in again!

 They should be getting there soon. Are you talking about Naruto? Yes. The Raikage wouldn't disclose
the exact location, but he did say it was
the ideal place to lay low. If only Naruto will do as
he's told and stay hidden. Knowing his personality, once he finds out
that war has broken out, he'll want to rush out
onto the battlefield. I told Naruto that he was going on a highly classified
S-rank mission. I'm sure the others will
follow along and play their parts. Octopus, octopus, octopus! Octopus? An octopus is supposed
to help guide me. Remember?
Giant Gramps Sage foretold it. Listen, Naruto… I have seen
a prophecy involving you. You will soon be meeting
an octopus. Where is this octopus?
Can't you give more clues? It's not clear,
but it's an isolated island. People don't go near it. It's like a paradise for creatures. To me, it looks like
it would be a fun resort. And there, the octopus
should be of help to you. In any case,
you will find your way. That's right, it was an octopus. He was right about this being
an isolated island paradise. I'm sure there's no mistake about
meeting someone to guide me. Naruto hasn't figured it out yet. Please start preparing
to disembark soon. Oh, I can see the island! No kidding! An…island paradise? It's like the Hidden Leaf's
Forest of Death. But this is a bit more extreme. This is a resort? Don't worry it's safe. As long as we don't provoke them,
the creatures are quite docile. Except for one… "Except for one" what? What part of this place
is a paradise?! You're a fool,
Giant Gramps Sage! For one that lives
along the shore… Huh? Octopus tentacles! Okay, octopus!
Come and guide me! Naruto, this is actually… a squid! Land Ahoy!
Is this the Island of Paradise?

 It's here! I was just about to warn you
that he's the one you have to be careful about,
but he appeared before I could! – What?!
– What?! One, two, three… It's obvious without
counting its tentacles! Naruto, come on! But we should make sure. A squid has ten legs.
An octopus has eight. If this is the octopus who's going
to help guide me… Naruto?! Squid go deviate…
The rest I abbreviate! What the—?! Here comes another one
saying weird puns! This is so confusing! 6, 7, 8… It's an octopus! This one is an octopus! Is that really an octopus? Master Killer Bee! Killer Bee? Then this octopus is… Y'all are late, ya fools, ya fools! It changed into a human? Hey, ya know Octopops, thanks! Ya know… RHYME NOTEBOOK What? KILLER BEE
THAT'S ME…YA KNOW! Will we clash or be a smash? If I dare say,
it'll be a no-go, whee! I'm a brat-hatin' outlaw… What's up with
this beefy guy in shades, singing lame puns at
the top of his lungs? Is this geezer the octopus
who's going to guide me? They're not puns. It's his original style, a combination of Enka singing
to a rap beat. Enka Rap! Enka rap? Welcome, everyone!
I've been waiting for you. I am Supervisor Motoi
and I'll take care of your needs. I'll take you to your lodgings, so please follow me. Oh, we're finally here? We're standing on
solid ground, Guy. Get a hold of yourself! Is Bushier Brow Sensei all right? He never got over
his seasickness, did he? We were at sea for a long time. It sure was long.
It sure was painful. Is this really a paradise? I still feel woozy. Hey, King, no need to panic! These guys are okay. It's a gorilla! A gorilla! Is this a gorilla? Master Bee stands at the top
of this island's hierarchy of beasts. He's tamed them all. So as long as he is around,
it's safe here. Furthermore, preeminent
Hidden Cloud shinobi maintain a barrier around
the island. We'll know immediately if
anyone suspicious approaches. Which is why this place
was chosen to detain them. Who the heck is that
shades-wearing pops? He is the Hidden Cloud's hero
among heroes. Hero? He's someone who not only
tamed these wild animals, he is a Jinchuriki
who can control Tailed Beasts. He is a Jinchuriki like you…
of Eight Tails. The Eight Tails' Jinchuriki? And he can control it? That old guy? He's Master Killer Bee. Yo! This island is also
where he trained to gain control over the Eight Tails. The Hidden Leaf can use this floor. There are ample rooms. Eat all you want in the great dining hall
on the first floor. Choose whatever rooms you want. We'll adjourn until the meeting
tomorrow morning at seven. I'm going to rest for awhile. This island is also
where he trained to gain control over
the Eight Tails. And there, the octopus should be
of help to you. Ahh, it's the "ya know" brat. What's up? You want an autograph from me? Train me! Train you? I'm the Jinchuriki of the Nine Tails. But I can't control it yet. So please teach me
how to control a Tailed Beast. No way. I came here because
my brother, the Raikage, ordered me to take a vacation… Why should I give up
a rare vacation for that reason? Ya fool, ya fool! Because we're both Jinchuriki! Why won't you help me out? Your big attitude is suspect. And now you're trying
to change the subject. Whee. Old man, your shades are so hip. And your facial features are so thick,
but you're just so sick. Whee! Hey kid, you've got good style. Yes! He's starting to like me! Yo! First comes the greeting! We start with fist bumps,
while we keep rapping. Hey fuddy-duddy… Those shades sure look funny, ah… Shouldn't have said that! Oh well, what the heck! Harem Jutsu! I've been begging for
so long on my knees. Come on, my dear. Teach me control. Please… How's that? All men fall for this jutsu! Hey old man! Old man! You're stingy! What's with that guy?! All he does is talk in rhymes. Whoever heard of
an octopus that raps?! What do you want? Show me how the old man
wearing shades trained to control the Eight Tails. He trained here, right? Oh, you're talking about Bee. He won't give me the time of day,
so I came to ask you instead! Me? I don't care if he's the hero
of the Hidden Cloud or what… He's stingy and stubborn,
and talks only in rhymes. We're both Jinchuriki, so why can't he be
more understanding? – I mean…
– What do you know about Bee?! If you keep complaining about him, I won't forgive you, kid! If you're a Jinchuriki, you can imagine the kind of life
he's had to lead, can't you? I sure can! And that old man should be able
to imagine what it's like for me! So why won't he give me
a break when I need his help? Even I… Bee has been watching
you all along. There's a reason for his actions. Did you introduce yourself to Bee? Introduce? First comes the greeting. We start with fist bumps. We did…fist bumps. Okay. Naruto, right? Follow me. I'll take you to
Bee's training spot. All right! Then I'll join you. Captain Yamato?! I'm a Wood-Style user
and if something happens, I'm supposed to look after him. Oh? You're the Wood Style user. Fine then. Here's some water. Oh, thanks. Still not feeling good? Well, I feel like I'm recovering. But I can't shake the feeling
that I'm still at sea. Could it just be my imagination? Yes. It's just your imagination. Is this the place? Yeah. This spot is known
as the Waterfall of Truth. The Waterfall of Truth? He learned to control
the Tailed Beast here? No, it's the first step. Sit here and close your eyes, Naruto. You will see your true self. My true self? Yes. Why? Why didn't you give them
your autograph at Ichiraku? What? Those guys suddenly got nice and tried to get friendly
with you, huh? They were disgusting, weren't they? This guy looks just like me! Everyone in the village used
to treat us like lepers. Oh hey! Give me
your autograph, Naruto! And address it to my kid.
He's a big fan of yours. Autograph? The hero of the Hidden Leaf… The youth who created
a miracle, Naruto Uzumaki. Can I have one too?
What is it? You refuse? Oh no, but I'm not used
to that sort of thing. I don't even have a signature. Who are you? Can't you tell? I'm you. I don't remember doing
Shadow Clones. I'm the real you. The real you that exists
deep inside your heart. What are you saying?! I don't know you.
Stop making stuff up! Naruto, hey… Quiet! This place is called
the Waterfall of Truth, right? I never figured I'd be able
to come out like this. What a great place. Anyway, I'm your true self. The real you. The real me? Yeah. I'm the precious hatred
inside you. The dark part of you! The only difference is… the Nine Tails has taken
a real liking to me. You… The Nine Tails' will is
a mass of hatred that binds itself tightly to chakra. No matter how hard you
try to shield yourself, it will find some hatred that
you have buried deep inside and try to take you over. Until now, the Nine Tails
and this guy… You got that right. I'm the real one.
You can't kick me out, you fake! Is that how it is? You're the fake one! Come on anytime. On this island, I'm top dog. Taking y'all down
Like a whirlwind clearing the fog. You still have a ways
to go, Kintoki. Hey Bee… If you had time to play around, why couldn't you have taken
a look at the Nine Tails' kid? You're both Jinchuriki,
why not give him a break? I don't like Nine Tails myself,
but that kid has promise. I was a confused mess back then, but I met you and
look at me now. He sort of reminds me of you. My style is rap
And I say shut yer trap! I ain't acknowledgin' no rap-mockin'
"Ya know" fool Besides, he… Damn it! Our strength is identical. There's no end to fighting him. You can't beat me. Never. Then I'll put my bet on numbers! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What the hell?!
Is that how it is?! Even the numbers of
Shadow Clones are the same! You're pretty smart,
figuring that out. Damn it! Go! Go! What is going on? When you sit before
the waterfall and focus, you are able enter
your subconscious. And the waterfall becomes
the mirror that reflects your true self. It is really a mystical place. Right now, Naruto is battling
his other self. – Rasen…
– …gan! Naruto, are you all right?! What happened? Someone exactly like me appeared. And he… What is it? He was my dark self. We're evenly matched and he keeps attacking with
the same strength as me. Our jutsu, our fighting style,
everything is identical. It's an endless battle! How can that be? You must defeat him or you will not be able to control
the Tailed Beast's power. I told you. The Waterfall of Truth
is just the first step. Bee and I used to
be friends.

 Well then,
can you ask the Octopops

 for training hints on
my behalf, Motoi?

 I can't do that.

 Why not?

 I am not worthy of
such an errand.

 I once tried to…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Killer Bee and Motoi"

 I wonder what happened
between these two?

 Tune in again!

 How am I supposed to
beat that guy? Well that, I do not know. Octopops trained here too, right? I can ask him… No, he won't tell me. Not with that attitude. Probably not. I wonder if Octopops had
a dark half too? Hey, Mr. Motoi… Can you tell me
more about Octopops? Like how he grew up,
and his personality. Maybe I can get some hints from that. Maybe I can figure out
the difference between us. If you're a Jinchuriki, you can imagine the kind of life
he's had to lead, can't you?! I sure can! And that dude should be able
to imagine what it's like for me! I don't like talking about other people. But Naruto, you're a Jinchuriki
just like Master Bee. Being able to control the Nine Tails
has a direct effect on world peace. I'll do it. Thank you! I told you earlier… Since you're also a Jinchuriki, you can imagine
the kind of life he's had. And it's just as you
would imagine… Formidable power breeds
fear and antagonism. Bee has always been shunned and considered a nuisance
by the villagers. But he never got depressed
or complained even once. He was always cheerful… always trying to work
the people around him. More than anything, instead of being ashamed
that he was a Jinchuriki, he didn't hide that fact. To me, he seemed to
take pride in himself. Yo. The reason why he was able to
take pride in being a Jinchuriki… was probably because of
his older brother, the Raikage. From days past,
in order to prevent betrayal, Jinchuriki have commonly been
selected from close blood relations of the Five Kage like siblings,
or even spouses. A Jinchuriki is a power used
to protect the Kage, the head of the village. It is also a symbol of
the Kage's strength. I think Master Bee tried to be
a fine Jinchuriki for Lord Raikage's sake. It's said that he mastered
his training at the Waterfall of Truth in no time. I deeply respect
the kind of person Master Bee is. I consider him to be one of
the heroes of the Hidden Cloud. Such a well-loved Jinchuriki. Master Bee must be quite a person.
And you too. I know! Can you ask the Octopops for
training hints on my behalf, Motoi? I can't do that. Why not?! I have no right to request
such a thing. I once tried to kill Master Bee! Killer Bee and Motoi

 Why?! You just said
you respected Octopops. You seem to have a reason. So what is it? This is a confession. You're a Jinchuriki like Bee, so I think it's okay to tell you
about that incident. Incident? This took place 30 years ago… Back then, the Jinchuriki's power
was not strong enough to completely control the Eight Tails. The Eight Tails often went
on a rampage and wreaked havoc
on the Hidden Cloud. Every time that happened, the Third Raikage,
the Kage at that time, and his elite staff would
stop the Eight Tails. Listen! I want you to stop
the Eight Tails' movements. While you're doing that, I will imprison him in
a Sealing Urn. Understood. Okay, get to it. Damn it! The chain forged
from the Sealing Jutsu… Don't give up! If we give up, Hidden Cloud Village
will be destroyed. All right, this should… Now! Pin him down! Don't mess with me,
lowly humans! They were somehow able to suppress
the Eight Tails' rampages and shove him back into
the Sealing Urn. But there were fatalities each time. However, despite the risk, it was crucial to control
the Eight Tails in order to preserve
the power balance between nations. Experiments continued
with the Jinchuriki. Among the many who died or
were injured… was my father. Master Bee killed your father. That's why… No, that wasn't it. Master Bee and I
used to be friends. We were only five years old
when my father died. Bee, you did it! The Jinchuriki that killed
my father died when the Eight Tails was
extracted and sealed. It was the previous Kage's
Jinchuriki. Right after that, Master Bee was chosen to be
the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki. So why did you try to kill Bee? There is no way to control
the Eight Tails. There would be many more victims. That's what I thought. My hatred towards
the Eight Tails grew. I was just a kid, but I kept thinking
about getting revenge. Master Bee was always laughing. I started hating him
more and more because it seemed like
he didn't care. My hatred of the Eight Tails shifted to Master Bee,
his Jinchuriki. I thought if I killed Master Bee,
the Eight Tails would also die. I attacked Master Bee from behind. But I failed and
ran away scared. My face was masked, but Master Bee might
have guessed it was me. After that, I stopped talking
to Master Bee. Even after all that, how did you come to
respect Master Bee? My hatred didn't
disappear overnight. For a long time, I continued to stalk Master Bee
and kept an eye on him. But I wasn't the only one. Master Bee was shunned
by the villagers and despised. All the time. Get lost! You're disgusting! Even though he was forced to become
a Jinchuriki because of politics, in order to protect the village, people still ostracized him. Oh yeah? Yo yo yo, check it out, yo!
Hey, yo yo, hey c'mon, yo yo!! Check it out, yo!
Yo, hey, yo yo! Anyone else would have gone insane. And for the first time… I realized that
Master Bee's suffering was even greater than mine. Why did you tell us? Truth be told, I'd rather have
Master Bee hear this, but I think I'm telling Naruto
because he is a fellow Jinchuriki. I know that I owe it to Bee to
tell him the truth some day. Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a confession. How convenient for him. Naruto, where are you going? I need to be alone for a while! It's that boy… Remember, stay away from him! Go away! I believed in you!
You're a hero, Naruto! Thank you, Naruto! To them, I am now a relic of the past
that is difficult to get rid of. Gaara is the Kazekage,
you know. Don't be so disrespectful! You're nothing but subordinates! Gaara is reserved, cool, strong,
handsome, an elite, and… Octopops has earned so much trust. And Gaara has become
the Kazekage, working for the sake of his village
and gaining acceptance. And me, I have Iruka Sensei
and my comrades and… Why didn't you give them
your autograph at Ichiraku? They changed
their attitude pretty quick and tried to get friendly
with you, huh? They were disgusting, weren't they? Who are you? The villager treated us
like outcasts, but now… I am the real you that exists
deep inside your heart. I am the real you. The real me. I never even gave it a thought. But somewhere deep inside,
I'm still… It's true. I'm still not confident that I have
everyone's trust in the village. Where did Naruto go? Don't tell me… The location of this island
is top secret. There's no way an enemy would… That was old man Motoi. Damn it! Old man Motoi ! Naruto! We're going to go
with Formation C! Why… Why? Naruto! What are you doing?! Stop, Octopops! Old man Motoi really trusts you! It's a squid! That's not an octopus!
It's a squid! A squid? What? It's not an octopus? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… You don't even have to count. An octopus is round!
A squid is triangular! What? I thought Motoi told
the truth to Octopops and he got mad at him. We got worried and
went to look for you, but this thing started
attacking us. Let's see, this is the squid
that attacked us earlier! Naruto! Save the talking for later! Let's do this! Gotcha! Wood Style! Silent Strangle Jutsu! Old man Motoi! We're coming to get you! I'll tell you how I feel… I'm gonna save you for real. That's my deal… That's my spiel. Eight Tails and me
retake the stage! Knocking the beat-up squid
right off the page! The rest, I won't engage. Octopops! Bee, why did you save me? Master Bee, you knew, didn't you? That I tried to… kill you. And yet… Did that happen? What I remember is… Me and Motoi… Me and Motoi. The times I spent
with Motoi, together… We trained hard like
birds of a feather, We made mistakes
but it was no disaster… The two of us always exploding
into laughter. The two of us laughing,
best friends forever… The times I spent
with Motoi, together. Yay! From this moment,
I shall be your instructor

 You better prepare yourself,

 or else you may suffer
death or torture.

 It's finally time
to start training!

 This is a sacred place where
those selected as Jinchuriki

 have long come to undergo
purification ceremonies.

 You'll fight the Nine Tails here,
fool, ya fool!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Next Challenge!
Naruto vs. The Nine Tails"

 Hey Nine Tails…
Evil glare as usual.

 Tune in again!

 Hey, Nine Tails' brat,
thanks for trying to save Motoi. Sure. Naruto has the ability to
bring people together. Just like Bee. Yes! I totally agree! I think I need to
reconsider ya mate. You're quite a good guy,
real top rate. Octopops,
ya got the best rap… I'm so happy to know ya,
I'm one lucky chap! It's great that Naruto and
Bee share similar traits. But frankly, I wish he'd stop
copying his rapping. Yo! Keep the beat. What do you know about Bee? If you keep complaining about him,
I won't forgive you, kid! Motoi trusts Octopops. Did that happen? And Octopops trusts Motoi. Yo! I'm Naruto, ya know! All right, it's decided! Man, it's "ya know, ya know"
all the time. Shuddup, ya know! Go to the Waterfall of Truth. You'll pass with flying colors now. The Next Challenge!
Naruto vs. Nine Tails!

 So have you come back because you
haven't learned your lesson yet? It's going to be the same,
no matter how many times you try. You cannot beat me. I know. Trying to defeat you
with force isn't going to work. Because we use
the exact same moves. You won't be able to
chase me out either. I know you better than anyone else. Then… You already know… What do you want to say? What I decided earlier. I don't remember. Don't act like you don't know. Well, never mind. This place is supposed to show
the truth in your heart, so I'll concentrate on the image
and show it directly to you. HOKAGE CANDIDATE #1 NARUTO This is my autograph. Why you! Oh hey! Give me
your autograph, Naruto! Could you make it out to my kid?
He's a big fan of yours. An autograph? The hero of the Hidden Leaf. The youth who created a miracle,
Naruto Uzumaki. Give me your autograph too! What is it? You refuse? Oh no, but I'm not used to
that sort of thing. I don't have a clue
what to sign. Back at Ichiraku, I couldn't give
them their autographs. Here it is now. Who cares if you have it now? What a joke! Everyone in the village is
just sweet-talking you. They don't mean it. They've been lying to us
the whole time. Making up rules and
treating us like outcasts! Don't you remember? It was so hard and painful. I'm the only one who will
ever understand you! Don't trust anyone
from the village! Yeah… The villagers are important, but there's someone else
I have to trust first. I have to believe in myself. I need to trust the me that
the villagers believe in. Why? After all that
they put us through? Octopops made me
realize something. He doesn't doubt himself at all.
He has pride in himself. Do you… Do you consider me a burden? Just what am I to you? Because you existed,
I became strong. Thanks to you,
I've made it this far. And? And what am I… And what am I
supposed to do now? That's simple. You just become me. Since you are me. Thanks for everything until today. But it's going to be all right now. It seems… …it all went well? It's too soon to celebrate,
fool, ya fool. Shall we try to control
the Nine Tails' power now? From this moment,
I'll be your instructor Ya better prepare yourself or else
you'll suffer death n' torture. All right! Come with me, Naruto! Um, may I come along? Okay! What about Motoi? I have to report in to the Hidden Cloud
at regular intervals, so I'll take my leave here. Thank you for your help. Things won't be easy
from here on out. So there was something on
the other side of the waterfall. Wow! You'll fight the Nine Tails here! Fight the Nine Tails? That's right, fool, ya fool. This is amazing. Follow me. These ruins seem to
be quite old. They must have
archeological importance, they should be restored. No! Those stone statues were carved
without heads to begin with. There's a reason for it. How am I supposed to
fight the Nine Tails here? What's more, how am I
supposed to face him? I hope you're not going to
do anything excessive! Do you think it's something
that can be controlled without doing
something excessive? Fool, ya fool. Since long ago,
this has been a sacred place where those selected as
Jinchuriki have come to undergo
the Purification Ceremony. It's set up here so you can talk to
your Tailed Beast in a special way. It's right inside this building.
You hear what I say? This is… Only the chosen ones can enter…
To be selected. Go and stick your head
into the statue's mouth… Like a good man, respected. If there isn't any darkness
in your heart, the door will open… Fully extended. Hey, can you explain it normally? I don't quite understand. No darkness in the heart? I see, so that's why
at the waterfall… However… If there's even a little darkness
in your heart, the gate will not part. Do you consent? And the statue will bite off
your head and tear you apart. Are you content? All the headless statues
you saw on your way here… are past Jinchuriki who weren't…
sincere! I'm your true self. The real you. This is too risky. Naruto, use a Shadow Clone. This is a sacred place,
fool, ya fool. Generations of Hidden Cloud
ancestors guard and protect this place. Tricks like that won't work! But… Captain Yamato… I came here to learn how
to control the Nine Tails' power! This is important to me.
I can't run away! I'm going to believe in myself! Naruto! No! How could this happen! Naruto! You… Just kidding! There's just a switch in there. It's a habit.
I couldn't help myself. I did the same thing too.
Out of habit. Those stone statues are
just broken. It's just some wit. I thought you said this place
was sacred! Fools, ya fools! This is…? Go inside,
close your eyes and focus. Just like at the waterfall.
Then you'll meet your Tailed Beast. Before when I was training, I was able to meet
the Nine Tails in my mind. Any Jinchuriki can do that. But this is
a little different, okay? Listen to me very carefully. I'll give you an explanation. Naruto, what kind of Sealing Jutsu
was used on your Nine Tails? Please answer my question. It's a Tetragram Seal. A Tetragram Seal, huh.
That's impressive. It's even more solid than
my Steel Shell Seal. Do you have the key? I have no choice but to do
as you say, Great Lord Elder. What is this? It is the key left by
the Fourth Hokage that locks and unlocks
the sealing jutsu on your belly! Yes! You're going to undo
the seal, after all. What if he can't
control it properly? What if the Nine Tails
revives completely? We'll seal him away here. That's what this place
is for as well. Until we get a new Jinchuriki,
this is where we'll seal him in. You got a problem with this?
No booin'. – But…
– That won't happen! Because I'm going to do this. Okay! I'm going to shut the door. And I'll show you how to deal
with the Nine Tails! Naruto, you really do impress me. The rules are simple,
as you'll soon see. Greet the Nine Tails in
your subconscious mind, then undo the seal. Hey, evil glare as usual. Naruto… You… What is it? Where'd the real you go? I don't sense him. I'm here…right in front of you! You conquered hatred. But don't relax,
do the best you can! The Nine Tails is
a mass of true hatred. That's absolutely true, man! What're you up to? Can't you see my mouth is full? Here I go… When the Nine Tails emerges
from the seal, grab the Nine Tails' chakra
with your own chakra, and pull it away! Chakra can only be caught
with chakra. It's common sense, son. Take the Nine Tails' chakra
away from him… and you'll be number one. Touch the Nine Tails directly and stick your chakra onto its chakra,
and it'll pull each other. In other words, it's going to be
like a match of tug-of-war. Okay?! I'll help you in your fight. But unfortunately inside
your head I got no might. He's strong! Just a word of warning. When you're trying to
take his chakra, there's the risk that
he'll pull away yours. I don't need to explain what'll
happen if all your chakra is pulled away and
you have zero left, right? I see. You intend to
control my power. So you teamed up
with Eight Tails? You, the Jinchuriki of
the Nine Tails? That's pitiful! The risks are high for sure. But if you take it away, the Nine Tails' chakra will
be yours forever! Grab whatever chakra you can
from the Nine Tails' will… That will be your payoff! Don't get caught in
the Nine Tail's hatred. Use your strong will. That's how you'll ward him off! Don't underestimate me ! Thank you, Octopops! I managed to contain the explosion! Naruto, that will be the last of
my cooperation to your operation! Thanks! I'm sitting still
just as I thought. Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan! Damn it. The Nine Tails
is no joke.

 If it weren't for him…
I hate him.

 What?

 Don't give in Naruto!
Fool, ya fool!

 No one will ever respect
someone like you!

 What is this?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Orange Spark"

 Who are you?

 Tune in again!

 Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan! So fast! Do you think you can beat me? Why would I break
the seal otherwise? Besides… We gotcha! Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! Do it now! You…bastard! He's weakening!
Now's my chance. Hatred… Suffering… I want to kill… Help! I hate all this! It's not going to work anyway. I'll get revenge! What is this? This is bad! Don't give in, Naruto!
Fool, ya fool! You cannot control my power! You are just a small portion
of my hatred! Is he the one? Get lost! No one will ever respect
someone like you! Get lost! Get lost! Get lost! Get lost! Just go away! Shut up! Nine Tails' hatred is greater
than I imagined. This could get bad for real.
This is quite an ordeal! I'll stop him. Go away and disappear! It's all right,
you can stay right here. Naruto… The Orange Spark


 The Orange Spark


Naruto… What? What are you doing here? And how come you know
my name? Oh yes, that's right. Well then, Naruto,
can you guess who I am? No way… Have you figured it out? You're Nine Tails' real form! That's such a crude laugh! You trying to fool me by disguising yourself
as a woman, Nine Tails? You got it wrong, ya know! Ouch! Huh? "Ya know"? I couldn't stop myself
from hitting you. I was born impatient,
and I talk fast, so I use some weird phrases. I try to control it,
but it slips out when I get excited. What about you? I hope you didn't get any of
my bad speech patterns. Then… Minato, didn't say anything to you? Shame on him. Yes… I'm… I've wanted… I've wanted to meet you
for so long, Ma…ya know? "Ya know," huh? You really are my child. The Nine Tails transformation stopped. Did you do something, Yamato? No, it seems to have
stopped on its own. What happened? There's a ton of stuff I wanted to ask you
when I met you! Sure, you can ask me anything. But first, we have to tame
the Nine Tails. This chakra… Kushina, is that you? Minato imbedded my chakra
into the seal formula, so that when the time came
for you to take control of the Nine Tails' power,
I could be of help. Are you listening? I'm glad that
you're so beautiful, Ma! Well, thank you! Your hair is just like your father's, but I'm sorry you inherited
my looks, Naruto. Why? If I got my pretty mom's looks, that makes me handsome, right? And you have nice,
straight red hair. I wish my hair were like that too! You're the second man to
compliment my red hair. Really? Who was the first? Who else? Your father. Oh! That's right! What is it? Hey, hey! I always wanted to ask you
one thing if I ever met you! How did you and Dad
fall in love? What an embarrassing thing
to ask, ya know! Hey! You said, "ya know!" You're excited! In this case, it's more like
shaken up, ya know! Hey, you said it again! Let's see… It was the first day I came
to the Hidden Leaf Village… That's when I first met
your father, Minato. All right. We have
a new transfer student today who will be attending our Academy. I'm Kushina Uzumaki, ya know! Oh! Look at the color of her hair. How can anyone have
hair like that? How do you get it that red? Her hair's really weird! – I wouldn't go out with hair like that.
– Hey! Be quiet! Settle down! I'm… I'm going to become
the village's first female Hokage! I want to become a great Hokage who will be admired by everyone
 in the village too! A Hokage who is admired
by everyone in the village, huh. Back then, he wasn't very manly
and didn't look too dependable. So I didn't take Minato seriously or believe for a minute that
he could become a Hokage. Why not? Dad looked so strong. You're right. But back then,
I was young and very ignorant. But I sure was arrogant,
having moved from another village and announcing that I was going
to become the Hokage. After that, I started getting
teased by the boys. They nicknamed me… Tomato! From today, we're going
to call you Tomato! You have a fat, round face
with red hair. Just like a tomato! As if a tomato can become
 the Hokage! I hate tomatoes! Me too! I never eat it in my salad! A tomato that everyone hates could never be accepted
as the Hokage! So that's it! I'll bet it was Dad who
protected you from those bullies! No, you're dead wrong! Tomato… I grudgingly accepted being
called that name. It was embarrassing,
but it fit me perfectly. You're getting redder and riper! It's the Tomato Festival!
It's time to harvest! Who're you calling Tomato? Now you listen…
I hate tomatoes too, ya know! Keep calling me Tomato and you're going to get it,
ya know! What are you laughing at? I always beat those bullies
at their own game and turned them into
smashed tomatoes. The girl with the long red hair
who beat the boys half to death. As expected,
I was stuck with a new nickname… The Red-Hot Habanero! Kiba and Shikamaru were
always saying that mothers are really scary. Always fighting. Naturally, I always won these fights
as the Red-Hot Habanero. But… Are you the one who's always
making my kid brother cry? That's because he's always
messing with me, ya know! And he‘s such a wimp! I'm a genin! Cool, huh? I have to teach anyone who bullies
my kid brother a lesson. A real kunai? You can't even recognize
a Substitution Jutsu? You're still just a kid! Your hair's so red…
and it's stiff like thread. Hair like this is ugly! Serves you right! I… I don't like my hair either! But… Even with hair like this,
I'm still me! What choice do I have? It's the Red-Hot Habanero! Outsider! As if an outsider can become
the Hokage! You're not going to help me
because I'm an outsider? I… I bet you agree with them too! It's because I don't want
to be an outsider… It's because I want this village
to be my home… That's the only reason
why I said that. Who would want to become
the Hokage anyway?! I used to hate my hair. But a certain incident changed
the way I felt about my red hair. A certain incident? I'm home! I'm home. Is… Is anyone home? Someone! Help me! I have a special kind of chakra. Because of that,
the Hidden Cloud kidnapped me. Hey! At that time, in order to
leave a trail behind as I was being taken away, I cut off pieces of my hair
and dropped it… without the enemy knowing. But since I was an outsider, I didn't hold out hope that
anyone would come to rescue me. We had come to the edge
of the border and I thought it was all over… Are you hurt? I came to save you. You'll be all right now. Hey, wait a minute! That's… Your hair is beautiful.
So I noticed it right away. But you've always ignored me. Because I know that
you're strong, in body and in spirit. But this is a fight between
two villages. It's different from
your other fights, so… So? I didn't want to lose you. Even if I'm an outsider? Why do you say that? You live in Hidden Leaf Village,
so you're one of us. At that moment, Minato was a great ninja
in my eyes. He was the man of my dreams. He changed me. This red hair that I used to hate brought me
the man of my destiny. And it became
the "red thread of fate." After that, I learned to
love my hair. And… I fell in love with Minato. Only men who compliment my hair get to hear these precious words
from me. Naruto, will you accept them? Uh-huh! I love you. When you put
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf and Red-Hot Habanero together… You get the Leaf's Orange Hokage! That's cool, ya know! Hokage… Your dream is the continuation
of Minato's and my dream. Yeah, I won't let your dreams down! Naruto… But…before that… Naruto, listen carefully.
We're out of time.

 What do you mean
we're out of time?

 I need to tell you the reason why
Nine Tails was sealed inside you.

 It has to do with an incident
that happened 16 years ago.

 Sixteen years ago?

 That's right. Sixteen years ago
on October 10th…

 The day you were born.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
"Target: Nine Tails"

 Tell me what happened!

 Tune in again!

 Good job, Yamato. No, that wasn't me. Naruto stopped it all by himself. But is it okay to
leave things like this? Right now, Naruto and
Nine Tails are in a confrontation… It better be settled soon. We want it
to meet our hopeful expectations! All this waiting is so drawn out! To pass the time,
why don't we work out? This isn't the time to be rapping! Shuddup! Right now, Naruto is locked in
an internal battle with Nine Tails. We cannot help him any further. If you really care about
Naruto's wellbeing, all we can do now… is to have faith in him and wait. I love you. What is this? I feel so calm… I love you. I feel so happy. Damn you, Kushina! What is this? This is real nice! For now,
keeping watch will suffice! My chakra that's suppressing
the Nine Tails won't last much longer! This is your chance to do it! All right! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! You brat! Just as I thought.
He's really strong! Take this! Rasengan Super Barrage! Don't underestimate me! I can keep going, ya know! Here! That's… Sage Mode! Sage Art! Massive… Rasengan Barrage! One more round! What kind of power is this? Pull! Get out! You did it! You pulled
the Nine Tails' chakra out! This is… This is the Nine Tails'… Naruto… You… You have infuriated me, Naruto! You still have that much power… You really are amazing. This is the Six Paths…?! You watch out, Naruto. I'm sorry…Nine Tails. But I'll make it up to you. So just hang in there
for a little while. You did it, Naruto! Yeah. Ma, where are you going now? I can finally go and join Minato. There's something
I must tell you before I go. Naruto… It's about when you were born
16 years ago. I'll tell you what really happened. What really happened…
16 years ago? I was the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki
before you. Let's start from there. Target: Nine Tails

 You were
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki, Ma? Yes. Before I can tell you
what happened 16 years ago, I need to tell you more
about me. I was chosen as the second
Jinchuriki host of Nine Tails. Truth be told, I was brought here for
the express purpose of being the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki… LAND OF FIRE        LAND OF EDDIES


from the Land of Eddies. Why? Why did they have to choose
someone from another land?! You're right. I'm from
a different land, and village. But the Land of Fire and
the Land of Eddies, as well as Hidden Leaf Village
and Hidden Eddy Village, share a deep bond. The shinobi of the Senju Clan
of the Hidden Leaf and the shinobi of the Uzumaki Clan
of the Hidden Eddy were distant blood relatives. Our people lived long. So the Hidden Eddy Village was
also known as the Village of Longevity. And we specialized in Sealing Jutsu. We were also a rowdy bunch. The Tetragram Seal on
your abdomen is based on a jutsu from our village. And Minato, your father, learned
various Sealing Jutsu from my mother. Naruto, the symbol on your back… That is the symbol
of the Hidden Eddy. Even today in Hidden Leaf Village that symbol is a symbol
of friendship, isn't it? So the Hidden Eddy Village…? It no longer exists. During the era of war, our sealing jutsu abilities
were greatly feared, so the village was targeted
and destroyed. Those who survived feared
for their safety, so they hid their identities and
scattered throughout the region. Still…why were you chosen?! It seems that even
among the Hidden Eddy, I was born with powerful chakra
able to suppress the Nine Tails. Do you know about the battle… between the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju, and Madara Uchiha? Uh-huh… The Jinchuriki before me
was the woman who became the wife of
the First Hokage. Her name was Mito Uzumaki. In order to help Lord First Hokage who had obtained the Nine Tails
in his battle with Madara, Lady Mito sealed the Nine Tails
inside her body with a Sealing Jutsu and
became its Jinchuriki. From then on, the Hidden Leaf maintained
possession of the Nine Tails. But when Lady Mito's days
were coming to an end, I was brought to Hidden Leaf
as the vessel for the Nine Tails. You were just being used! When I was first brought to the village, I wasn't told a thing. It was quite a shock
when I was told why I was there. This was a closely guarded secret. And the only ones who knew were the Third Hokage and
a few of the top officials. Not even the Legendary Sannin
were told about this. I was nearly overwhelmed by
the pressure of being the Jinchuriki and the loneliness I felt. But Lady Mito, the previous Jinchuriki,
summoned me… Come closer. Like you, I was brought here to become the vessel
for the Nine Tails. I can imagine your shock
when you learned of this. How sad you must have been. How you have suffered. You can tell me the truth. Yes… Now listen carefully. Indeed, we are the vessels
for the Nine Tails. However, there is a way
to find happiness even if you must live as a Jinchuriki. First… by filling ourselves. By filling myself with love first, I would be able to
live a happy life despite being
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki. That is what Lady Mito taught me. So you were happy even if
you were the Jinchuriki, Ma? Yes. Naruto… Now why are you crying? Wait… What is it? That time 16 years ago when the Nine Tails attacked
Hidden Leaf Village… Dad said a man wearing
an Akatsuki mask was behind it. So how come you had
the Nine Tails, Mom? I see that your father didn't
tell you all the details. Of course. Back then,
there was so much going on and Minato didn't have much time. It's true. The fact is that,
16 years ago, a masked man was manipulating the Nine Tails that
attacked the village. But moments earlier, I had the Nine Tails sealed
and in my possession. Then why? That masked man. I don't know how,
but that masked man knew… Knew what? He knew about the one chance
he had to weaken the seal, which kept the Tailed Beast
locked inside the Jinchuriki. He waited for that moment
to steal the Nine Tails. The one chance to weaken the seal?! What was it? It was childbirth. During the approximately
ten months from the time a female Jinchuriki gets pregnant
and gives birth, the Tailed Beast Seal
weakens proportionally as the energy normally
used to maintain the seal is diverted to the growing baby. Then… Sixteen years ago…on October 10… HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Congratulations! What? Your due date is October 10! Oh then…yeah! Huh? A baby? I'm going to be a mother, ya know! And I'm going be a father. A mother, ya know! I'm going to be a father! A mother, ya know! Imagine that,
I'm going to be a father! Kushina, there is something
I must explain to you about giving birth. It happened to Lady Mito,
the previous Jinchuriki, too. During her labor,
the Nine Tails' seal was nearly broken. I'm sorry,
but as a precautionary measure, we're going to ask you
to deliver the child somewhere away from the village,
inside a barrier. We have the seal to think of,
so I will be accompanying you. Minato and Taji from
the Anbu Black Ops. Also I will send my wife, Biwako,
to be with you. This is to be done in utmost secrecy. Naturally, I will assign bodyguards, but they will be Anbu Black Ops
under my direct orders. I'll go on ahead and
prepare everything. All right. I will take you there. Kushina! Oh, yes. I appreciate it. We should go soon. Yes. Oh! Oh my… Was it a girl? It's a boy. So cute… What's your name? It's Sasuke. Oh, so he was named after
father of the Third Hokage! Yes, so that he will grow up
to be a strong and fine shinobi. You will be giving birth
soon too, right, Kushina? You should pick a name
in advance. I already have. His name will be Naruto. You'll be classmates, Sasuke,
so be friends, okay? By the way, does it really hurt? So there's actually something
that scares you, Kushina! I'm surprised! Let's go, Kushina! Oh, yes! See you again! The details of your birthing
are supposed to be top secret. Until we get to our location, you must avoid any contact,
even with your friends. Yes, I'm sorry. Also, we are leaving
the village secretly. If your labor pains begin,
try not to cry out loud! Oh…right. It hurts, ya know! BIND

I've never seen Kushina
in so much pain. Is she…all right? She's all right! Never mind that. Just stay focused
on the Nine Tail's seal! But she's… You are the Fourth Hokage!
Act like one! A man would have dropped dead
from such pain long ago. But women are strong! He's so strong! The Nine Tails is struggling
to get out! Hang in there, Kushina! Hang in there, Naruto! I can see his head!
You're almost there, Kushina! Hang on, Kushina! Naruto! Come out quickly! Nine Tails, you stay put! Hot water! Right! Why is Nine Tails—?
Was the seal released?

 Do not falter!

 Even if we can't defeat
the Nine Tails,

 we must concentrate on
evacuating the villagers!

 As Hokage, I will protect the village…
my family…right now.

 This is what I need to do.

 Next Time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Fourth Hokage's Death Match!"

 I won't let you!

 Tune in again!

 He's born! The Fourth Hokage's Death Match!

 I'm a father today! He's a healthy babe. Naruto! Don't touch him! The mother sees him first. Naruto… I finally get to see you. You'll have lots more time later. There, there. How are you feeling, Kushina? Okay. Thank you. Minato… All right! I know you've gone
through childbirth, but I'm going to completely
seal the Nine Tails! Lady Biwako! Taji! Fourth Hokage Minato,
get away from the Jinchuriki. Otherwise, this child's life
will end in one minute. How did he get past
the barrier? This guy… Who the hell is he? Kushina! The Nine Tails Seal is still… Get away from the Jinchuriki. Don't you care
what happens to your kid? Wait! Calm down! Speak for yourself, Minato. I'm as cool as can be. Naruto! Well, I must hand it to
the Yellow Flash. But I wonder about this next one. Minato! Naruto! Thank goodness…
Naruto isn't hurt. I was forced to use
the Flying Raijin Jutsu. His target is Kushina… and he succeeded in separating us. I must hurry. Just what…do you want? I'm going to pull the Nine Tails
out from you and destroy the Hidden Leaf. What? Minato's Teleportation Jutsu
allows him to move instantly between locations marked
with Jutsu Formulas. He made sure to mark
your Sealing Formula with it too… in order to protect you. However, I managed to put
a distance between you. Furthermore, the Nine Tails' Seal
has been weakened from childbirth. Do you know how long
I've waited for this moment? You'll be safe here. Naruto, just wait awhile. I have to go and save your mother. You are… Now then, come out Nine Tails! Good. Now I'll go straight
to Hidden Leaf Village. Hold it. Uzumaki Shinobi are amazing. You don't die right away after
the Tailed Beast is extracted. You were the Jinchuriki
of the Nine Tails. I'll use him to kill you. I must say,
you're as quick as your nickname. But you are too late. Minato… Is Naruto…Is he safe? Yes, he's fine. He's in a safe place for now. Thank goodness. Minato, you must stop that man
and the Nine Tails right now. He's heading for Hidden Leaf Village. He flew off again. Well, never mind. We're heading for
the Hidden Leaf Village. Why? Never mind that. Just stay with Naruto. Naruto… Minato… Thank you. Good luck. FOURTH HOKAGE

 FOURTH HOKAGE

I'll be right back. Oh, another falling star! Did you make a wish this time? Oh, I forgot. What do you mean
you're going out now? Well, the guys are getting together. I have to go out sometimes! "Sometimes"?
It's been every night lately! I'll be sure to come home early. Thank you! Thanks, I'll come again. Hey! Watch where you're walking. Why don't we just do
Rock-Paper-Scissors again tonight? Not that again!
Think of something more exciting! How can you call yourself my rival? We have an early start tomorrow.
So let's pass for tonight. Don't use a mission
as an excuse! I have all this pent-up energy
inside me! Now is the time for diligent training! Honest-to-goodness discipline
and hard work lead to success in future missions! Are you listening to me?! Say Guy… Do you sense anything weird? There's been a chill in the air. It's your attitude that's causing it! We're only young once! What is this feeling? There, there… It's a strange feeling. Of all times for Mom
and Dad to be out. Don't cry, Sasuke. No matter what happens, your big brother will
definitely protect you. It can't be… Summoning Jutsu! – What happened?
– Is it an accident? That's…! N-No way…! The Nine Tails! – Run!
– It's the Nine Tails! – Help!
– We're done for! Go, Nine Tails! Lord Third Hokage! The Nine Tails is…! The Nine Tails has suddenly
appeared in the village! I'm aware of that.
I will suppress it. You and the others protect
the civilians! Yes sir! Was Kushina's seal broken? Despite all the precautions,
did we fail? Biwako… Damn you, Nine Tails! This is the moment
I release my pent-up power! Don't be hasty, Guy! Come on! I'll be your opponent! – Wait!
– Huh? Gather immediately in the guardroom! Why? It's the Third Hokage's orders! Lord Hiruzen? You heard. Let's go, Guy! Now's our chance!
Evacuate the civilians! Are we ready? Yes! Over here, Nine Tails! Over here, Nine Tails! Where are you looking?! Over here. Do not falter! Even if we can't defeat the Nine Tails, we must concentrate on
evacuating the villagers! Do not take action on your own! Assemble before Lord Hiruzen! Carry out the orders! As Hokage, I will protect the village,
my family, right now. This is what I need to do. I won't allow it to do
as it pleases anymore! So you've taken notice of me. You won't get your way here! For this large a scale, I'll have to be careful
where I send it. The jutsu that stopped
the Nine Tails' attack must be the Teleportation Barrier! It's Minato? All right! We're going too! Right! I must report all that's happened
to Lord Third immediately. I'm your opponent…
and it's all over. He flew away. He's fast. Next time, I'll get him faster. The instant we make contact. My attack missed. But he materialized and
instantly tried to drag me in. What is that jutsu? I won't let you get away. He uses the Teleportation Jutsu too? Is that how he took Kushina
and moved away so quickly? A shinobi who outmaneuvered the Anbu
assigned under Lord Third's direct control… who slipped through
a top-secret barrier… and who knew that
the Nine Tails' Seal would weaken during childbirth. Furthermore, he undid
the Nine Tails' Seal, tamed it and… went in and out of the barrier set up by the Hidden Leaf
without being caught. I know of only one shinobi
capable of this. Are you Madara Uchiha? No, that's impossible. He's dead. I wonder about that. At this point,
it doesn't matter who you are. But why are you targeting
the Hidden Leaf? I could say I did it on a whim,
or that I planned it, or that it's war, or that it's for peace. Whatever the case,
he's no ordinary man! He can control the Nine Tails
and his Teleportation Jutsu surpasses both Lord Second's and mine. And he has some
dangerous ideology. I must deal with him now or he'll be even more trouble
than the Nine Tails! If I transport myself to
the village now, he will follow and the battlefield
will become even more chaotic. If he's anything like Madara, I can't keep the Nine Tails under
the Summoning Jutsu for too long. I just have to entrust
the village to Lord Third. As for me… I must take this guy
down right here! Now that I have freed the Nine Tails, you people have no hope left! His flesh… My physical attacks have
no effect on him, but he makes himself materialize
to attack me. Namely, I can only aim for him
when we both strike blows! But his risk lies during
the moment of attack. And considering the time remaining
on the Nine Tails' Summoning Jutsu, he doesn't relish a long battle either. The one who attacks
an instant quicker than the other… will win this match! I win. Damn it! He flew to that
kunai from earlier! That was my Flying Raijin, Level 2. You got me. This is what is meant by "elusive." I should never have let down my guard. Flying Raijin Jutsu! So that's it… He marked my body somewhere! A Contract Seal? He intends to separate
the Nine Tails from me? With this, the Nine Tails
no longer belongs to you! Naruto, our newborn son!

 I wish I could've been with you.

 But our family is shinobi.

 We must sacrifice our lives to
protect what we believe in!

 Don't forget us Naruto.
We love you forever.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Thank You"

 I'm going to seal
the Nine Tails in Naruto!

 Tune in again!

 Thank You

 – Run!
– Help! Iruka, are you all right? Mom! Dad! Mom's…! Why didn't you stay
at the shelter? I'll take care of Mom,
so hurry up and get out of here! No, I won't! I don't want to leave
you and Mom behind and run away! I'll protect Mom! Don't push your luck,
you're still a kid! It's a parent's duty to
protect their children! You must avoid damage
to the village! Chase the Nine Tails
outside the village walls! Yes sir! Buy me time so that
I can execute my jutsu! Do not slow down the attack! Right! Let's go! Ninja Art! Summoning! Appear… Monkey King Enma! The Nine Tails, huh. So the seal was broken? We're going to chase it out of the village
with the Adamantine Nyoi! Got it! Transform! Let's go, Enma! Right! Extend! I've chased it out of the village. Don't let up! Keep at him! Minato… Where are you?! I must hand it to
the Fourth Hokage. You wounded me and managed
to pull out the Nine Tails. However, the Nine Tails will
be mine eventually. I am going to rule the world… And there are so many ways
to go about doing that. That tone…
He's not joking around. Keep him occupied until
the Fourth Hokage arrives! Iruka… Let go of me! My dad and my mom are…
still fighting! BIND Now listen up. You young shinobi are to
stay away from Nine Tails. What do you mean by that? This is not a battle
between villages. This is domestic trouble. There is no reason for you all
to risk your lives. Speak for yourself! Calm down, Kurenai! You're a shinobi too. We are not guaranteed
a long life. But, my daughter… At least, pass on the Will of Fire
to my grandchild. Make that your oath to your father. For I do believe in you. This is terrible. He's going to do that again? Lord Third! Summoning Jutsu! This is… It's the Fourth Hokage! I will rule the world. Kushina, forgive me. Hold down the Nine Tails
for just a while! That's going to be tough…
even for me! In order to transport
something this big, I'll need just as much chakra! Minato… Did he fly off with the Nine Tails? That way! I must put up a barrier immediately. My chakra is almost… I can still do it, Minato. Kushina! Did I wake you up? I'm sorry, Naruto. Kushina… I'm going to draw the Nine Tails
with me to my death. So we can delay the revival
of the Nine Tails. I'll be able to save all of you with what little chakra
I have left. Thank you for everything
you've done for me. FOURTH HOKAGE


Kushina… FOURTH HOKAGE

It's because of you that
I'm the Fourth Hokage! You made me a man! And you made me
this baby's father! And yet… Minato, don't give me that look! I'm happy that you loved me. And today…is this child's birthday. If I were to imagine me alive,
and our future together, the three of us as a family… I can't see us having
anything but a happy life. If I were allowed just one regret, it's that I won't be able
to see Naruto grow up. How I wish I could have seen that. Kushina, there is no need for you
to die with the Nine Tails. Preserve what little chakra
you have left for a reunion with Naruto. I'll seal all of your remaining chakra
inside Naruto. It will be part of
an Eight Signed Seal. Then I'll take the Nine Tails
with me with the only Sealing Jutsu I can do
since I'm not a Jinchuriki, the Reaper Death Seal! But the caster that uses that jutsu…! And one more thing. I will only seal half
of the Nine Tails. Sealing a power this immense
is physically impossible. It's also strategically unwise. If you take the Nine Tails and
its seal with you when you die, there won't be a Jinchuriki around
when he reemerges. That will upset the balance of power
between the Tailed Beasts. The Reaper Death Seal will seal
half of the Nine Tails with me forever. As for the other half
of the Nine Tails… Perhaps you are
the Child of Prophecy. What is it? Sometime in the future, the Shinobi World will face
a grave crisis. The savior that will emerge
during this time is the Child of Prophecy. I will seal it inside Naruto with
the Eight Signed Seal! I know what you want to say. But remember what Master Jiraiya
said about world upheaval. And the calamities that would follow. Two things were confirmed
for me today. That masked man
who attacked you today is a harbinger of disaster! And the one who will
stop him is this child! This infant whose godfather
is Master Jiraiya. He will open up the future
as a Jinchuriki. I don't know why,
but I'm convinced of this. But Minato…! Reaper Death Seal! Let's put our trust in this child! He's our son, after all! Those signs. Don't tell me…! Yes, it's the Reaper Death Seal. When I'm finished with
the Reaper Death Seal, I will seal your chakra
inside Naruto. When he tries to control
the Nine Tail's power as a Jinchuriki, I want you to help him out. Our son… He's our son, which is why I don't want to
put such a terrible burden on him! And also, why use
the Reaper Death Seal? If it's just so I can meet
a grown-up Naruto even if it's just for a short while, there's no need for you to die! I want you to stay by Naruto as
he grows up and protect him. I don't get it! To keep the balance
of Tailed Beasts? For the sake of the nation
and the village? Why must Naruto be sacrificed?! Why must you sacrifice
yourself for me?! To forsake one's nation,
and one's village, is the same as forsaking one's child. Your own homeland was destroyed,
so you of all people should know… the harsh life that awaits
those without a country. Besides, our family is… shinobi! And finally, even if I were to live,
I'm no match to you. Even though you won't have
much time with him, there are some things only you
as his mother can tell Naruto. Things that I can't. That's a mother's role. I'm not doing this just for you.
I'm doing this for Naruto. I will gladly die for my son. It's my duty as his father. Lord Third, what's wrong?! It's no good. I can't go further than
this point because of the barrier put up to
keep Nine Tails from escaping! Those two are planning to take care
of Nine Tails themselves! Damn you, Fourth Hokage! Seal! My body is getting numb… I never expected
such massive chakra… Damn you! It's the Reaper Death Seal,
after all. He actually used it. But the Nine Tails is still…! Wasn't he able to
complete the seal? It's gotten smaller, but… All right,
next is the Eight Signed Seal. I will seal the Nine Tails
inside Naruto. The Ritual Altar? Does he intend to seal me again? Furthermore…
Inside that baby? Kushina! Are you all right? Right now! I said that this was
the father's duty. Then all the more,
since I'm his mother! There's a child? They shielded him. Why you—! This is the first time
I lost an argument. Okay, I understand that
you're determined to do this. Thank you, Kushina. Summoning Jutsu! Nine Tails! What?! Lord Fourth too!
What's the meaning of this?! Gerotora, I'm going to give you
the Sealing Formula's key. Take it immediately to Master Jiraiya
and store it away. I see… Minato plans to make
his own son the Jinchuriki to save the village. You have my world. I confirm the key
is in my possession. And now, I'm off! That should do it. Kushina, my time is running out. I'm going start
the Eight Signed Seal. I want to put some of
my chakra in Naruto too. It'll be quite a while
before we can see him. Let's tell him what
we want to say. Naruto… Don't be picky.
Eat lots and grow strong. Make sure you bathe every day
and stay warm. Also don't stay up late.
You need lots of sleep. And make friends. You don't need a lot of friends. Just a few…
Ones you can really, really trust. I wasn't very good at it, but keep up with your studies
and practice your ninjutsu hard. Remember that everyone has
strengths and weaknesses. So don't get too depressed if
you can't do something well. Respect your teachers and
upperclassmen at the Academy. Oh, and this is important. It's about the Three Prohibitions
for a shinobi. Be extra careful about lending
and borrowing money. Put your mission wages into
your savings account. No alcohol until you're twenty. Too much can ruin your health,
so drink in moderation. Another Prohibition is women. I'm a woman, so I don't know
too much about this but… All you need to remember is that this world is made up
of men and women. So it's only natural to take
an interest in girls… But just don't get hooked
on bad women. Find someone just like me. Speaking of the Three Prohibitions,
be wary of Jiraiya Sensei, you know. Naruto, from now on, you're going to face
lots of pain and hardship. Be true to yourself. Have a dream and have the confidence to make
that dream come true! There's so much… Oh, so much more that
I want to pass on to you. I wish I could stay with you longer. I love you. Minato, I'm sorry I used up
your time. Oh, it's okay. Naruto, my message to you is… I guess it's the same as
your nagging mother's. Eight Signed Seal. I'm sorry for making you
the Nine Tail's vessel. For putting our burden
on your shoulders… For not being able
to live by your side… For not being able to
shower you with love. You don't have to apologize. It was rough in the past
because I was a Jinchuriki. But I never held it
against you or Dad. I admit I didn't really know
what parental love was. After all,
you and Dad weren't around. I just had a feeling. But I know now that you and Dad
gave your lives just for me. And I realize that even more
than the Nine Tails, my vessel is filled with your love! I'm happy! I'm glad I'm your son,
Mom and Dad! Minato, are you listening? Our hopes did reach our boy! Naruto… Thank you for letting me
be your mom. And thank you for letting
Minato be your dad. Thank you for being born to us! Thank you… so very much. Naruto faced and defeated
his true self here.

 Guy, why don't you try it out
for yourself!

 Don't be stupid!

 I came here to help Naruto!

 Are you afraid to face
your true self?

 What did you say?

 Okay then, I'll try it out!

 I have a feeling your true self
isn't human!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Battle in Paradise!
Odd Beast vs. The Monster!"

 Is that my true self?

 Tune in again!

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,070
Granny Chiyo. <i>What's going on...?</i> <i>That little girl shouldn't be able
to move anymore...</i> <i>Is Grandma controlling her?</i> <i>No, she wouldn't be able to make
such complicated movements</i> <i>in her condition...</i> <i>That little girl...
is moving under her own will...</i> <i>How is it she can move?</i> <i>I thought I nailed her with my poison.</i> Sakura...You... I used an antidote. When did you...get such a thing...? When I made the antidote for Kankuro
in the Village Hidden in the Sand... <i>I never imagined I'd find
this many medicinal herbs</i> <i>here in the Hidden Sand.</i> <i>However, it's quite difficult to grow
medicinal herbs in this type of location.</i> <i>We only have a small amount
of Scurvy Grass in particular...</i> <i>No, this is more than enough.</i> <i>I can make three doses of antidote.</i> I was able to make just three. I used one of them to heal Kankuro. <i>You should be all right now, I think.</i> <i>Just lie there and rest for
a while without moving</i> <i>until the numbness goes away.</i> I knew the enemy would use poison, so I made the other two into injections
and brought them with me. I see... So that's how... Yes, I used one of the two. However, the effects of the antidote
will only last around three minutes. No matter how often I get hit
with poison during that time, the effects of the medicine will turn
all of it into harmless proteins. I see... I couldn't let Sasori find out
that I had this antidote... I knew I'd have an opportunity after he revealed his final intentions
and let his guard down. So I couldn't use it until
the very last moment. Now there's only one left... I will hand this over to you,
Granny Chiyo. Right... Are you okay?! <i>Don't tell me
the poison was neutralized...</i> If you want to live that badly,
I won't finish you off. However, that poison will kill you
in less than three days... <i>Don't tell me they analyzed the components
using the poison from back then...</i> <i>No, that couldn't be.</i> <i>Even if by some chance they were able
to analyze the components,</i> <i>they shouldn't be able to
make an antidote that easily.</i> <i>The concoction of an antidote
is so difficult</i> <i>that even the slightest mistake
is not permissible.</i> <i>Even I, who made the poison,</i> <i>needed a ratio chart
for its concoction...</i> I'll heal you now. Now poison won't affect me for
the next three minutes. Everything depends on
those three minutes! Right... <i>Grandma, huh...?</i> <i>No, I'm the one who knows
the level of medical ability</i> <i>in the Hidden Sand more
than anyone.</i> <i>I made a poison that</i> <i>even she wouldn't be able to
immediately create an antidote for.</i> <i>So this kid's also
a Medical Ninja, huh...?</i> <i>If I recall, she's from the Leaf...</i> <i>The current Leaf Hokage Tsunade
is known as a top-notch Medical Ninja...</i> <i>Don't tell me...
she made the antidote...?!</i> <i>Three Minutes Between
Life and Death

 
</i> Sakura, my left hand's okay now. O-Okay... <i>Here I go!</i> <i>Incredible strength...evasion...
heals wounds...</i> <i>They all utilize a considerable amount
of Chakra...</i> <i>She's probably already reached
her limit...</i> Good grief. At this rate, I won't be able to show my face
to my man Sasori... I've got to use the rest of
my Detonation Clay and show him that I'm a real artist! And to do so... I'll get that Copy Ninja
out of the way! It took a little time,
but how about this?! <i>What?</i> <i>Unlike the bird-type from earlier,
these are sure small...</i> <i>Is that so they won't get picked off
by shuriken...?</i> <i>And this amount...</i> <i>Judging from the size
of their hind legs...</i> <i>I'd bet their special skill
is jumping strength.</i> <i>Then I guess we'll go with
a battle of speed!</i> Naruto! Hold on! You're too slow, Kakashi Sensei!
I'm going on ahead! Don't do anything reckless
on your own! Yeah, I know. <i>This might be a bit of a problem...</i> <i>For the time being,</i> <i>I stopped the bleeding
of the large wounds...</i> <i>I'll use all of my remaining Chakra
to attack!</i> <i>If I don't finish this during
the next three minutes,</i> <i>there won't be a next time!</i> <i>The effects of the antidote
will last three minutes...</i> We don't have any time. Can you fight right away,
Granny Chiyo? Very well. Let's end this! <i>Now then...</i> <i>this isn't the time to have
a staring contest with these things.</i> <i>If I leave Naruto on his own,
he could lose control at any moment.</i> <i>So by maintaining a fixed distance
equal to how far I retreat,</i> <i>they're preventing me from
breaking through...</i> <i>If so...!</i> <i>They'd...better be following me...</i> <i>Good work.</i> That takes care of him. What? Kakashi Sensei? Now at last, it's just the two of us. Don't scowl like that. Here I'm going to the trouble of
letting you see your friend. Yeah-yeah, as a fellow Jinchuriki, you can't keep your cool, can you? Give Gaara...back! Hold it! Kakashi Sensei...! Oh man, and I was totally convinced
that you'd died. Sorry, it wasn't the real me
that blew up. Next time, you'd better figure out
how to get them to tell the difference between
a real body and a Shadow Clone... <i>If  there's a next time, that is...</i> Hold it! That goes for you, too... It's okay. We'll definitely get Gaara back. So calm down! Sasori's gonna get mad at me again
for not being prepared enough... But it's not my style to think
about every little detail and always be perfectly prepared. Dealing with matters with
a flexible mindset, no matter what the situation, leads to developing sophistication
as an artist. What should I do? Listen up, Naruto. You're not accustomed to
that kind of enemy. Not only that, he's a long-range type, the worst match for someone like you;
who specializes in close-range battle. There are only two ways to
defeat this type of enemy. One is to draw the enemy
into a close-range fight and defeat them... The other is to outdo the enemy
with a long-range attack and defeat them. But, how do we do that...? No matter which method is taken, your unit needs either a comrade
who specializes in long-range attacks or one who can use support Ninjutsu
for long-range battles. In the event of having neither...
it's impossible to defeat the enemy. Well, it'd be different if you were as smart
as Shikamaru, though. Stop beating around the bush! If that's the case, then what about
you Kakashi Sensei...? Oh...me, huh? A Jonin who's as smart as Shikamaru and possesses support Ninjutsu
for long-range battles. Then we've got what we need! That's why I told you to calm down. Then we should get right to it... It won't work out that easily. He won't leave himself open
if we just chase him around. <i>Okay, you're in range!</i> Mission accomplished. He infiltrated the Hidden Sand by himself
and defeated Gaara. And most important...
he's a member of the Akatsuki. Hey, this isn't the time for me
to be taking it easy. Then what do we do? All we can do is create
an opening from our end. You and me together. If you were able to catch on to what I said, then lend me an ear. I'll tell you the plan. Let's go, Sakura! Right! <i>Heh... I'll admit it.
You're an impressive kid.</i> <i>Who would've thought she could destroy
the Third Kazekage...</i> <i>It's useless to use
other Human Puppets any longer.</i> I haven't used this since
I joined the Akatsuki... I can't remember when that was... Wh-What's that?! He hasn't aged at all since
he left my side. He's exactly the same as before... Scorpion
  

And that's the reason why... It's really been a long time... since I used myself. He turned himself... into a Human Puppet. Got it? Yeah, I got it! Let's go. <i>What...?</i> <i>If his entire body is a puppet...</i> <i>Then it's safe to assume</i> <i>all of the weapons inside his body
are covered with poison...</i> What's the matter...? <i>It's already been over a minute
since I gave myself the antidote shot...</i> Weren't you going to finish me off? If you're not going to attack me... <i>The effects of the antidote
will last less than two minutes.</i> <i>During that time...</i> <i>somehow, I need to turn this
into a close-range battle</i> <i>and then finish him off...</i> Then I'll make the first move! It's useless to hide! Now...what will you do? Open Ninja! Treasure Price Value! Today, we had Granny Chiyo
bring us these! The finest works of Puppet Master Jutsu,
by Monzaemon the First Puppeteer. If these are genuine,
it'd be a historical finding! There is no "if"'! And how much value would
the owner place on them? These are priceless, of course! I see. And how much value would
the Connoisseur place on them? These are truly fine works! Ah, looks like they've made the decision!
Open the price! One...10...100...
1000...10,000! Next time:
Puppet Fight: 10 vs. 100!" Thank you for letting me
be your mom. And thank you for letting
Minato be your dad. Thank you for being…
born to us! Thank you… Thank you so much. Mom… From now on, I promise I'll eat vegetables
and not just ramen. I like taking baths,
so don't worry about that. I go to the hot springs a lot too. And I get lots of sleep. In fact, I sleep too much,
ya know! As for friends,
I have lots of good ones. I wish you could have met them. There's one that I'm not
getting along with though. As for studying…
Well, you feared right, Mom. But I don't get depressed
over that, ya know! A lot happened with my teachers
and upperclassmen during my Academy days, but we respect each other now. Master Jiraiya taught me about
the Three Shinobi Prohibitions. You were right about him, Mom! But he's the one who taught me
how a shinobi should live! He was a great shinobi. I'm Naruto Uzumaki,
a ninja of the Hidden Leaf! My dream is to become the Hokage! And I'll surpass all the Hokage
who came before me! And I'm going to be cooler
than Dad! And I'm going to be
a stronger shinobi than you, Mom! Battle in Paradise!
Odd Beast vs. The Monster!"

 All right! What happened? Did it go well? A lot of things happened. Yo! I see! I get it!
Understood! Your expression now is looking good! What about the Nine Tails? Did you get it under control? That's real good news. Especially when you used it,
in that situation, yo! Whoa, Naruto!
Don't tell me that by that, you mean… You know what?! Yup! That's right, ya know! So tell me what happened! This, that… How am I supposed
to understand?! This is all on purpose! You're talking like that on purpose! That much I know! What?! Naruto's going through
harsh training like that?! I can't ignore a young man struggling during the springtime
of his youth! Take me to Naruto! He…is a bit eccentric. So I apologize. It's all right. Relax, Captain Yamato. I have the Nine Tails' chakra safe in a separate place inside me. So that I'm not using it all the time. This is how it is when I use
the Nine Tails' chakra. Amazing… It's overflowing with life energy. I can't believe my Wood Style
is affected by it. What? You really think… you're hidden? Do you sense some other chakra? He senses another's proximity…
That I couldn't, was hasty of me. Impossible! My chakra is the same as Samehada. There's no way
anyone could sense it! It's not chakra! It feels hazy…something sinister. That's it! That thing! The sword? It seems that you can sense hatred
and feelings of evil. The limitations of Sensory-Types
don't apply. Is that the power of a Jinchuriki who has mastery
over the Nine Tails? You're the shark guy of the Akatsuki! How? I thought we chopped
his head off a ways back… Let's do this! Okay… Brother! Water Style: Super Shark—! – Double Lariat!
– Double Lariat! How did you manage to escape
our tag-team attack? I simply switched out while we battled inside
the bubble of water. Ink… A smokescreen. You are an octopus, after all. However… With my body merged to Samehada, I can detect chakra
through my skin. You cut off my clone's head. Don't you think you're overdoing it? Don't you think that was
just right for the Eight-Tails? I guess it's my turn now. I leave it in your hands. Clones disappear
when they're struck! The corpse remained
post-mortem…no question. And if someone else had
transformed into you, Cee would have sensed it. So it's a perplexing consternation. It was a special kind of clone. A Parasitic Clone that I can
manipulate remotely. Anyway, enough about this subject. Now then, two Jinchuriki
and a Wood Style user… I am in a serious predicament. What? How did you know the way to
open the door to this room?! That's a silly question. I came here to spy. Was that the Teleportation Jutsu? The first smash… Just like the Yellow Flash! So fast… I didn't expect that. My foot! I had so much force,
I hit it too hard! It seems you're not up to
the Fourth Hokage's level yet. Bee! Please go after him! I'll see to Naruto. Right! Leave the chase to me.
I'll catch him in a jiffy. What? Your true self appears from
inside the waterfall? Is that for real? Yes. Naruto faced and defeated
his true self at this very spot. Guy, why don't you try it out
for yourself? Don't be stupid! We have to go and
help Naruto first! I came here as a teacher
to protect Naruto! Don't get so upset. Are you afraid to face
your true self? Is that it? What did you say? You think I'm scared? No problem! No, I was just joking. I have a feeling
your true self isn't human. Don't take me so seriously. Honestly, you really shouldn't be
going on about "youth," should you? Overdoing things can hurt
a man past his prime like you. I know you have to keep up
appearances for Lee's sake. But no one expects you to
force yourself to stay youthful. Show yourself! You can say what you like
to my face! Fine. You can take a long,
hard look at your true self. Is this my true self?! An Odd Insect? I'm sure this is…
the Odd Beast! What?! Hey me! The one who has
forgotten what youth is! I'll beat some sense into you! Guy! That's not your true self! Watch out! Leaf Rock… Crushing Square! It's not my true self. Take a good look! It's not you,
no matter how you look at it! The moment you open your eyes, you leave the Waterfall of Truth! This is… I'm certain it's… the fish they call puffer fish! No… Maybe it was
a porcupine fish? This region has lots
of strange creatures, so… Is that really a puffer fish?
It's supposed to be real tasty. Are you all deliberately
playing the fool? I see that you are still dumber
than a beast. He's an Akatsuki agent! If he escapes,
they'll get Intel on us. And that would be
a huge abasement! Damn you, Samehada… He's the shark fellow
of the Akatsuki who was teamed up with Itachi. He looks weakened. How did he get in? I see, I see… He forced you. That must've been pretty tough. That's kind of creepy. Hey, hey! Don't play too rough! But what can I say,
I got the right stuff! Darn it! He's underwater! He's a Water Style user! I'm aware of that. Bee, watch out! He's taking your chakra! Huh? Why do strong people tend to
be pretty dense, damn it?! Cut it out STAT… But you're so cute that… I'm getting weak in the knees… Guy! Please assist me! I'm going to get data
from him instead! Hidden Jutsu! Stone Needles! All right! A jutsu where chakra is poured
in to stop my movement. Now that's perfect! Is he absorbing my chakra instead? So much pull! Leaf Hurricane! You got all your chakra back. Water Style! Shark Bomb Jutsu! Damn it, he got away! He's fast! If he gets past the barrier
around this island, it's all over. We must stop him before that, because my sensory powers
won't work then. I'll stop him! The Eight Inner Gates! The Sixth Gate of Joy: Open! Let yourself be captured by
the arms of my Eight Tails… Odd Beast! Far, far away you'll go… In the direction of
ten o'clock I'll throw. Don't sacrifice the truth just
for a rhyme! He went towards two o'clock! All right! Are you all right, Bee? I'm okay. I'll be good right away. You got a lot of chakra
taken away from you! We may be able to stop him. Naruto and Yamato are behind
this waterfall, right? I twisted my ankle. Be careful about keeping
your power under control! All right. Let's go! Yeah! I'm counting on you! I was going to say it's been a while…
but really, midair? I'm going to borrow your back! Ouch!! Damn it, Guy!
Using me as a stepping-stone! Up we go. H-Hello… Looks like I gave them the slip. Summoning Jutsu… You're persistent! So… That scroll you gave to that
shark contains Intel on us. I won't let you get away! I wouldn't be so sure.
I have the geographical advantage. Water Style!
Thousand Hungry Sharks! I don't know which shark is which. In that case…! Asakujaku! Where's the scroll? Damn it.
There are too many of them. It can't be helped.
I have to cover a wider area. He won't let the sharks
in the water go either. Fine. I'll just let them tear you apart! The Seventh Gate of Shock! Open! I see… A taijutsu that crushes opponents
with a shock wave of air and flames created from
the friction of punched air! An Odd Beast indeed. A shinobi with taijutsu
this powerful is truly rare. This will be the third time for me. The next taijutsu will be nothing
like the previous ones. It's a special single-blow attack. It's something you'll rarely see… The blue chakra is pushing
the water away. Water Style! Super Shark Bomb Jutsu! Hirudora! This Super Shark Bomb is
no ordinary jutsu. The jutsu itself absorbs chakra
and becomes even stronger. And the stronger
the opponent's ninjutsu, And the stronger
the opponent's ninjutsu,
the stronger it gets. the stronger it gets. What's going on? I exhausted his jutsu… but my Super Shark Bomb
isn't getting stronger?! I know I absorbed his chakra! Was that not
a chakra Energy Bomb?! Roar, my youth! In the Hidden Mist, here is a great obstacle
one must overcome

 to be a true shinobi…

 The sensation of killing your own comrade
is indescribable.

 I will say that I felt I was trapped
in a false existence.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Man Named Kisame"

 This world really is full of lies.

 Tune in again!

 What is that? That's… Guy's Eight Inner Gates attack…
Hirudora! Hirudora? That's a lame name
for a jutsu. Considering Guy Sensei's obsession
with youth. There's no time to nitpick! The Hirudora has a wide blast radius,
and it hits instantly. Brace yourselves! Don't move. That jutsu… It wasn't an Energy Bomb, was it? And your blue aura… Hirudora is not
a chakra-based ninjutsu. It is taijutsu. It's just an ordinary punch,
but it's a super fast punch. A focused thrust of air pressure
right at your opponent. That compresses
and spreads in an instant. And this aura that envelops me
is not chakra… Those who open
the Seventh Gate of Shock, perspire blue sweat! That's what I'm evaporating
with my hot-blooded passion. I thought that looked too small
to be an Energy Bomb. This is my third time fighting you. But you still had something
like this up your sleeve. You probably don't remember me. I thought I told you not to move. The Man Named Kisame

 I got to hand it to
Bushier Brow Sensei for bringing this guy down! You're capable despite
your thick looks, Bushier Brows… But that blue sweat of yours,
packs some pows. If this goes well,
I'll be able to extract Intel about Akatsuki and its plans,
as well as the identity of its leader. I'm not as good as Inoichi,
but I'll give it a try. Here I go. Now then… Here comes the hard part… Hoshigaki… Won't you eat with us? There's no need to be nice to me. Hey, you heard him.
Just leave him alone! He doesn't like to rub shoulders
with Cipher Corps eggheads like us. We're on a joint mission. Things like that don't matter! Besides, we wouldn't have
anything to talk about. We're the brains. He's the brawn. W-What's the big idea? We need to set out immediately. Hoshigaki… About earlier…
How about after the mission? About having dinner. Now listen, Kisame. Guard the Cipher Corps and
protect the encoded missive. However, you must not allow
our any member of the Cipher Corps to fall
into enemy hands. Your mission is to guard the code,
whatever it takes. Do you understand what that means? Run! Surrender!
You're completely surrounded. There's no way you can win. I know you. You're that brilliant guy from the Leaf Anbu's Torture and
Interrogation Corps… Want to fight? Now's our chance. Run ! Capture them alive! There are just too many to protect. Keep going! Do not stop! Help me… What are you doing? Hoshigaki, what do we do? Hoshigaki? W-What are you doing?! However… You must not allow any member
of the Cipher Corps to fall into enemy hands. Your mission is to guard the code,
whatever it takes. Do you understand
what that means? Yes, I do. I shall not hand over any of
the Cipher Corps shinobi alive. Why? Because killing my comrades
is my special mission. What a terrible life… Your comrades…why? Why? You, of all people, should understand. We cannot let our code fall
into enemy hands. Besides, they would have
talked right away. If we both survive,
let's meet again. Kisame… You…! Good work, Kisame. I had a feeling he would let his guard
down with his subordinate. And I was right. He was collaborating
with the enemy. From this moment on, you are the master of
the great blade, Samehada. And my subordinate as well. That is, until you eliminate me too,
Lord Fourth Mizukage. I can trust you because
of who you are. You have executed
dirty missions for the sake of the nation and village. You've undertaken missions
of betrayal. You are well aware that this world
is full of lies and deceit. I knew that from the first moment
I killed a comrade. Killing a Hidden Mist ninja
despite being one myself. So what am I? Am I an enemy or an ally? What is my purpose?
Where do I stand in this world? Where must I go?
And where can I go to find inner calm? There is one thing that
is clear to me… I am trapped in
a false existence. Then I shall release you from
the pain of those falsehoods. I will create a place
where you belong. Who are you? First, we'll start with this nation. You have toiled to dispose
of your comrades up until now. From now on, work with me
as my comrade. You seem to have trust in me. But I still don't know who you are. Those eyes…
that gleam in the dark! I see… The one I thought was
the Fourth Mizukage… was actually you. To think the Fourth was being
manipulated by the Sharingan. This world really is full of lies. You have the visual prowess to
be able to control the Fourth… who is also the Jinchuriki
of the Three Tails. Just who are you? I am…Madara Uchiha. He is supposed to be dead. I don't believe you. Show yourself. Fine. You can decide whether
to trust me or not. I'll find out who Madara really is! His tongue…
He bit off his own tongue! He woke himself up to prevent me
from extracting Intel. Are you serious? Yes… That is my plan…
Project Tsuki no Me. That is a true world free of lies. I needed to get in there. I was using my Wood Style
to suppress his chakra, but he still has so much power left. He just doesn't know
when to give up. Capture him alive! We'll never have
another chance like this! I want to extract
more Intel from him! I know that! Water Prison Jutsu! I can't reach him because
of this wall of water! It's the guy with
the Water Prison Jutsu! Summoning Jutsu! What do we do? No need to panic. Even if he is who he is,
look at the situation he's in. He can't do anything. I'll get him! Itachi… It's just like you said. I'll be teaming up with you
from now on. I'm Kisame Hoshigaki,
formerly of the Hidden Mist, and an ex-member of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen. Pleased to meet you. And you are Itachi Uchiha,
formerly of the Hidden Leaf. I've heard the rumors… You slaughtered all of
your fellow Uchiha clansmen. I understand you well. That's the reason why I decided to
team up with you in Akatsuki. The sensation that comes
from killing your comrade is indescribable, isn't it, Itachi? You talk a lot. You may know a lot about me,
but what about yourself? You got lost in the mist
and ended up here. You're just a thug who
couldn't figure out where to go. Isn't that so? Do you want to know
something interesting? Some sharks are ovoviviparous
which means the eggs hatch inside
the female's body, then are born. However, with some kinds of sharks,
the numbers of eggs that hatch don't match up with
the number of pups born. Do you know why? Cannibalism. When the eggs hatch,
the pups resort to cannibalizing their siblings
in the mother's belly. From the moment they are born,
the fratricide begins. Other than itself,
every other pup is fodder. From today, you and I
belong to Akatsuki. Please be wary… of me. That goes for you too. Anyway, let's have fun together. And hope that we're not
the last two facing each other. Anyone who has raised
their hand against a comrade, even once,
never dies a decent death. Remember that. Which means you and I
are both worthless. No… We aren't fish, we're human. No matter who you are… No matter who you are…
you do not know what kind of human
you are until the very end. you do not know what kind of human
you are until the very end. One realizes their true nature
at the moment of death. That's the way to view death. Itachi… Did you realize
the kind of person you were… at the moment of your death? Itachi… It seems I wasn't such… a worthless human, after all. Feeding yourself to the shark
you just summoned… He was already quite weak. He figured out that
he couldn't escape us. The Akatsuki member who was
paired up with Itachi himself… The one who was feared as
the scourge of the Hidden Mist. It's hard to believe this is
the way Kisame Hoshigaki met his end. Is he really dead? This fella's downhearted Looks like it's for real this time. The guy's already departed. But… He did this so that we, his enemy,
wouldn't get any Intel. Even in the Akatsuki, there was someone
who put his comrades first. He may have been a foe,
but he died admirably. The measure of a shinobi's life
is determined by the manner of his death. Kisame Hoshigaki! I will never forget you! In any case, no Intel was leaked
to the Akatsuki. He intended to put down Intel
about us onto this scroll and get out of here. Let's check the contents
of the scroll. If we know what kind of data
he was after, it will make
counter-intelligence easier. You're right. The water is so heavy… This is the Water Prison Jutsu! It was a booby trap! Watch out! Sharks! Damn, it's making its way
towards the ocean! The water pressure is making it
hard to move! Fools, ya fool! I used up all my strength
on the Eight Inner Gates… Guy, hang in there! Watch where you're biting! Damn it! It's getting away! What do we do?! Just as Yahiko believed in Nagato,

 Nagato believed in Naruto.

 Since he is carrying on their wishes,
I will believe in Naruto.

 If you're telling me to
sever those feelings, I will…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Angelic Herald of Death"

 I will kill you!

 Tune in again!

 You're finally going out. Well, there have been
a lot of changes to our plans. I wish you wouldn't say it
like I'm to blame. Thanks to you,
we had to change our strategy. Thanks to me, your military strength and variations
of attack increased, didn't they? Don't do anything strange
while I'm away. We're comrades.
You should trust me more. You only look after
your own interests. You won't even tell me
where you're off to? The Hidden Rain Village. The Hidden Rain? They're not even directly involved
in the Great Ninja War, so why are you going now? It doesn't concern you. Wait, Yahiko! Wait! I'm first! It's a toad, a toad!
A giant toad! How'd it get inside our hideout? What'll we do? You're so noisy!
What's all this ruckus about? Jiraiya Sensei? Well? Does it look good on me? Now that you mention it,
I guess so… What's so funny? It's not funny! The Angelic Herald of Death

 Looking for something? Yeah. Where did you put Nagato's corpse? You won't find him here. The Rinnegan… It seems you aren't going
to cooperate and tell me where you hid Nagato. I knew that you would
appear before me. I've been waiting for you. So I could stop you. Just because you used
to be a comrade does not mean
I'll show you any mercy. The Akatsuki does not
put up with traitors. Understand? I have one question. Why would such loyal members
as you both betray me? You and Nagato both approved
of my Project Tsuki no Me. If you lost to Naruto Uzumaki, then it couldn't have
been helped. But…Nagato sacrificed his life, using the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu,
for Naruto's sake. That jutsu was to be used
for my sake. I never imagined that
Pain would be defeated. We must notify Tobi. Let's go. But even Zetsu did not see
what made Nagato change his mind. I have told you my story. Now let me hear your answer. TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA But I have faith that
there will come a time when people can truly
understand one another. I get where you're coming from now. But I still… can't forgive you. I still hate you. Do you want to settle this, then? But… Pervy Sage believed in me,
and left me his quest. So I'm going to believe
in Pervy Sage's belief. That's my answer. Don't play with me! It's far too late for me to
believe Jiraiya's words! There's no such thing as true peace! As long as we live in
this cursed world, peace is impossible! Then… Then…I'll break that curse. If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! I'll never give up! You… That's… Nagato? What's wrong? Those…words… That's right. They're taken straight from this book. The first novel written by Pervy Sage. Pervy Sage was seriously trying TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA
to change the world with this. At the end of this book,
he wrote about a student who helped JIRAIYA

provide him with inspiration. It was you, Nagato. No… TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

 TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

And… the name of the hero
in this novel… is Naruto! My name is a precious memento
from Pervy Sage! I can't just give up and
stain the memento from my master! I will be the Hokage! And I will bring peace
to the Hidden Rain! Please believe in me! How? How can you say that
you will never change? That you will not change, no matter how great
the pain you face. Can you continue believing
in yourself? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith in yourself?! And there's a lot of pain nesting
inside of me as well. There's no telling what kind
of pain will come after me. But… TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

If I stop believing because of that… TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

 TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

If the hero should change, it'll turn into another story. from the one my master left behind. Then it won't be Naruto! I can't write novels like
my master did. That's why the sequel has to
come from the life I live. No matter how great the pain,
I'll continue walking. Because that's who Naruto is! Naruto Uzumaki…
You think he's that worthy? He is the light. That's why we all… can carry flowers of hope! You bare your fangs at me, yet you still continue to
wear that cloak. I see that you are still attached
to the Akatsuki. Yahiko founded the Akatsuki. The red cloud on this cloak
symbolizes the blood that rained over
the Hidden Rain from war! You are just riding on its coattails. These cloaks are our legacy, not yours. Furthermore, Nagato,
a shinobi of the Hidden Rain, awakened the Rinnegan. And that too, does not belong to you. His eyes are this nation's…
this village's treasure! You are mistaken on two points. It's all over for you anyway,
so I will tell you. I am the one who encouraged Yahiko
to establish the Akatsuki. And I was also the one
who gave Nagato the Rinnegan. So it's only right for me
to ask for it back. Well, no matter. As far as I'm concerned, you're just a girl
who knows nothing. Except that, right now, you know where Nagato's Rinnegan is. Once I capture you,
I can do anything I want. Do not underestimate
the visual prowess of the Uchiha, girl! Using a manifold attack, she intends to find a chance
to attack when I materialize. Fine. I know she has
some strategy to tempt me. I accept her challenge! Over here! She mixed in Paper Bombs! I will take you with me
to the afterlife. We lost another member
in the Seventh Ward. That place is turning
into guerilla warzone. We'd better deal with it now. I'll go scout it out in the afternoon. Nagato, rest awhile. Don't overdo it. No, but… No buts. Rest. I will go. Be careful, Yahiko. You don't need to see me off! See to Nagato's wound, will you? From now on,
save your worrying for him. Nagato is the keystone
of the Akatsuki! He will become the man who changes this nation
and this world! The same can be said of you. Everyone respects and admires you. Nagato is no different. Nagato is going to be…
the bridge to peace. My job is to be a pillar
that supports that bridge. Yahiko. This nation continues to weep. It continues to endure pain. I used to hate this land
that cries all the time. But now, I want to save it. It's what I want with all my heart. It reminds me of the crybaby
that I used to be and I can't ignore it. Yahiko! Be careful. He is the bridge to peace. His will itself is the bridge. Nagato… We believe in Yahiko! Let's go, everyone! Right! I will be a pillar that supports
two bridges: Yahiko and Nagato! I didn't take you seriously enough. I should have remembered that you are a former member
of the Akatsuki… The moment I sucked you in, you intended to blow yourself up,
and take me with you. However, you failed. I sucked in the explosion itself. I was faster, although I felt
a little of the impact. And luckily, you were spared too. You should be grateful. Does this mean
your secret strategy is over? Madara, let me ask you one thing. What is it? Do you know why we betrayed you? Do you know why
we have faith in Naruto? Well now… That's your problem. Besides, Naruto is just
a naïve child chasing after an immature dream. I can see if Nagato was swayed by the thought of true peace
and hope. But you too, Konan? I realized something
after meeting Naruto. You're taking this one with you too? Yes, Tendo Pain was created
from Yahiko's body. He is very precious to us. So he was…Yahiko? So what are you going to do? I hate to think you're returning
to the Akatsuki. I'm leaving the Akatsuki. Yahiko and Nagato meant
everything to me. Yahiko's dream…
and Nagato's dream… If both of their dreams have
been passed on to you, you now embody their dreams. Nagato put his faith in you. So will I. We, the Hidden Rain, will pursue
both their dreams with you. The name Naruto, the guts
to never give up, and pain. That's what I inherited from
my master and fellow disciple! This time… I pray that you will be the blossom
of hope that never wilts. You are darkness. Flowers can only wilt in
a world without light! They both fought and
died following their beliefs. Nagato is the one who will
become the bridge to peace. Yahiko's will itself is
the bridge to peace. Their will shall not be extinguished! If there is such a thing as peace,
I'll seize it! Naruto Uzumaki will be
the one to carry on their will! Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Bridge to Peace"

 I shall be the pillar that supports him!

THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

 THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

 ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES
PART 1 Lead…lead…lead… That guy… He thinks he's so hot. I'm totally going to steal a base. Lead…lead…lead… Did you call me, Naruto? I wasn't calling you! Out! Huh?! Did I do something wrong? Tune in again!

 THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

 I won't let you get away! Your teleportation failed. I've been paying attention
to you all this time. When you suck in yourself,
you always materialize yourself. And it takes longer to suck yourself in
than another person or object. If I didn't stop teleporting and shift
to the side to evade the explosion, things would've turned nasty. Furthermore, you are only able to pass through objects
for five minutes! What are these? They're all Paper Bombs… I amassed 600 billion Paper Bombs
in order to kill you… And they will continue to
explode for ten minutes! I am the one who encouraged Yahiko
to establish the Akatsuki. And I was also the one who
gave Nagato the Rinnegan. Both Yahiko and Nagato were
acting on their own free will. They were not your pawns! You and Konan must do
everything you can to survive! Whichever way they chose… They both fought and died
following their beliefs! That is why their will is connected! I will not let you interfere! My Sacred Paper Emissary Jutsu
has come undone. I didn't expect it to take
this much chakra. At least… Madara is… …Is dead? How? You should be dead. I ran the simulations over and over. I was sure this sequence
would work. The Izanagi… In exchange for losing sight
in that eye, a user can tie the illusion
and reality together. It's a Forbidden Jutsu
of the Uchiha. Only those who possess both the powers
of the Uchiha and Senju can use this Forbidden Jutsu! Uchiha and Senju?
Both powers? But that's the power
of the Six Paths. You do not have that power… Since you are a dear
and former comrade, I will tell you a little about
my jutsu and myself. The Izanagi jutsu is simply
the practical application of what you already know as the Sage of Six Paths'
Creation of all Things. Originally, the Uchiha and Senju
were one and the same. The Sage of the Six Paths
was their founder and he passed on his blood
and power to these two. He also created many things. The Power of the Shadow Style, based upon mental energies
that control imagination that can be used to create
form out of nothing. And the Power of the Light Style, based upon physical energies that govern life that could be used
to instill life into those forms. The Tailed Beasts are
one such example. He used the Powers of
the Shadow and Light Styles to create the Tailed Beasts from
the chakra of the Ten Tails. The incarnation of imagination
into life… that is the jutsu known as Izanagi. Just who are you? The world knows Madara Uchiha
was the one who lost to Hashirama Senju. However, what is the real truth? The victor is the one
who can gaze into the future. The real challenge begins from now. The previous battle was merely
to obtain his power. I am Madara Uchiha and I possess
the power of Senju Hashirama. I am the second
Sage of the Six Paths. I am unique. Unable to master Hashirama's power, some have tried to use
an imperfect Izanagi, and failed. In the afterlife,
the two of you can commiserate… about being fooled
by Naruto's nonsense. There is no such thing
as true peace! There is no such thing as hope! Nagato only believed in Naruto
because he wanted to find solace within
his pathetic existence. This can't be… Nagato is going to be
the bridge to peace. My job is to be a pillar
that supports that bridge. He is the bridge to peace.
His will itself is the bridge. I guess this is
as far as it goes for me. Naruto…I know you can truly— The rain in the Hidden Rain
is never ending… What's going on? Yahiko! Nagato! Your will shall not be extinguished! I too believe in Naruto! It's his turn now! He is the bridge to peace! And I shall be his pillar! Thank you, Nagato. You death has made my dream
even clearer to me. I am expendable, a mere flower. I shall take you with me. You called me darkness. Well then, I shall make you wilt. And I shall also make your rainbow, this seven-colored bridge of peace,
fade into the darkness as well. When this genjutsu is over,
it will be the end of you too. After I make you tell me
where the Rinnegan is. So this is the place… You are the third
Sage of the Six Paths. The red hair that was once proof
of your Uzumaki lineage… turned white from exerting
a power so strong. You betrayed me,
and still you laugh at me? That took some time. I should go. NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN



 NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN



The one on the right is Konan's. NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN


The one in the center is Yahiko's.
Nagato's is on the left. What are they? These are flip tiles. Flip tiles? Yes. The top is red and
the bottom is white. And you flip the tiles
over like this! Anyway, when we're at the hideout, the tile will show red. NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN


When we're going out,
flip it to the white side… NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN



then set out. Furthermore, this picture is a signal
that you'll be returning shortly. Man, what's with all this anyway? We're only listening to this flip stuff
because you're the Toad Sage. But why is it necessary
to do all this? This area is still politically unstable. There's no telling when
it will be targeted. Actually, being at the hideout
makes us easy marks. If we're all scattered,
we can counter, with a surprise attack, for example. So if the tile is red,
but someone's not at the hideout, it could mean the enemy
has kidnapped them. But if they're here and it's white, could mean it's a transformed enemy. It's so we'll be able to recognize
things like that right away, correct? Something like that. You're very sharp, Konan.
Unlike Yahiko. I figured it out too! More or less… Anyway, this will be a secret code
between the four of us to make sure we're aware
of each other at all times. Even if we're at the hideout,
we must be vigilant! Furthermore… I constructed
a hidden underground room that has an escape route outside. Wow, that's so shinobi! If anything happens,
use it to get away. Oh, and by the way… The tile behind you is… JIRAIYA

…is my tile. JIRAIYA

 Now then… Shall we begin our
"Water in a Frog's Face" training? This will hone your ability to
completely become a frog and stay absolutely still,
no matter what happens. All right! Let's get going, everyone! I wonder if Yahiko is getting all this? Sensei just showed us what to do. I want to become stronger! And then… And then,
I'm going to change the world! Before you change the world, you must change
the side on the flip tile! Did I look like that earlier too? That's embarrassing. NAGATO             YAHIKO            KONAN Oh? She used the Wind Style to
speed up her Paper Shuriken. However… Damn it! No good. You have get quicker with
timing your coordination! NAGATO            YAHIKO                KONAN



 NAGATO            YAHIKO                KONAN



Let's eat! – Let's eat!
– Let's eat! Hey! No fair, Sensei! Oh yeah, is that so? That's mine! JIRAIYA

 Thank you, Sensei. NAGATO           YAHIKO                KONAN Are you the Akatsuki? Who's that? The chief of the Hidden Rain,
Hanzo of the Salamander… Who's the leader? It's Yahiko!
Yahiko of the Akatsuki! I shall remember you. Yahiko? What does that mean? Hanzo just acknowledged us. NAGATO            YAHIKO          KONAN



 NAGATO            YAHIKO          KONAN


Our organization is getting larger.
We need to move our hideout. It's our last day here. Yes. This place changed us. We became strong. Everything began right here. We are leaving this place in order
to make our dreams come true! And… Where did they go? To think the secret room
would come in handy at the very end. What a way to set out… But I guess,
it's appropriate for this country. Let's go, Nagato! Konan! We are leaving this place in order to make
our dreams come true! And once that happens… Even if we are split apart, let's meet back here one day… And the three of us will
celebrate together! Yes. Then we should invite
Jiraiya Sensei too! Yes! I guess you're right! That took a lot of trouble, but you got yourself a nice eye. It was always mine. By the way, this arrived too. What is it? Intel from Kisame. We've learned the whereabouts
of the Nine Tails. Everything is going our way. So this is from Kisame. Let's go collect the Nine Tails! I can't believe the enemy
knows our whereabouts!

 We have to get Naruto out of here,

 but we can't let him
know about the war.

 We have to fool him somehow.

 All right!

 I've been waiting for
a mission like this!

he's stupid! ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES
PART 2 Hop… Step… Jump! Sakura, are you watching me? How was that? Foul! Tune in again!

 Lost sight of my target. That spy pulled one over me.
Should have figured out their intent… Are you all right, Guy Sensei? I'll help you out! Hey! Do not touch Guy right now! He'll be experiencing the after-effects
of the Eight Inner Gates soon. Even the slightest touch will cause him
intense pain all over his body! What? Really? I'm sorry, ya know! Quietly, quietly! Because of the Water Prison Jutsu, I wasn't able to send a message
about the intel leak. I think we can conclude that
the enemy knows about this location. Which means we must act quickly
to relocate Bee and Naruto! The enemy will figure that out too
and take immediate action! I understand, but… We will relocate them, but not by ship. They will remain on this island. What? Leave him alone! Bee! How did it go? Not good! Fool, ya fool. What do you mean when
you say you'll relocate them, but they'll remain on this island? You can't even find this island
on a map. Even if they try to find it,
it won't be that simple. The reason is because
this island… Y-You're huge! But I am still a very,
very small turtle. Impossible! I've never seen nor heard of
any turtle larger than you! What did you say?! Yes, a mobile stronghold,
an island that can move. This is a colossal turtle reared
by the Hidden Cloud since ancient times. Ouch! We can say for sure that
the enemy knows about this. However, this island is much safer than returning to the Hidden Cloud
Village by ship. Besides, hasn't Naruto been told
that he's here on this island for a top-secret ecological
survey mission? He'll get suspicious if
we tell him we're already leaving. It seriously hurts! The Super Secret S-Rank Mission The Five Great Nations face
an extremely critical situation. And as they prepare for
the Fourth Great Ninja War, there is concern that the shinobi and
samurai units will not be sufficient. Hence, a third military unit,
made up of animals will be formed. To this end, it has been decided
that a Jinchuriki who is able to communicate with
and understand animals… One who loves animals
like Naruto Uzumaki will be given the task of selecting and
organizing this animal unit. He will start by analyzing
the biology of the animals, – Can we pass off…
– then ascertain their strengths… – such a childish trick?
– and categorize them… – We have to.
– by gender and physical attributes. This is a top-secret S-rank mission! Work diligently. Fifth Hokage Tsunade of
the Hidden Leaf Village. This… – This?!
– This?! This is the kind of brainy mission
I've been waiting for! It's kind of like the ones
that Shikamaru always gets… where you coordinate people! We're talking animals. Leave it to Naruto…
He didn't notice. They say that Jinchuriki are odd people. And that's putting it mildly. Granny Lady Tsunade understands! She wants to test
my leadership skills! All right! I'm raring to go
on this mission! While you're doing that,
I'll work on a new rap. I don't owe you anything anymore,
not even a scrap! Yeah! Don't "yeah" me!
You have to help me! You know all about the animals
on this island, don't you? Ask King! He's the boss of this island! King? Hey! Can you help me out here? I'm looking for the strongest ones
on this island! I really can't understand
a thing you're saying! Master King is saying to show him
your proof of loyalty. Proof of loyalty? Hey! That voice! Condor the Ninja Ostrich?! Did you run away again?! Actually, I stowed away on your ship. Now I'm free! Freedom! Unfortunately for you, the animals on this island
are going to serve in an animal unit. Looking forward to working with you! You've got to be kidding! I don't want to go to war! Really? Then listen up… If you serve as my animal translator,
I'll let you go. Damn it… This is his proof…his kiss of love. Come on! Give me a break! Master King says he understands. Besides him, the strong ones
on this island are… Don the giant koala. DON THE KOALA Chuji the giant penguin. CHUJI THE PENGUIN And the giant lame-o…
I mean hippo, Hippo Boss. HIPPO BOSS Keep them apart! He says if they come face to face,
they'll destroy the island. They're scary animals… Yikes! They're already
confronting each other! King is totally the fiercest! What are they saying? This seems to be a four-way
love affair involving one female. What did you say?! Each one is claiming their affections
for her and won't budge. Master King is demanding that
she be brought here… to choose among them. Are you sure about this? What's that? Huh? What the—? This is mayhem. What? What's going on? He's saying, "Armadiko is my girl!" Huh?! "Stop fighting!" "Don't fight over me," she says. "I am not your commodity," she says. "I belong to this one," she says! Huh?! They said they're going to
beat you to death! This is perfect! Now's my chance to slip away. No way am I going to war! I'm free! Freedom! Wait… I will go to the Eight and
Nine Tails' location. What are you up to? It's a good chance to build trust
and solidify our relationship. Furthermore, Naruto,
the Nine Tails, always has someone close by
in the form of Yamato, the copy of the First Hokage. I want him for my experiments. If I can't go,
I'd settle for Zetsu's body. If you'd let me have some of him. Also, the revival of the Ten Tails
isn't far off, is it? You seem to be very well informed. I knew Orochimaru was secretly
checking around, but… According to intel that Kisame sent, the Allied Shinobi Force
is 80,000 strong. We also know what
their military formation is like. But the key military power for
this side is Zetsu here, right? Just how much do you know?! With the data I have gathered
and my knowledge, I can maximize Zetsu's strength. On the condition that
you take me there. What are you going to do, Tobi? Will you trust a guy like him? If you bring me the Nine Tails,
I will give you one of Zetsu. Follow me. This is… the Gedo Statue. It's down here. This is… Yes, he's alive. That's Hashirama Senju,
the First Hokage. Well, he was merely cultivated
from living cells harvested from Senju
during that battle. He's not conscious. But what you're interested in
is down below. This is amazing. Since when? However, there's a risk. I used a considerable amount
of chakra from the Tailed Beasts inside
the Gedo Statue to create this. I want to preserve it
as much as possible. If the revival of
the Ten Tails is delayed, it means my plans are
delayed as well. How many are here? Roughly 100,000. To arrive here to find that
intel has been leaked… We'll have to rethink our strategy. But as long as they know that the Allied Shinobi Forces
are aware of the leak, they will watch the situation. Perhaps it will be easier
to lay some traps. What about the island? Even if it's mobile,
we can't let our guard down. Those two are their targets. They are sure to come
in search of them. I established an escape route
just for situations like this. In addition, the clouds hide it. The enemy will not be able
to find it. If they come searching, the enemy will probably
send a small reconnaissance team first. They won't infiltrate and try
to divide our troops, will they? There's no doubt Kisame put
the coordinates of the island on the map. Even if we move,
they will search the area thoroughly. We can't lose focus. In any case, send reinforcements. But it will be meaningless if the enemy spots us
mobilizing large groups. Send a few of the elite. I will go! Lord Tsuchikage! Old Ohnoki?
Then I have no complaints. Same here. Someone who can fly through
the air will move swiftly. Is it really all right? Don't worry, Kazekage! I am the Tsuchikage, feared as the Fence Sitter
of the Hidden Stone! My back! I will go, after all. I can ride my sand and
be there in no time… Fool! I said I would go. Well, you guys relax. We're off. It's the ocean from here on out. We'll have to fly. Yay! It's been so long since I flew! This is going to be fun! Don't get so excited, Akatsuchi! We could be entering into a battle! Yay! I said to quit playing around,
you brat! You're so embarrassing! Damn it! It does looks like fun! But I can't get excited right now. Damn that Akatsuchi! You're up next Kurotsuchi. Guess I have no choice… Looks like you're awake at last. It's a different seal from
Lord Orochimaru's. I won't bind you completely…Deidara. I don't know anything about art. And I know little about you. Well, my ninjutsu art isn't easy
to understand… Hmm! But I'm grateful to you.
I once perfected the ultimate art. So now I can even go even further… Speaking of which,
that last explosion of yours… It really didn't create a lot of buzz. I just told you! My art is not easy to understand! These things take time… Hmm… I said to line up straight! Hurry and get into the tunnel! Listen up! The ecological survey
will start once you're inside. Cut it out! You want to fight again? Damn it! It's tough moving
all these animals. I win again! Rock, Scissors, Paper! And I'm going to win again
forever and ever! Hey you there, octopus and crab! Line up! Hey! As long as there is a risk of
the Akatsuki coming, taking refuge inside
the giant turtle shell is a wise move. Plus, Naruto is really taking
this mission seriously. It will be disastrous if
Naruto finds out about the war. He won't take the news quietly,
he'd rush to the battlefield instead. We must prevent that at all cost. After all, this is a war to protect Naruto. Based on Kisame's intel,
these are the coordinates. But they've already moved out. That was a light punch. I'm certain this person is… Of all the people to ambush me, it's none other than
the Tsuchikage himself. I was just testing you out. Judging from your response,
you're a clone! It wasn't Madara, after all. And… What's going on with bird and Deidara? Let's just say, they're almost real. However, you are… a clay clone. Hey, Old Man Ohnoki. Long time no see! You too, huh? So what's going on with
that Turtle Island?!

 The Eight Tails and Nine Tails
are there.

 The Eight and Nine Tails?

 So that means that
damn Naruto is there! Hmm!

 Isn't he the perfect opponent
to "exhibit" your art to?

 First, stop the Turtle Island's movements.

 Deidara, make me a big one.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Artist Returns"

 Let's make this one flashy! Hmm!
THE ARTIST RETURNS THE ARTIST RETURNS ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES
PART 3 Guy Sensei! Lee! When it's necessary to use
the Drunken Fist… Eat this! A Chocolate Bomb that
only good children can eat. Yes, Guy Sensei! Down the hatch! That's so weird… What's the matter? I had a bomb right here, but… Tune in again!

 All right! I'm going to start on
the ecological survey! Hey! Hey wait! Hey Octopops, I can't tell whether
this one's a male or female. Its body's all curled up. This armadillo's always been shy. If you're trying to check
its gender, I can see why. The chorus sings out about
this super abnormality… Because now we see
a human's real pervert personality… I have no choice! This is a top-secret
S-rank mission and I have to make the list
for the Animal Unit! And checking for gender is crucial! Male, female, it don't matter. So just report that it's the latter. But! But! The markings on
the back read "Male." That's just a pattern. I just have a bad feeling
about this. Ask the armadillo will ya,
old man? You're the boss here, right? Well? It says its, "privates are private!" Oh, is that right? Damn it!
How can I do any research? This S-rank mission is
living up to its rank…or is it?! Male and female… Some species can switch
between both, yo! But heaven and earth
can never switch places, yo! Fool, ya fool… What?! Something is approaching
at high speed! And it's…not human! What's the matter? You took me by surprise. I had heard that
you were dead, Deidara. I never expected your clay clones. So that was… …a stone clone of the Tsuchikage. We were thinking
the same thing. Hmm! Brother Deidara! I thought you blew
yourself up in a big way. Why are you still alive? So you didn't die, after all? Don't get excited, Akatsuchi! It's Orochimaru's jutsu,
called the Reanimation Jutsu. It may seem as though
he was brought back to life, but he's not real. Damn it. Still causing trouble,
even in death! A youngster from
the Hidden Leaf beats you… And then you have the gall
to sneak back in amongst the living! Shut up!
I killed Sasuke Uchiha…hmm! And now it's your turn, geezer,
for mocking my art! Hmm! Seems Deidara doesn't
know anything. Enough! I'll capture you both! Do you intend to get in our way? I knew we would be ambushed. You didn't think we'd come
unprepared, did you? What do you mean? Impossible! They've found out
about this place already? Th-There's no way…! Motoi… THE ARTIST RETURNS

 Seems we found them. Sorry, but we have to go there. Why? What? My body won't
respond to me! No way!
Don't tell me he found them! We're going after him, you two! – Right!
– Gotcha! What's going on? I used various drugs to activate
the original Manda's cells to create a Second Manda… He surpasses the First Manda
in size, power, and intellect! The fact that the island is
an animal and is mobile turns out to be its fatal flaw. What is that? An island? What's that island supposed to be? It's not an island. It's a giant turtle and it's moving. And that is where we'll find
the Eight and Nine Tails. A turtle? The Eight and Nine Tails? This is our chance to capture
the Eight and Nine Tails! I get it! So that damn Naruto
is there! Hmm! What's the plan? In any case,
we have to stop that turtle island. Deidara, give me a big one. Damn! They're fast! Let's go! Right. Katsu! Wood Style:
Deep Forest Emergence! It flipped over. It can't move now. Oww… What happened? Heaven and Earth really
did trade places, yo. Fools, ya fool! I knew it! Even if Heaven and Earth flip over… A male is still a male and… This is no time to be doing
an ecological survey! Calm down, Yamato. Remember, this is an S-rank mission. Something must have
happened outside. But we have to keep fooling him. We cannot allow those two
to leave this place. We have to deal with it ourselves. Kabuto, you search for
the Eight and Nine Tails. Hmm… I'll handle those guys.
I owe them nothing less. Fine, let's do that. Deidara! You shall feel my wrath. Damn it, the geezer's snapped. You haven't forgotten, have you? This is getting bad! Don't tell me he's going right
to his Particle Style?! Hmm! Things are starting to get out of hand. I won't let you get away! What are you doing, Akatsuchi?! If you do that, you'll end up
killing turtle island! Damn! This is complicated! It's so large that it just looks
like a landscape! There's my chance! Hmm! Katsu! Old man! Akatsuchi's Golem! Still attached to the Tsuchikage I see… What a nuisance! Hmm! I should get him away
from this island. That damn snake! So that guy over there is
the one controlling the snake! The nerve of that wimp. He was just pretending to
be Orochimaru's henchman! I see…
So Naruto is inside this turtle. Now then, how do I get in? Damn it! What's going on outside?! Th-There've been
a lot of tremors today… Y-You're right. Still, this is too weird. Can the world turn upside down? Well, it seems to be possible
on this island. Although it's an extremely rare event. Oh really? I think I'm going to take
a look outside! No! You're on
an important S-rank mission, so stay focused! Yeah, well… I'm just going to take
a quick look outside. It is a ninja's duty to see through
his mission until completion! And this is a mission
only you can accomplish! That's why you were selected. Do you understand, Naruto? We will see what's going on outside. That's about the only way
we can contribute here. However, let me repeat. You are on a crucial S-rank mission! Even Naruto is beginning
to sense something. We bluffed him into thinking
this is an S-rank mission. But basically,
he's just checking to see if an animal has balls or not. Naruto's not an idiot. He might have already
figured it out. Okay, I understand! I'm going to focus on my mission! All right!
This is going work out! Thank goodness he's so dense! You're too slow! Corrosion Style: Quicklime Jutsu! There they are. Is that him?! There should be five humans! So Aoba is here too. Don't come crawling out! Didn't we say that
we'd take care of this? Having said that… You're the Tsuchikage's
granddaughter… Perfect timing.
You can take me to Naruto. A snake… And that voice.
Don't tell me you're… We meet again, Yamato. I'll sweep him your way! So get him! Water Style: Water Trumpet! Nice! No good! He had it figured out! I told you guys to get him, but… I got him! This is… I see… Idiot! Now you can't move! My Quicklime Jutsu is like
fast-acting cement. I spread it around
an area with water… making it cause a reaction
that makes it harden like cement. Motoi, Aoba! Don't step into that water. That's for extra insurance! All right! You're ours! I'll extract intel out of you! The geezer is faster than
he was in his prime! You've always snuck around
and fought from a distance. I never liked that about you! Shut up! I'll finish him off with my C4…
Hmm! They're too fast! I can't keep up! Kabuto, how you've fallen. You've become just like Orochimaru. Never mind me.
Just make sure you don't fall off! Aoba, concentrate! Yeah, I know. I'm okay. You know that I'm in
the Intel Division, don't you? I'm going to take a look and see
everything that's happened to you. He's molted?! He's gone that far? Motoi, get away! Yamato! Damn it! Lucky for me, Kurotsuchi, I knew
the hand signs for your jutsu. I was able to
put you all off guard. Are you saying that
you waited for this moment? Damn! Corrosion Style: Quicklime Jutsu! Wait! Damn! He hid inside the nose! This should be high enough. Don't underestimate me,
old geezer! Prepare to die, Deidara! Let's see which one is real art, your Particle Style or
my Explosion Style! This is—?! What?! Right when we were getting
to the good part! Hmm! Damn! I can't move! Hold on! When the kid from Hidden Rock returns,
she'll free you! You're…Lord Tsuchikage! Deidara got away.
What about you guys? Someone from
the Hidden Rock went after him. Please help me!
I'll go after them! Which way did Kabuto go? I can't sense the enemy anymore. I can't tell which direction…
It's useless. Damn it. Yamato's been… What happened? The Wood Style user,
the Nine Tails' guardian, Yamato has been taken. He didn't bother going after
the Eight or Nine Tails. We don't know if he wanted
a hostage to interrogate… or if the Wood User himself
was the target. But the problem is the intel that
can be gleaned from Yamato! Yamato would never break down
to reveal intel that easily! That's not what I meant. If our foe is Madara, he will
have formidable visual prowess. Once someone is caught
under his visual prowess, there's no breaking away. This present you brought is very
different from what I expected. You're right. But he is
the Nine Tails' guardian and he also possesses
highly classified intel. Furthermore, I can use him to make Zetsu and
the others much stronger. Instead of pushing my luck, I decided to settle by
just capturing him. This works out better for you guys. Then hurry up and do it. This left eye of mine
is itching to battle. Convene the commando unit
immediately!

 Have the main regiment
run through their formations!

 Make sure the medical units
are well supplied

 with medical ninja tools!

 Contact Ao and the Sensory unit.
Have them hurry!

 Tsuchikage, these were finished
while you were away.

 Take it.

 ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES
PART 4 To shine bright is youth, Lee! I understand, Guy Sensei! But how can I shine even brighter? Oh, I know! Guy Sensei,
I'm even more shiny today! Yes, your hair is so shiny! But this is just superficial brightness! This is true brightness! Whoa! That's just too dazzling! I can make eggs
sunny-side up too! It's so good! You guys want some? – No thanks!
– No thanks! Tune in again

 I can't believe it. I know. I never knew that
Lord Tsuchikage could be so crazy. Damn it... I'm going to strain
my back again! Are you sure about this? Wouldn't it be better to
go by sea? Also, we don't have to fly
so high, do we? Don't be ridiculous, Akatsuchi! That giant snake might
sense us again! We're almost there. ASSEMBLE!
ALLIED SHINOBI FORCES!

 The world flipped over again. What's happening on
this island anyway? Captain Yamato went to check
what's going on outside, but he hasn't come back. Don't you think
something happened? We're already looking into that. You don't have to worry about it. My mission here is done! I'm going back to
the Hidden Leaf Village to wait for Sasuke! He and I...made an oath. Not yet? Not yet. Just sit still. The next time you use your eyes, you'll see a completely
different world. This is going to be fun! I could care less about your war. The one who will destroy
the Hidden Leaf will be me. Anko, please rest a little.
You've been working nonstop. War is at our doorstep. So we have to gather as
much intel as possible. Especially if our intel
can save our comrades. They're here! You're kidding, right?! The white snake that
crawled in earlier... That chakra...is Kabuto's. This is the hideout, after all. I sent my insects to investigate. They've sensed significant
signs of life underground. Tokuma, down below!
Towards four o'clock! Your Hyuga Byakugan will be able
to perceive what's down there! Please, Tokuma! Byakugan! Th-This is... What do you see, Tokuma?! Ranka! Prepare to contact
Headquarters! So many of them... How come the animals get
to go outside, but I can't?! Impatient Naruto...
Haste makes waste... You still haven't mastered
Tailed Beast Chakra control. So your training,
I shall personally patrol... When we we're done, Tailed Beast Chakra will feel
like an extension of you... They'll feel like your arms and legs,
it's true... Yeaaahh! Whoa... With your Tailed Beast Chakra...
Catch them! Stack 'em up like building blocks... Using your chakra and
the Tailed Beast's... Balance those rocks! He took the bait!
Nice work, Bee! Try it out. All right. I have to use
the Nine Tails' chakra, right? I have to stack up these rocks
so that they don't tumble, right? All right! I'll do it! Don't be reckless there.
Your control is fair. But you don't have
fine-tuned control. He pulverized the rock.
Is it too hard to grasp? Damn it! One more time! Gently...this time... More gently... Put spirit in...leave power out. All right! Don't get all satisfied with just one...
Or you'll never get done! The first one is always easy... The next one is key and
it won't go so breezy. Great, Bee! This will buy us
plenty of time. The time has come. It seems that old Fence Sitter
brought them here safely. We'll hide Turtle Island along
with Bee and the Nine Tails at the rear of our headquarters. Any objections, Princess Tsunade? Fine. I will go and
welcome Lord Tsuchikage. Don't fall. Stay put...stay put. – That was so close!
– Damn it! – Turtle Island just shook.
– One more time! Does that mean we've reached
our destination? We're finally here, old man! Ouch! My back! That's because you overdid it! Welcome back, Lord Tsuchikage. So what is the situation? Both the Eight and
Nine Tails are fine. But the Wood User that was
guarding the Nine Tails was taken. Taken? Not taken down? Then the enemy will learn
everything about us! At any rate,
I'll go over the details inside! Will you hurry up and start
making Zetsu stronger? Before that, extracting intel
from Yamato takes priority. But please don't kill him. If you want Zetsu and
the others to get stronger. I could use the jutsu of
the Ningendo's Rinnegan... and easily extract the intel. But that would kill him. So it's better to keep him alive
to make Zetsu stronger? Yes. Poison, huh? So that's how he's suppressing
the power of the Wood Style. Damn that Kabuto. He has researched the cells of
the First Hashirama quite thoroughly. It's a drug I made to
curtail Hashirama's power. Don't worry,
I won't use it on the Zetsu. Without a doubt,
he cultivated all those Zetsu from Hashirama's cells. If he were to use this poison
on them... That Orochimaru... He really looked deep
into our organization. I can't move. Damn it! I can't even execute
my own decisions like this! At this rate... Damn it! Forgive me, everyone! We don't need the power
of the Rinnegan. With my truth serum... and your Sharingan, we can
glean all the intel we want. If we learn who the enemy is, we can strike them by sending out
their worst enemy. There's no need to waste chakra. SEALED Huh?! That's the Hidden Leaf's! It must be new intel! Retrieve it! The X marks the enemy's hideout. It's known as
the Mountain Graveyard. If we go by land,
we'll pass through the Hidden Steam Village and
the Hidden Frost Village. Advise both nations that possess the Steam
and the Frost villages to evacuate! According to reports by
the Infiltration and Recon Unit, the enemy is roughly
100,000 strong. When one considers mobilizing
a regiment of that size, I think only a fraction of them
will come by sea. We'll be in a bind
if they surround us. Then it'll all comes down to
who makes the first move! Convene the Ambush Unit immediately! Have the main regiment run
through their formations! Yes sir! Make sure the Medical Unit
is well supplied with medical ninja tools! Shikaku, help the Intel Unit check
their chain of communication. Roger. Contact Ao and the Sensory Unit.
Have them hurry! Y-Yes. Tsuchikage, these were finished
while you were away. Oh! So they're done! Take it. SHINOBI



Headbands for
the Allied Shinobi Forces, eh? Nice work! I came up with the design. Former enemies who once
battled each other are now one shinobi force! Furthermore, shinobi and samurai
have joined together. The time is near! – Next!
– Yes! I am Kankuro of the Sand, appointed captain of
the Ambush Unit. Kankuro, you say? What should be your nickname? Huh?! Is that wise? Naming someone so young
the captain... What if...what if... Because of his inexperience,
he messes up and panics and forces me to become
the acting captain… Oh man, what'll I do?! The headbands have been distributed! Medical supplies have been checked! Provisions have been checked! Who is in charge of the livestock?! A pig's escaped! The Captain is here!
Everyone, fall in! My name is Shizune and
I have been named to lead this unit. Good to meet you all. First, there is something I want
all of you to remember. This one is not food! You're Inoichi, right? And you are? I'm Tenga! I've heard
so much about you! Please let me put you
on videotape and... I'm sorry I'm late. I heard...
What a rough time you had, Aoba. Yes, Yamato was... But put that out of your mind now. We, the Intel Unit, will oversee all communication
between units. Intel must be transmitted
accurately and quickly! In order to do that,
we must maintain calm at all times, no matter what we hear! Understand?! – Yes!
– Yes! A war, huh? Your name was Cee, right?
Is this your first war?! Yes... We are the "eyes" of
the Allied Shinobi Force. Our unit's performance can greatly
change the tide of battle. Stay focused and alert. I understand, Captain Ao! Everyone, don't let down
your guard! – Yes sir!
– Yes sir! I heard they were going to
split us up into five units. So I figured they'd group us
by village. That's not going to happen.
This is a war. He's right. This is no time to be competing
with other villages! Yeah... The main regiment is
made up of five units, each specializing in warfare. The First Company:
Mid-Range Battle Unit comprised of shinobi who excel
in mid-distance combat. Made up mostly of shinobi
who are weapons users. The Second Company:
Close-Range Battle Unit specializes in close combat. The shinobi of this unit will be fighting
on the front lines. The Third Company:
Intermediate-Range Battle Unit will be stationed to provide support
up close and at mid-range. To be part of this unit, one must have
speed and physical strength. This is the Fourth Company:
Long-Range Battle Unit. We will provide the link with
the Intel Unit to support the front lines. In addition,
we must act as the shield for the support units
behind the lines. And finally, the Fifth Company:
Special-Range Battle Unit with their specialized ninjutsu
and attack tactics! A Special Unit? Yes... In war, anything can happen. Even if we're broken up
into units, it's wishful thinking to believe that each team will operate
without a hitch. Depending on the situation, some units will
find themselves in good battlefield position, while others will be at
a disadvantage. This is where we'll rely
on the shinobi who possess secret ninjutsu. Can't say that all preparations
have been made, but considering roughly
80,000 shinobi have been organized into units this quickly... You've got to hand it to the brains
behind the Hidden Leaf, Shikaku Nara. You'd better not embarrass your dad. So the war is about to begin. Captains! The captain of the First Company, known as the Raikage's
right-hand man, Darui of the Hidden Cloud. The captain of the Second Company,
Kitsuchi of the Hidden Rock. The captain of The Third Company
is Kakashi. The captain of The Fifth Company
is General Mifune of the Land of Iron. And… the captain of
our Fourth Company, and the Commander-in-Chief
of all the battle units... Gaara the Kazekage. It's time. Summoning! Reanimation! First, the former members
of the Akatsuki... Itachi, Sasori, Deidara,
Kakuzu and Nagato. Then the former Jinchuriki... Yugito the Two Tails,
Yagura the Three Tails, Roshi the Four Tails,
Han the Five Tails, Utakata the Six Tails and
Fuu the Seven Tails. And the former Five Kage... The Second Tsuchikage, the Third Raikage,
the Fourth Kazekage... And Explosion Style Gari,
the Demon of the Mist, Zabuza... Ice Style Haku,
Hanzo of the Salamander... Granny Chiyo of the Sand,
Kimimaro of the Kaguya Clan... And from the Hidden Leaf...
Asuma Sarutobi, Dan, Hizashi Hyuga... and a host of others
who had some skill. And that's not all. I used Yamato who has cells
from Hashirama. He adapted quite nicely. 100,000 White Zetsu empowered
by the best ninja of all time. Magnificent! Let's go. The Fourth Great Ninja War... Begins! That look in his eyes...

 It's the same look that
everyone gives me.

 No, it's stronger than that,

 but it's not for me.

 ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES
PART 5 My bodysuit shrank! I don't have anything
to wear today! Oh, that's right! Using a breathing technique
passed down through the ages, I can control the elasticity
of my muscles! All right! – Fight! Fight! Fight!
– Fight! Fight! Fight! AAHHHH!



 Tune in again!

 Wha—?! Wha—?! Wha—?! What is this?! How terrible! Who did this?! Naruto Uzumaki,
at your service! I'm going to become the Hokage,
no matter what! Hey! Come back! You won't get away with this! Damn it!
It was him again! He's made a big mess. Even if we want to file a complaint, he doesn't have any parents
we can complain to! What'll we do?
Who's going to pay for all this? Who do we complain to? Was it him again? Yes, the boy whose name is taboo. What a nuisance. – He's so unpleasant.
– I'll say. He's such a pain. I'm leaving! You forgot something! Oops! What did you make us
for lunch? Did you put in omelets? Yes, I put in lots. – Yes!
– Yes! Be careful now! – Okay!
– Okay! Can I come in? This is for this month's living expenses. Spend it wisely now. Hey… Hmm? Why don't I have a mom and dad? Didn't I tell you before? Although it was
quite some time ago… That's not what I want to hear! You're talking about
when that beast called the Nine Tailed Fox Spirit
ran amuck, right? And that a lot of people
in the village were killed, including my mom and dad… Well, that's not
what I'm asking about! I just want to know… Who were my parents? What kind of people were they? There's no use asking about that. It won't bring the dead back. MEETING

 Now then,
for the next lesson. Instead of just
introducing yourselves, I want you to demonstrate
your ninjutsu skills. So, we'll try a basic jutsu.
The Clone Jutsu. First up is Sasuke Uchiha. Try it out. Uchiha? As in the Uchiha Clan? Yes, he's an elite among the elites. You always act so smug
and I can't stand it! Brag, after you prove it. I intend to. When did you—?! Well done. With this jutsu,
if you attack the real one—! It's useless. – What an idiot.
– So pitiful. Damn it! I'm gonna pulverize him today
for sure… Ya know! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it! Oh man! Oh man! Even Choji?! Damn it! Definitely today! Definitely today! Definitely today! Next, Naruto Uzumaki. And… Sasuke Uchiha! Sasuke! Do your best, Sasuke! You're totally going to win! Damn it! Why does he always
get the attention? I'm not going to lose! Start! Amazing! He's so cool! Sasuke, you're terrific! This guy… That look in his eyes… It's the same look that
everyone gives me. No… It's stronger than that. But… But it's not for me… He pisses me off! Hey! Not him again! You rascal! Damn it, where did he go?! Over there! Serves you right! I acted like the older brother
you desired… in order to measure your vessel. Did you hear? Everyone in the Uchiha Clan
was killed. Yeah, I know.
I heard my dad talking about it. He's the only one who survived. Starting from today,
I get to wear this! Perfect! All right, I'm a genin from today! Let's see, we'll start with
the introductions. I'll go! I'll go! I'm Naruto Uzumaki! I love instant ramen. But I love the ramen at Ichiraku that Iruka Sensei treats me to
even more! And I hate having to wait
three minutes after pouring in the hot water. My future dream is…
to surpass the Hokage! And that's why I'm going to make everyone in the village
acknowledge me! Any hobbies? Playing pranks. Next. My name is Sasuke Uchiha. There are lots of things I hate. And not many things I like. Also, I have no intention of
saying I have a dream, but I do have an ambition. That is to… kill a certain man one day. That's it for the introductions. We start our mission tomorrow. What kind of mission? There is something just the four of us
are going to do. What? What? A survival exercise. I'll be your opponent,
but it won't just be an exercise. This is an extremely difficult test
that has a 66% failure rate. Sasuke, let's walk home together! No thanks. I'm finally a genin and I have no intention
on getting dropped. I'm going to train alone. I guess you're right. Putting on airs! All right! If Sasuke's going to train,
so will I! I'm not going to lose to him! Here I come, Kakashi Sensei! I'm going to be a genin,
no matter what! Damn it… Of all people,
I had to get stuck with Sakura and that loser
in the three-man cell. I can pass, even by myself. I have a goal. Okay, the clock's been
set to 12 o'clock. There are two bells here. Your task is to take these bells away
from me by noon. The one who fails to take
a bell gets no lunch. And failing the exercise means
failing the mission. In other words, at the very least, one of you will be returning
to the Academy. Ready… Start! I'm just going to go for it,
like I always do! That loser. MAKE-OUT PARADISE I'm gonna pulverize him! Damn it! This…This wasn't supposed to… Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Why should I steal a stupid bell? I can hide and eat right now! Thank you for the food! Hey. I was just joking. Too late! If you three had worked together,
you might have gotten the bell. This exercise was devised
to break up the team and see what you would do. Well, guys, I'm going to give
you one more chance. However, the afternoon
scramble for the bells will be much more difficult. If you accept the challenge,
eat your lunch. However, don't let Naruto eat. Huh? That's your punishment for
breaking the rule and attempting to eat lunch alone. If you give Naruto any food, you will be immediately
disqualified. I am the law here. Understand? Like I care if I don't get to eat.
I don't need any food! To steal a bell from Kakashi… As much as I hate to admit it,
I can't do it alone. What should I do…? Combine the strength
of three into one… Here… H-Hey Sasuke! Didn't you hear
what Sensei said?! It's all right. He's not around. The three of us will go and
get the bell this afternoon. It will be trouble
if he hinders me, so… Sakura! Thank you! You pass. In the ninja world,
those who break the rules are scum. But those who abandon their friends,
are worse than scum. That ends the survival exercise. You all pass. Okay, picture time. Look sharp! Why do I have to be in
the same picture as this guy?! That's what I'd like to know,
you loser! Say that again! Come on, guys.
This is a tradition. Team 7 will start its mission tomorrow! What?! The first one! Kakashi Sensei! The second one! A-Amazing! Kakashi Sensei
was using a Substitution… I-I couldn't do a thing. Yet he… It's our first real combat situation… yet wasn't he scared at all? He looked like nothing
was happening, and didn't even get
his clothes dirty… and he saved me? Hey… Are you hurt, scaredy cat? Why're we so different? How come I'm always the one…? Damn it! I'll never let myself get
into a situation where I need to be rescued. And I won't get scared
or run away. I swear it on the pain
of this left hand! If you don't want to
owe me anything,

 you should just get stronger
than me, you loser.

 Damn it! I'll catch up to you and
surpass you in strength!

 Next on Naruto Shippuden: "Rivals"

 RIVALS
When did he
get this strong? RIVALS

 Tune in again!

 Why're we so different? How come I'm always the one…? Damn it! I'll never let myself get
into a situation where I need to be rescued. And I won't get scared
or run away. I swear it…on the pain
of this left hand. Damn it… It's because you're so impulsive. He's such a nuisance. Why that—! Sasuke, what did you just say? If you act up again,
I'm going to make you stop! Sakura… Your teamwork has been
questionable lately. Yeah, you're absolutely right! If the teamwork is off,
it's your fault, Sasuke! You're always showing off! Speak for yourself, you loser! If you don't want to owe
me anything, get stronger! Damn it… Damn it! I'm going to make him admit
that I'm a worthy rival! I'm gonna catch up to him
in no time… and become stronger than him! Take that and that,
and that, and that…! Hey! Be quiet! What time do you think it is?! I'm sorry! RIVALS

 ENTRY FORBIDDEN RESTRICTED ZONE All right! I'm going to start explaining
the second exam to you. Simply put, it's an extreme test
of survival. A no-holds-barred,
contest for the scroll! The Heaven Scroll and
the Earth Scroll. You will fight to obtain
one or the other. There are 78 of you,
in 26 teams. Half the teams, or 13,
will be given Heaven Scrolls. The other half will be
given Earth Scrolls. Each team will have
one of the scrolls. The objective is… to take possession
of both scrolls and make it to the central tower
as a team. I see… So none of us
can drop out. It'll be a test of our teamwork
as a three-man squad. This is the day
I'll pay Sasuke back! All right! Let's go! Sasuke, are you all right? We have to get away quickly,
or we'll be discovered. How do we make our escape?
How do we get away? Sasuke is so shaken up. I've never seen him like this. Sasuke, a snake! I was so distracted;
I didn't even notice the snake. Stay away! You mustn't let your guard down,
not even for a second. When you're the prey,
you become extremely tense before the predator. Sorry, Sasuke… I forgot the password. Naruto! You may think
you're paying me back by coming here to rescue me… But mind your own business! This is way out of your league! His coming here doesn't help
the situation at all. What do I do? There's no other way! I'll give you the scroll. So please, take it and go. What?! Sasuke! Have you gone crazy?! What's the point in giving
the enemy the scroll?! I see… Well, in order to
escape a predator, the only choice the prey has
in order to save himself, is to offer the predator
another prey. Take it! You jerk! Stop interfering! Don't you understand
the situation?! What the hell are you doing?! I forgot the password. So there's no way
I can confirm it. But you're a fake Sasuke,
aren't you?! You loser… I'm the real one! Don't lie! The Sasuke I know isn't as stupid
and cowardly as you are! I don't know how strong
this guy is. But where's the guarantee
that he'll let us go after we give him the scroll?! You're the one who doesn't
understand the situation because you're too scared! Naruto… You are right. A scroll can be easily… Obtained by killing for it. Quit joking around! Stop it! Get out of here, Naruto. Summoning Jutsu! Naruto! Naruto! For now, stay put. Damn it! Take this! That's Naruto? This brat…impossible! This is getting interesting. Sasuke, you're next! What will you do?! Hey, are you hurt, scaredy cat? Naruto… Hey, are you hurt, scaredy cat? The Sasuke standing there
scared and weak is not the one I know! I have to survive so I can kill
my older brother. That's what I used to think. But it seems I overlooked
something crucial. If I can't risk my life here, how can I ever hope to defeat my brother? I can't go on. Sakura! Are you all right? It seems we stumbled into
an enthusiastic welcome. They're here. Perfect amount for a handicap. There's quite a few. And…they're clones. You're trapped like rats. Shut up! Who are these guys? I'll see through them! Sharingan! Naruto! Watch out! What are you doing?! Damn it! It's useless! Forget it! They're illusions! Genjutsu created by the enemy! But Kabuto's wound is real. No, Sasuke is right. No doubt, the enemy is
hiding somewhere and attacking from
a different location coordinating their
"Genjutsu Shinobi" attack. And they're making us think that these Genjutsu Shinobi are
the ones who are attacking. Then I'll find the jerk that's hiding
and throwing the kunai and kick his butt! The real enemy won't appear
until we're completely immobilized. For now, we have no choice
but to defend ourselves against their attacks! Well then, if we crush
these illusions all at once, they'll go back normal. And the enemy won't be able
to throw their kunai knives. We'll find out
where they're hiding. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clones! Damn it! Damn it! We've worn them down. All that remains are
just their bodies. Lucky! You really gave me a hard time. You're the one who hurt
my left shoulder, right? It's time for payback! You're trapped like rats. It worked, Naruto. Impossible, when did… Stupid! You jerks finally came out! This kid…no way. The Shadow Clones were
just props. So that I could pretend to
be the entire team by myself! At the same time that Naruto
released his Shadow Clones, the three of us went into hiding. You Genjutsu users just got
a taste of your own medicine. Now, it's our… Naruto, you used up
too much chakra! I'll take care of the rest! Yeah right. Like I'm going
to let you take over and steal the spotlight. Is this really the Naruto I know? What is with this amount
of chakra? Right after his Multi Shadow
Clone Jutsu, he had the skill to transform
three of them into us. And he can still move. This is the fifth day. Congratulations on passing
Stage Two of the exams. And now, Lord Hokage will explain
the third part of the exam. When did he grow so strong? Without him, we wouldn't
have made it out of the Forest of Death. I can't ignore him anymore. Please stop this. I'm afraid. You're in no condition
to fight right now. Shut up. I know. I know that you've been
in a lot of pain. Sasuke! Just mind your own business. Sakura, I told you once before. I am an avenger! This is not just a test for me. And it has nothing to do with
becoming a chunin. Am I strong?
That is the only answer I seek. The only thing I want is to fight
those who are strong. And they happen to be right here. So I won't let even you stop me. Why you!
Why are you putting on airs? Sakura is so worried about— Naruto… I want to fight you too. Hey… So you've finally come. Kakashi! Make me stronger! This determination of Sasuke's… He's dead serious. Naruto got to
that level so quickly. I can't waste any time. I see, so that's what it is. He finally took notice of
Naruto's immense power. I have a goal. I want more power. That's fine. Sasuke, you know about
the Change in Chakra Nature of the five types of chakra,
don't you? Yeah… The Uchiha Clan possesses
the Fire Nature and specializes in the Fire Style. Why are you bringing that up now? There are superior shinobi
who possess more than two
Change in Chakra Natures. My Change in Chakra Nature
is lightning. Sasuke, for a long time, I have sensed that
you are similar to me. I want to verify what
your Change in Chakra Nature is. I may be able to pass on
my jutsu to you. The one-of-a-kind jutsu of
Kakashi the Copy Ninja. What happened to the next match? Where is Uchiha? Anyway, what is that idiot doing? Isn't he here yet?! Sorry we're late! Your name? Sasuke…Uchiha. Sasuke… You're really late! I thought you chickened out
and weren't coming! It's too early to celebrate,
you loser. Judging from that smirk
on your face, I guess you won your first match? Damn right! Oh well, we made such
a grand entrance. Sasuke hasn't been disqualified,
has he? Not at all. We pushed
Sasuke's match until later. He's not disqualified. That's good news. I'm glad! Don't lose to someone like that! I know… I want to fight you too. Sasuke! I want to fight you too. Yeah… I knew nothing.

 I didn't know that Naruto fought
Orochimaru and the others.

 Or that he learned a new jutsu.

 Or that he's gotten even stronger.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Rift"

 RIFT

 Naruto, fight me now!

 Tune in again!

 How strong am I? You are weak! You are naïve. Shut up… Because your hatred is weak. Shut up! The power of hatred is
the power to kill! The power to kill is
the power of revenge! Your hatred is weaker than mine! Enough! Sasuke! Damn it! Naruto, Sakura…
You two get out of here! I lost everything once… I don't want to see the friends I cherish
die right before my eyes. I was helpless. Na-Ru-To! 2K Uzumaki… Barrage! Naruto keeps growing
unbelievably strong. I can tell just by watching him. He has some kind of
enormous power inside him… And once in a while,
it even makes me scared. How…? How can I become strong? How can I get my revenge? RIFT

 He's returned to the village?! But he's after Naruto? What's going on?! It's been a long time, Sasuke. Huh? Itachi Uchiha… I will… kill you! Oh…the Sharingan. Just who is he? My little brother. I had heard that the Uchiha Clan
had been annihilated…by you. So this is the man
Sasuke was talking about… The one he wants to kill! There is no value in killing you now,
my foolish little brother. If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me, and survive in obscurity. Run… Keep running and cling to life. It's just as you've said. I've hated you and resented you. For the singular purpose
of killing you… I have lived my life! Sasuke! Damn it! Maybe I should cut off those arms! Master Jiraiya… So your target is Naruto, after all? To take Naruto is the overriding mission
we have been assigned by the Akatsuki. I can't let you have Naruto. I wonder about that… Perfect timing. I will get rid of
both of you right here. Don't interfere. If anyone is going to kill him, it will be me. I have no interest in you right now. Sasuke! Damn it! Naruto! I said not to interfere! This is my fight! Revenge… Fine! Why? I haven't closed the gap at all. What is this difference? I've trained for so long,
just to kill him. For so long! What have I been doing
all this time?! Just what…? You are weak. From now, for 24 hours… Go back to that day. That's enough… outta you! Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap. Too bad, Itachi…Kisame. You are in my belly now! I've summoned the digestive tract
of the Giant Toad of Mount Myoboku. You are wanted criminals anyway. I'll just feed you to the rock toad. You are weak
because you don't have enough… hatred. Come, Kisame! Damn! Wait! Why you—! No one's ever escaped
this jutsu before! What's the matter, hey?! They're gone! Sasuke! Sasuke! Are you all right, Sasuke?! Sasuke! Damn it! What's going on? What did that guy do to him?! It's Itachi's Sharingan. He used his visual prowess to
weaken his will to attack. He's hurt quite badly. Sasuke… I guess we'll just have to find her. Tsunade, the Queen
of Slugs and Elixirs, who's a Sannin like me. Hang in there, Sasuke. I swear I'll find this Tsunade
who can heal you. What is it? Pervy Sage,
why did they come after me? It's not you they're after,
but what's inside of you. Just what is this thing anyway? This thing's a monster that attacked
Hidden Leaf Village, right? That's why everyone's so scared. So why would they want
something like that? It's a fact the Nine Tails
has appeared, and caused havoc, generation after generation
at critical points in history. That's why people have feared
this apparition as a natural disaster. Perhaps they feel that if you have the Nine Tails
sealed inside you, they want to have its power
under their control. It's a nuisance to have them
coming after you relentlessly. But that's your fate.
And I am here to protect you. Then… Then I'd better not waste time
and get strong quickly! Where am I? Good, you're out of the woods. I…? Sasuke! Sasuke you…! You're pretty thoughtful, aren't you? I didn't do anything! You're a good friend. You are weak… because you don't have enough… hatred. Sasuke, have some apples. Sasuke? W-What is it? Naruto, fight me now. Huh?! What're you saying?
You're not even completely healed! I don't care. Just fight me! And you think you're helping me? The Fifth Hokage or whatever… She should've minded
her own business! What?! Sasuke, what's wrong? Naruto, do something… Sure, this is perfect. I've wanted to fight you. What is this I'm feeling? I feel tightness in my gut… and something thrilling… What's so funny? I'm not laughing. I'm happy… Just thinking about how
I'm gonna get to beat you. What? To take Naruto is
the overriding mission we have been assigned
by the Akatsuki. Losers shouldn't ramble. I'm not a loser that gets in
everyone's way anymore. I have no interest
in you right now. Why you loser! Don't act so high and mighty! Aren't you supposed to be cool? Quit making such a fuss. Or maybe, you're a little scared
and regret challenging me, Sasuke? Come on! Before that, put your headband on. I don't need that thing. Just do it! I'm saying this is a testament to fighting on equal terms
as Leaf Ninja. That's exactly why I'm saying
you're acting high and mighty! No, he's already… Do you really think
that we're equals? Can I keep up with him? Yeah, I do! No, I don't. I've never once thought that
I was inferior to you! You're what I strive to be! You're an embarrassment! I have to stop! That's because
you're still weak, Little Sasuke! I have to stop! Naruto! Sasuke! Stop it! You jerk! Stop it, you two! Damn! I can't stop completely! What are you guys doing
up on the roof of the hospital? You two went a bit too far
just for a fight. Sasuke, why are you standing
there gloating? The size of that Chidori
was not the size you would aim at a comrade
from the Leaf Village. Did you intend to kill Naruto, Sasuke? That hole! What happened?! Naruto, how far will you go? Was it you who taught him
that technique? Even if it were a means
to resist the Akatsuki, to think that you would
teach Naruto the Rasengan. If he slipped up,
he would have killed Sasuke. Right back at you… That Chidori was also
considerably risky. But I didn't think
Naruto was the kind of kid who'd fire that jutsu
at his comrade. To Naruto, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time. Well, someone he considers an equal. Most likely, he couldn't take
Sasuke's cheap provocations. He's been chasing him
since the Academy days. For him, it's neither
you nor me now. More than anyone,
he wants to be recognized by Sasuke. On the other side of the coin, Sasuke feels the speed of
Naruto's growth at close range and feels inferior. Naruto has gotten strong. To the extent that he thinks
he isn't growing at all. Revenge, huh? I wonder if Itachi is
the one frustrating him. That's why Sasuke doesn't
want to acknowledge Naruto. If he acknowledges him, he might deny himself
up to this point… Rivalry is a difficult thing. On top of which, they are both
burdened by a dark past. One that neither had control over. Damn it… Damn it! We're the Sound Ninja Four. We're here on orders
from Lord Orochimaru. I'm in a bad mood right now. If you want to fight, just know
that I won't go easy on you. You stop your babbling, weakling. He called me…weak? Hey, come over here. I'm going to play do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
on your ribs until they crack. Are you saying that Orochimaru
left a Curse Mark on Sasuke's body? Yes. He said, "Sasuke will come to me
without fail, in search of power." I see. I didn't know such
a thing happened. Orochimaru… I ran into him again
a little while back. What?! He was one of the Sannin and he's ridiculously strong
and dangerous. But, everything will be okay! Sasuke wouldn't fall for
that guy's enticement. He's already really powerful, so he doesn't need to do
that kind of thing! I guarantee it! Come with us. If you do,
Lord Orochimaru will give you power. What is your goal? Are you and your comrades
just going to comfort each other in a mundane village like this and
try to forget all about Itachi Uchiha? Don't forget your goal. A village like this does nothing
more than shackle you! Just cut your stupid bond
with this place. If you do that, you'll be able
to obtain amazing power. Don't forget your goal. My goal is to kill Itachi! For that, I need power! I might have been the only one
who considered us friends.

 But it can't be helped…

 I don't know, but…

 I just don't want Orochimaru
to take you away!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Parting"

 PARTING

I'm definitely
bringing you back! PARTING


 Tune in again!

<i>I can't carelessly approach him
like this.</i> <i>What intense heat and flames.</i> One and a half minutes left. Yes. Die, Grandma! Eat this! You wish! Just as I thought. You attached a Chakra thread
in the middle of that fight, huh? But the same trick won't work twice! How unfortunate. <i>There's no time...</i> <i>Puppet Fight: 10 vs. 100!


</i> What's the matter...?
Aren't you going to attack? <i>The effects of the antidote
will last one more minute...</i> Then... <i>Water?</i> Sakura! Get away! There! How long do you intend
to run about? <i>Twenty seconds left.</i> If that's how it's going to be... <i>Fifteen seconds...left...</i> Are you okay, Sakura?! Die! Granny Chiyo! <i>The antidote is working!</i> <i>If I can just endure the pain...</i> <i>Your efforts are futile.</i> <i>Five seconds left!</i> <i>Four seconds.</i> You little--! <i>Sakura?!</i> Cha! <i>Three seconds.</i> <i>Two!</i> Scorpion <i>We were able to beat him</i> <i>exactly within the sustained duration
of the antidote...</i> We did it. Granny Chiyo, we did it! Sakura... You... <i>That kid...has totally calmed down...</i> <i>What's he planning?</i> Kakashi Sensei!
Aren't you ready yet?! Hold your horses... I don't have as much Chakra
as you, after all... It's going to take time. Scorpion What did you do? That's right. The fight is just beginning. This is a Jutsu I myself sealed... I didn't think I'd ever use it again... But it seems it won't work out
that way. Now let's put an end to this. It's said the ability of
a puppet master is measured by the number of puppets they can use... I'd expect no less from you, Grandma. Th-There's so many... Ten of them. Granny Chiyo's secret
"Number of Fingers." I'd heard rumors about it... The device you used to bring down
a castle by yourself... The Secret White Move:
Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets. The ten masterpieces by Monzaemon, the first Puppeteer of
the Puppet Master Jutsu... It's a great collection of puppets. However... I... used this to bring down a nation! <i>He's become...this powerful...</i> I'm appalled at myself. How long am I going to have to fight
a little girl and an old bag...? I never thought I'd have to
bring out my final device... Secret Red Move: Performance
of a Hundred Puppets... I'll show you... Sakura... The effects of
your antidote have worn off. Stay out of this. You should already know... my personality! That's right... You've inherited
Tsunade's personality as well. But let's make this the final act. Are you ready? Yes! Here he comes! Three Treasures Suction Crush! <i>With this many of them...</i> <i>The surefire way to lessen
the number</i> <i>is to fight them one-on-one somehow...</i> All right! <i>There are too many of them!</i> Are you okay, Sakura?! I'm okay! Stay sharp! Right! <i>There definitely aren't
as many of Sasori's puppets now...</i> <i>But conversely,</i> <i>it looks like he's concentrating
more on each puppet now.</i> <i>And on top of that,
we only have one antidote left.</i> <i>Things will get tough in a hurry
if either Sakura or I get wounded.</i> Granny Chiyo! <i>Oh no...!</i> Are you okay, Granny Chiyo? You don't need to worry about me! More importantly, aim for Sasori. I'll keep the other puppets in check! Right! Sakura, use that! Here! We did it! You can't move. That seal completely
suppresses all Chakra. You can't use
your Chakra threads anymore. It's over, Sasori... Granny Chiyo! Use the antidote quickly! She was quick-witted
from the very beginning... And she was super cute... She was way too beautiful!
She was my youth! Despite her character,
she had her good points... You're right... To think she'd pass away
so soon like this... Lee, cry into my arms! Guy Sensei! Please watch over us... I'll never forget about you, Sakura--! Cut it out, all of you!
This is discouraging! Next time:
"Impossible Dream" We were waiting for you, Sasuke. It had already been decided that
you would be our leader the moment you left the village. Please forgive
our rudeness up to now. I don't care about any of that. Let's go! This is the beginning! Naruto! Hey, Naruto! Shikamaru? Sasuke's left the village. He's headed for Orochimaru's. What?! You're lying right? There is a strong possibility that those under Orochimaru
are guiding Sasuke. Our mission is to bring him back. Give me a minute!
I'll change right away! Well, there are five of us,
and a dog. All right! Let's get going! Before that, I want to tell you
the most important thing. Sasuke and I aren't close friends. In fact, I don't particularly like him. However, he is also a shinobi from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a comrade! Therefore, I will put my life
on the line to help him! That's the way of the Leaf Village. To me, Sasuke is a dear friend. And it's not because
we were together on Team 7. Even before that, I… Sasuke's been our friend
from way back. Yeah… After all, we were
in the same class. I'm certain of one thing:
Sasuke's got talent. And I'm not going to let
the enemy take him away. Everyone! Alll right! Let's get him back,
no matter what! Okay then.
I'll explain the formation. Just you wait, Sasuke. We're gonna rescue you! Sasuke, Lord Orochimaru has
given us one important task. It will be necessary for you
to die once. Die once, you said? Mind Awakening Pills.
Please take these. And after I die? You don't need to worry. That is why we are here. We will use our Barrier Ninjutsu
to suppress the side effects, to ease you away from eternal death
into a state of suspended animation. No matter what happens,
I cannot afford to die yet. I'm in your hands… – Four Black Mists Formation!
– Four Black Mists Formation! Black Seal! All right, we're done with
the first part. You are weak. D-Damn it! PARTING

 Sasuke! Are you running away from me?! Hey loser… Don't concern yourself
with me anymore. Sasuke… What's with that look? Why…? Tell me why, Sasuke! Why did you turn out like this?! What I've become is
none of your business! I walk my own path. And I'm not obligated
to listen to anyone, no matter who it is! "Not obligated"? Let me make it clear! I'm done fooling around with
you guys from the Hidden Leaf. So go home! Choji…Neji…Kiba…
Shikamaru…Bushy Brows… We all put our lives on the line
to come after you. You wasted your time! What did you say?!
Everyone fought for your sake! Choji… He's mine!
I will take care of him! Choji, you're not going to…? Shikamaru, take everyone and go! What are you saying?! He's not the kind of guy
you can handle on your own! Why did we all come together
on this mission? If we lose track of Sasuke now,
we'll end up like he said… A stupid captain and his losers. Choji, you better catch up
with us later. Yeah. Let's go, everyone! I'm going to get rid
of you quick, and get rid of those guys too! Choji! Go, everyone! Neji… Go! I'll take care of this. Apparently this guy's stronger
than the fatso before. And a whole lot more. If we're not prepared to proceed
with "one kill per person," then our plan's not going
to work out. That's what we talked
about earlier right? Yeah, that's right. Plus, we won't be able to
catch up with Sasuke if we stall here. Naruto. Your eyes are better than mine. Sasuke is now in the darkness. Hurry up and go!
I'll catch up with you! Gotcha! Okay! Let's go! You and Choji better catch up
with us later! Think I'm gonna let them get away?! Kiba, Shikamaru… Here you go! Nice! Kiba! Shikamaru! Just as calculated! Punks! You trash! Messing around with us. Naruto! Shikamaru!
Let's get out of here! I won't let you get away! They're faster than I expected. Akamaru! Come quick after
you've set the bombs! Don't you bark at me, you mutt! Akamaru! Kiba! Akamaru! Damn it… You punks! We have no choice. I'll take care of this, so you take the coffin
and go on ahead! Shikamaru… Get going already! Kimimaro?! You were taking too long, Tayuya. Why are you…? I understand this feeling
a bit more now… of being information-carrying energy that has escaped
the prison of human flesh. The feeling of experiencing
a taste of Lord Orochimaru's dream. Orochimaru! This vessel is an important vessel
for his dream. You jerk! Quit babbling nonsense! Give Sasuke back! I leave those two pieces
of garbage to you. Naruto, you go after Kimimaro. Shikamaru? I'll take care of things here. Bushy Brows… It's about time… I've waited so long. The first step…
in Lord Orochimaru's ambition… Sasuke… Sasuke! What're you doing
with these guys?! Come on! We're going home! Sasuke… You can hear
my voice, can't you?! Wait, Sasuke! It's futile. Die. Leaf Hurricane… Who are you? Leaf Village's Blue Beast resurrected!
Rock Lee! Bushy Brows? How did you…? More importantly, Naruto,
go get Sasuke! Please leave this person to me! Everyone…everyone calls you
a friend and…! Sasuke! Sasuke! What do you consider your comrades?! Wake up already! I woke up a long time ago… from my stupidity that dreamed about a peaceful future
together with my comrades. Did you think I'd get stronger
staying with comrades like that? That's why I left the village and
why I'm going to Orochimaru. He just wants your body for a vessel! That doesn't matter to me. My dream is not in the future! My dream is in the past.
That's the only place it exists. Naruto…You can't possibly understand. I dream of exacting revenge
against my own kin. You are someone
who could be able to use Mangekyo Sharingan
just like me. However, on one condition… You must kill…
your closest friend… Itachi, if it's to kill you, I will forge ahead,
no matter how dark the path. No matter what happens,
I will obtain power. Neji, it's just like you said. it looks like he's in the depths
of darkness right now. He really hit me at full power!
Damn it! Yeah, I meant to kill you. Don't you consider me
your comrade any longer?! Don't all those things
we did together on Team 7 mean anything to you?! It wasn't meaningless… To me, you've become
my closest friend. Then why…? All the more reason why there's meaning in
taking you down! I don't fully understand, but I guess you're trying to
take me down for real, Sasuke! Chidori! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan! Sasuke actually came out
and said that I'm his friend. And that's exactly
the reason why I wanted to verify it
using this Rasengan. Damn it! That loser was able to counter my fully powered up Chidori
to that extent?! There's no mistake about this. You really intend to kill me. You're really trying to
kill me, Sasuke. I thought…we were friends. I might have been the only one
who thought that we were friends. It's too late now. Mangekyo Sharingan… To kill my closest friend. What is this red chakra? Sasuke! I'm not gonna let
Orochimaru take you away! I will stop you, even if I have to break
every one of your limbs! What the hell are you?! Your friend! Come on! Wake up, already! If you don't come to your senses, I'll break you so that
you can't move and I'll take you home that way! Shut up… Why the hell do
you think you understand? You have no parents or siblings! What makes you think that you can
understand anything about me?! You've been alone from the start! It's because I have the ties
that I feel this agony. How could you
possibly understand what it feels like to lose all that?! It's true that I can't
understand how it feels to really have parents or brothers… But when I'm with you… I wonder if having a brother
feels something like that. Why? Why is it that you go
to this extent for me? For me, it's a bond that
I've finally been able to have! That's why I'm gonna stop you. A bond… That's true, Naruto. I felt it from the very beginning too. Come on, Naruto! In that case,
I just have to cut that bond! Cut it, huh? Then why did you put on
your headband at this point? I'll acknowledge you.
You're strong. And the reason is because you're someone who knows
the pain of solitude like I do… and that pain makes people stronger. And for that very reason,
by cutting that bond, I will be able to obtain
even greater strength. I will fight you now
on equal terms. However… You won't even be able to
make a scratch on my forehead. That's something that
won't change in the least. It seems that whatever I say won't
have any effect anymore, huh, Sasuke? I'm done with talking. From here on out, we only fight. Come! Hurry! This is bad! The Medical Corps! Please tend to him first. Are you all right? I'm okay.
Look after the others. I wonder if Naruto caught up to him? Please let me get there in time! Hey Naruto, how about we bring
this fight to a close? – Rasengan!
– Chidori! Naruto…I'm… an avenger. Kakashi Sensei… You're awake! Where's Sasuke? So he's gone. I'm sorry, Sakura. I've been waiting for you, Sasuke. I'm glad you came. I want power. Yes, of course. Just follow me. Itachi… I will get my hands on power,
by my own way! I will surpass you, my own way! I'll never give up on you, Sasuke. We're friends. Now and forever… The Akatsuki army led
by Madara

 with their Reanimated Shinobi and
White Zetsu troops number 100,000.

 The opposing army with Gaara leading
the Allied Shinobi Forces

 comprised of the Five Hidden Villages
and the samurai,

 number 80,000.

 The Fourth Great War
is about to begin.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"For My Friend"

 FOR MY FRIEND

I want
to protect Naruto! FOR MY FRIEND


 Tune in again!

 MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: GAARA

 So…Who's our captain?




 So…Who's our captain?

FIRST COMPANY:
MID-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

 That spacey looking
guy over there.

 FIRST COMPANY CAPTAIN:
DARUI

 I-I'm starting to feel nervous.




 I-I'm starting to feel nervous.

SECOND COMPANY:
CLOSE-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

 In war, stay calm…
and composed!

 Hold on…my dad's Captain?!

 It's finally time!




 It's finally time!

SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN:
KITSUCHI

 With Kurotsuchi beside me,
I'll turn the tide of battle!

SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN:
KITSUCHI

 Are you all right, Guy Sensei? The fighting hasn't started!
What did you do?




 The fighting hasn't started!
What did you do?

THIRD COMPANY:
INTERMEDIATE-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

 THIRD COMPANY CAPTAIN:
HATAKE KAKASHI

 I'd better eat while I still can!

FOURTH COMPANY:
LONG-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

 Gaara is the captain of
our Fourth Company, but he's also
the commander-in-chief. As his deputy, you're essentially
the captain of the Fourth Company. Stay sharp! What a bothersome assignment! COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND
FOURTH COMPANY CAPTAIN: GAARA

 Maybe I'll make a name for myself
in this war and become the Hokage!

FIFTH COMPANY:
SPECIAL BATTLE UNIT

 You fool…
Don't make light of war! We have to avoid showing off. You don't have to worry
about that, Shino… FIFTH COMPANY CAPTAIN:
MIFUNE

 Now then, Gaara. You are the commander-in-chief. Please address everyone
when you're ready. For My Friend

 They're on the move! And there's a large
amount of them. Join up with the main forces
and inform them of this! I will remain here and
investigate the hideout! It's too dangerous by yourself! Quiet! Just go! I'm aware of the risks! But if we don't get word to them, our comrades will be
in greater danger! Zabuza… I know…
This isn't the next plane. I'm totally conscious,
yet my body is moving on its own. This is the Forbidden Jutsu…
the Reanimation Jutsu. Someone summoned us
back to this world. It means we're going to be
fighting from now on. Someone's taking advantage
of dead people, eh… I don't like being used
by any such person! You will be our Commando Unit. Go by air! Sasori and Deidara will lay traps
and conduct enemy raids. Chukichi of the Hidden Mist and
the Leaf Foundation Ninja, your job will be sensory intel
and support. What is…this? You guys are with the Akatsuki. Let me make this clear.
If you try to control us… If Akatsuki has to rely on a wimp
like that to order us around, they sure have fallen
on hard times. Not only that, the only survivor
is Zetsu and Tobi, the one who replaced me… You're quite brash for
being dead my good man. And you used to insist that
eternal beauty is art… Hmmm! And it's all because
of that humongous weak spot stuck
on your chest, hmm! Deidara, do you want me
to kill you? I'm already dead.
And so are you, hmm. Is this really going to work? There are too many
reanimated shinobi and it's difficult to
control them all. Right now, I'm just focusing
on the mobilization. Ultimately,
I will direct everything. When the fighting begins,
I will erase their personalities and turn them into
killing machines. There's no need to worry. Of course, it will depend
on their characteristics. Sometimes, it's better
not to change them. Leaving their sentiments intact
will cause the enemy turmoil… We'll aim for that weakness. Aren't you Master Dan? Yes… What we share in common
is that we're dead. We have been resurrected
by a Forbidden Jutsu… summoned to inhabit
the bodies of living sacrifices. What is going on anyway? I have a bad feeling… Aren't you taking
Two-toned Zetsu? I'm leaving Zetsu to keep
an eye on Sasuke. I wouldn't put it past you
to look for the chance to take him away
during the battle. I'm having the 100,000 White Zetsu
travel underground… Such a large army would
only attract attention. Then we shall set out too. Now then, first… Forgive us, Captain Anko! Please stay alive! This sensation…
is it Orochimaru?! No, it's not! – Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes!
– Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes! Just because you
have a Curse Mark, you think you're like
Lord Orochimaru, Anko Mitarashi! I could say the same about you! Have you taken over as
the leader, Kabuto Yakushi?! Taijutsu from a bookworm
will not work on me! Wha—?! I have no intention of
fighting you with taijutsu. I'm a bookworm. Poison? Me?
With all antibodies that I have? So who is the lord now? The antibody that
Lord Orochimaru developed will not work against
this poison. It's…over…there… Kabuto was right. At two o'clock…I see three. What's wrong? Muta! Ranka! You two, hurry on! I will stall them! The intel! Get the intel to Headquarters! Can a young man manage as
the Commander-in-Chief? Lord Gaara is not your
average young man! How dare you make such
ignorant assumptions! How am I supposed to know? Until recently,
we were on opposite sides! Right back at you! It's not like we trust you either! So watch what you say! To be honest,
I feel the same way. Right! Huh?
What did you just say, Hoheto? Even if Orochimaru
deceived them, the Sand were behind the plot
to crush the Hidden Leaf. If it weren't for them,
Lord Hiruzen would still… Look… We were lucky enough to
be named to the Commando Unit… Things are just about to start… I know that! I'm a shinobi too! I'm not about to oppose what our nation and village
have decided… That was just
my personal opinion! You Hidden Leaf
don't have the right… A rogue ninja from the Hidden Leaf
attacked Lord Killer Bee, as well as the Five Hokage
at their summit! Are you willing to
take responsibility for the loss of
Lord Raikage's left hand? What?! No one completely trusts
each other yet. It can't be helped. After years on opposing sides, you can't expect them
to bond in a day or two. Especially the Sand
and the Stone. – Why you—!
– You jerk! That's why the Hidden Stone are… Hey you from the Hidden Mist! What did you just say? Since you overheard me,
what the heck. I said that the Hidden Stone are
ruffians who ignore protocol! What did you say? We have not forgotten
the Hidden Stone's treachery in the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass! Yosuga Pass? You're bringing up ancient history. We agreed to this unit's formation
to honor Ganryu, who wished for peace
from his solitary prison. But the Mist and Stone
can never become allies! You Leaf bastard! Want to do something about it,
Hidden Cloud?! You're gonna betray us
again anyway, right, Hidden Stone? Are the Mist just all talk? If you have a complaint,
say it with your fists! You're the one who needs to
watch what he says! What?! Wanna fight? Sure! You Sand killed my father! I'd be glad to kill you right here! Hey, stop! Huh?! In the name of gain and profit
for one's nation and village… Shinobi have hated and hurt
each other for many years, from the First to the Third
Great Ninja Wars. That hatred cried out for power,
and thus, I was born. In the past, I too was
hatred and power… I was a Jinchuriki. And I hated this world
and the humans in it and thought about
destroying them. This is exactly what the Akatsuki
is trying to do now. However…a single shinobi from
the Hidden Leaf stopped me. I know how you feel so well…
I know it hurts. Gaara… Naruto… Putting us through
all this trouble! He cried for me, his enemy! We wounded each other in battle
but he called me his friend! He saved me! We were enemies,
but we were both Jinchuriki… When we share and
experience the same pain, there can be no bad blood! No one is an enemy here! Because we all bear the pain of
having been hurt by the Akatsuki. The Sand… The Stone… The Leaf… The Mist… The Cloud are no more! Now, there is only… …shinobi! If you still cannot
forgive the Sand, after this war is over,
you can have my head! The look in everyone's faces
has changed. The enemy is now after
my friend who saved me! If he falls into enemy hands,
this world is finished! I want to protect my friend! And I want to protect this world! But I am much too young, too inexperienced to
protect this world! So I beg you all to
lend me your strength! You got it, Lord Gaara! Sorry about that… No… I was wrong too. Sorry… I said too much. I apologize too. Ganryu! How did you? It's time for all
shinobi who have felt the same pain
to come together. I was told that my help
would be welcome, if I held no grudges. It means this war
is so important that they'll accept help from
even someone like me. We are all one shinobi… Yeah. Let's be one and
beat some Akatsuki! Damn right! Uh-uh! The more passionate they are, the stronger the bond
that is forged… Right, Gaara? You have to hand it
to Lord Gaara! Lord Gaara! You've become
a fine man… Gaara! So now, we're all comrades. It's a nuisance, but I guess we
have to learn all their scents! The reputation of
the Inuzuka nose is on the line. All who feel as I do!
Follow me! I did it! Not bad. Next up is the final lesson. Sad, but true,
it's hard to proceed… But we must move forward
with the deed. BACKUP MEDICAL UNIT

 SENSORY UNIT

 COMMANDO UNIT

 The Fourth Great Ninja War… We will win! That goes without saying! We will! We will unite as one and
fight until our last breath… for the sake of our friend
and this world! We're already in enemy territory.

 Omoi! Go set
Paper Bomb traps.

 Sai, you'll be on
aerial surveillance.

 Ittan, use Earth Style to
make a trench.

 Tango, set up a Chakra
Communication antenna!

 Zaji and Hoheto! You two will
be on sensory and watch duty.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
War Begins

 This is war.
Never let your guard down.

                                        WAR BEGINS


 WAR BEGINS


 Tune in again!

 I really didn't want to
experience war in my lifetime. What if… What if we suddenly come
under a surprise attack and I'm the sole survivor… and…I'm captured and tortured? And then, after that… What if the enemy messes
around inside my head… and I'm forced to fight Karui
and Lord Raikage? Omoi! Hey, Omoi! Are you listening? We're going to descend now into the airspace above
enemy territory. Stay alert! Sir… Can I ask you something? What is it? You and I aren't too far apart
in age, Captain. This is your first war, right? Yeah… Are you nervous? Listen up! The outcome of this war
will depend on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness
our Commando Unit. The number of casualties
also depends on us too. Think only about success! If you want to protect
your family and friends! War Begins!

 And how should we evacuate? Continue heading south from
the Land of Steam into Hidden Leaf territory. The north will likely
become a battlefield. Hey, someone… Yes, my lord. It's taking quite long. Please be patient for
just a while longer. They've been bombing indiscriminately
with the detonating clay. We have to put more distance
between us! They're still coming after us. I'll increase the power
of the jutsu. You irritating bugs, hmm! Stop hiding all over the place.
Such a pain. The insects are disrupting
my sensory chakra. It's a jamming jutsu using insects. They're good enough to be
an infiltration and reconnaissance unit. However, don't underestimate
this artful duo! If they're attacking with insects,
we'll answer with this. They are swarming! I got separated from Ranka… I'm counting on you. I must join up
with the main regiment. Gather round. We're in enemy territory. We're going to set up
a base camp here. And we'll conduct surprise attacks
and set traps! Keep a ten-meter radius! The exit points will be at
two and six o'clock! Omoi! Lay traps of Paper Bombs
in every other direction. Right… Sai! Continue aerial surveillance! Roger. Ittan, create trenches with
your Earth Style! Will do. Tango, put up the antenna for
the Chakra Communications. Right. Zaji and Hoheto, you two will be
on sensory and watch duty. Got it. Kiri and I will review
our plan of action. Understood. Well, you've got me,
a Sensory Type, so you can all relax. Never let down your guard
in times of war, Zaji! It can cost you your life. Stay focused. I know. I may not look it, but I was picked for
this unit because of my elite skills. So anything else
we should be wary about? Kabuto uses one
of Orochimaru's ninjutsu known as the Reanimation Jutsu. According to the reports, corpses are brought back to life,
their souls held in bondage. And they cannot be killed,
no matter how many times you attack. Jutsu to seal the souls or
stop their movements seems to be the only solution. Furthermore, even if we manage
to kill the jutsu user… the jutsu itself can't be broken. The goal of every unit will be
to find Kabuto and restrain him. After that, we will break
his troublesome jutsu with genjutsu. That's what I understand. First Company, with me! This is a jamming jutsu. What's wrong? I can't sense for sure because
of a jamming jutsu, but… Something's coming. Is it the enemy?! That's Muta!
I can tell by his chakra. The one from the Aburame Clan who was with
the reconnaissance unit. Hey, wait! It's booby trapped out there.
I'll bring him back. That guy! Muta, are you all right? Hoheto! I know. Byakugan! Get away…from me! The insect bag on his back… They're not insects of
the Aburame Clan! What?! Zaji, get back here! Be careful! They saw through it instantly. Muta! I'm so sorry!
Everyone get out of here. No one can help me. Those movements…
He can't be…! That's why I said to stay alert! He's using Zaji as a shield
and running towards us. W-What'll we do? – Do it, Deidara.
– I know. There's a white clump
that's packed with chakra in the insect bag on Muta's back! That's suspicious! It's got to be one of
Deidara's clay bombs. Ittan, do it! Earth Style: Mobile Core! Now that's art…
The Hidden Leaf in bits and pieces, hmm. Make sure. They're still there. We couldn't save
the guy from the Aburame. Damn it. Kiri, tend to Zaji's wounds. Right. Can't we even take a moment
to mourn our dead in war? Hey, don't move! Here they come again!
Stay alert! We don't even get
some time to think?! What the heck! Cloud Style!
Crescent Moon Slice! They are… Tokuma! Ranka! Our comrades again?! Are they being manipulated?! Again! Above us! Nice, Sai! We're keeping these guys alive. You damn… Now…what will you do, hmm? You're playing dirty. I won't forgive you! Sasori, I know you're there. Come on out. Hmm… You're a puppet master,
after all. You're also a Commando Unit,
I take it. It's unusual for
two Commando Units to engage each other like this. The one who wins here will
succeed in a surprise attack. We started this war. And a victory here will determine
the course of the entire war, hmm! Then we'll win. Is that so? Well, we cannot lose. It's because… we're invincible, hmm! What's wrong? Impossible… Run away, little brother. Our bodies are indestructible. There's no way you can win! Brother Shin. Brother? What an emotional reunion, hmm! They're intentionally pitting people
we know against us? How dirty! Can't waste time feeling anxious. Trying to hurt our comrades…? Well, I won't stand for it! This is war! There's no room
for niceties here, hmm. Hoheto, Tango, go! You're next, Ittan! Deidara, you…! Brother, snap out of it! Nice moves. But even if you make contact,
nothing will happen. I must hand it to
my good man, Sasori. There's no need to
counter this, hmm! Cloud Style: Back Slice! Well done, Omoi! No effect. He pretended to
swing directly at me, but actually slashed back! So stupid! Cutting my chakra thread… What fine swordsmanship. Over here! Ittan, raise us up! Earth Style! Mobile Core! What?! This unit was hastily assembled, but we're pulling
it off quite well! Why you—! It's the first time I've seen you
in that form. Attaching your threads to mine
and reeling me in… Your thread-handling skills
have improved since last time, Kankuro. Frankly, it's nice to get praise from a Red Secret Technique Master. But my Black Secret Technique
is now superior to yours. I never imagined
you'd still be alive. So there was an antidote
to the poison I used the last time. Fate deemed that
I would fight you again. Hold it! I've never forgotten
about that day, not for even a moment. You've got solid talent. However, you picked
the wrong opponent. Your puppets with the hidden
and poisoned weapons… I can see through them all. How? This is the first time
my hidden weapon attacks have been read like this. That's to be expected. Black Ant… Salamander… The one who created
these three puppets is none other than me. Then… you're the celebrated
master craftsman of the puppet unit… Sasori of the Red Sand?! The poison's circulating, huh? I won't finish you. However, that poison will kill you
in less than three days. I owe you one for last time. SASORI Sai, run away.

 I don't want to fight you.

 Brother Shin…

 I don't want to hurt you, so I…

 This jutsu that toys with peoples' lives
and feelings…

 I'll…I'll—!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Sai and Shin"

 SAI AND SHIN

I'll never forgive you! SAI AND SHIN

 Tune in again!

 Fate deemed that I would
fight you again. I owe you one for last time. My own puppet, huh… That body is worthless to me now. Because now, I'm finally a real doll
that will never rot away! This is the body that
I had always wished for! Run… Captain!
The guy from the Foundation… He's got that clay
inside his belly! I once heard that
Deidara's detonating clay is weak against
the Lightning Style. I still have a little… Take Kiri and the injured
behind that rock! Kiri, focus only on healing them! Too slow! Now! Secret Black Technique! Salamander! Brother!  Sai and Shin

 An explosion?! In any case, our reinforcements
will crush the enemy. Zaji! What's happening out there?! It's okay.
I can still read their chakra. Everyone is alive! Owww… We're lucky to be alive. Sai! The Salamander, eh… So he surrounded the bomb with
a defensive puppet he had hidden. Because of that, the blast didn't
have much force, hmm. You called him…a bomb…? You're gonna complain about that? You're trash.
You can never be Sasuke. So shut the hell up, weakling! As long as his soul
clings to this world, I can revive him as much as I want. I'll turn him into another bomb! Brother…Shin… I… don't want to hurt you. I died… and was liberated from
the Foundation. I've heard about the Foundation
of the Hidden Leaf. You're raised together from
the time you are young, like siblings… Then in the end, they pit you against one another
in a death match. It is a training system designed
to destroy your emotions. Where there is no feeling,
there is no doubt. That makes
a truly powerful shinobi. Deep down, you are just like me. Don't act like an artist just
because you can draw a little! Art is an explosion! I think it's time for
another big blast! Just try it! I have a drawing
I want to show you, Brother. Really? Let's see it. What is it? I'm not finished yet… so can you wait a little longer? Secret Black Technique… Damn! I should have just
detonated myself earlier! It's so tacky to exhibit one's
ultimate art over and over! But I guess I have no choice! Hmm! Lightning Style?! Triple Iron Maiden! Nice job, Omoi! I'll use my Puppet Jutsu
and keep these two tied up! Do something about Sai's brother! Right! I knew that if I remained
in the Foundation, I would have to face you in battle. So let's settle now what
we couldn't back then. That's my kunai. I guess I win. I'll bet it collided mid-air
and was knocked off course. I have no luck… Luck is a skill too. It's decided.
You're on meal duty today. Are you all right? Stay away! It's nothing. Okay…then it's okay. Hey… How long has it been
since we came here? Why? I was just wondering if
we're going to keep on living here. You and Lord Danzo are
the only ones I see. So I'm starting to
lose track of time. Not that it matters to me. I want to stay here forever
with you, Brother Shin. That's right. What is this? Open it. It's…a sketchbook. Yeah. You've wanted one for a long time. I bought it the last time
I went into town. Thank you, Brother! I know. I'm going to draw pictures
of you and me in here. Huh? It'll be a picture book that tells
about you and me. Okay. Show it to me when it's finished. Promise me, man to man.
I'm not kidding! Uh-huh! What did you say, Lord Danzo? I'm ordering you two
to fight to the death. That's… This will be your final test. And it is also your fate,
as ones in the Foundation. And after three days,
if you two are still alive and attempt to descend
from this mountain… You will die. Understood? That's impossible…
I can't fight with my own brother. Then…I will kill you! Brother! Are you serious?! Brother! You are much too gentle
to make it out alive. Brother… But you are the one who will live. I'm sick. We must get you treated. It's useless. I've already
looked into my illness. It's incurable. That's…! Lord Danzo doesn't know about this. Report to him that
you dealt with me. I can't… I knew all along that
the final test of the Foundation… is to kill a comrade. Huh?! So I didn't tell you that
I was sick until this day. I tried to live with this secret. So that I could lose to you
in a swordfight. However, I don't even have
enough strength to pull that off. Brother, I also knew that
I would have to fight. But I never expected it to be you… Is that so? You must kill your emotions. Otherwise, duty will destroy you. Now go… And live my share too. Brother… I'm still capable of
ending my own life. Go! Don't cry! Didn't I tell you
to kill your emotions?! I understand. I wish I could have seen…
your finished drawing. Settle that last match…huh? Are you all right, Sai? Sai… I see, so that's your name now. However, it won't happen. Brother… So you finished it. I finally got to see the picture
I longed to see… It's as though… your drawing has freed
my soul from its bindings. Sai, these comrades who
call you by your name… Cherish them. Thank you… What's going on? The strings are slack… Sasori… Sakura told me
how you fight. Back then… The girl who was with Granny Chiyo. Cha! This is a jutsu I personally sealed. I didn't think I'd ever use it again. But it seems it won't
work out that way. Now let's put an end to this! There's so many… I'd expect no less from you, Granny. It's said the number of
 puppets they can use measures the ability of
a puppet master. Granny Chiyo's secret
"Number of Fingers." I'd heard rumors about it. The device you used to
bring down a castle by yourself… The Secret White Move:
Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets. The ten masterpieces by Monzaemon, the first puppeteer of 
the Puppet Master Jutsu. It's a great collection of puppets. However… I used this to bring down a nation… Secret Red Move: Performance
 of a Hundred Puppets! The source of your power
lay in your soul. You once turned yourself into a puppet, and tried to erase your soul,
but you couldn't do it. I can feel it inside this puppet
that you made, where your undying soul dwells inside. But now, you are living flesh, but that's merely a human shell that
has degenerated into a puppet. You were a first-rate
shinobi puppet master. Not some lowlife that allows
someone else to manipulate you. If I'm not mistaken,
you used Kabuto as a spy back then. Now, he's the one using you. It's over when a puppet master
is the one being manipulated! And whether it's you, or Kabuto,
the one who is controlling you… There's no way I'm gonna lose… Because I am the ninja puppet master
of the real Sasori puppet! Your techniques and the puppets
you created will never decay. As long as there are
future puppet masters to inherit the soul that
resides within them! So that is precisely
the true form of art I sought… Quit joking around! My man Sasori! Don't pay any attention to this jerk, hmm! Art is a single flash of light! Art is an explosion! Are you listening, Sasori?! The soul of the creator
resides within, eh… You're right… Kankuro… What is it? I entrust you with the "Father"
and "Mother" puppets. And when you die,
bestow them upon another… Those two are… Yeah…of course, I understand. Hey! My man Sasori! This is a sacrificial victim…
What's going on? I heard that one couldn't die
under the Reanimation Jutsu. Maybe Kabuto released the jutsu? Let me out, you bastard! It doesn't seem that way. – Hey, can't you hear me?
– Sasori is gone, but the loud one is still here. We thought the Reanimation Jutsu
had been perfected, but it seems to have a flaw. It's not that easy to control emotion. Looks like it's over. Nope…this is just the beginning! Sai, Omoi, Zaji! Head out for immediate ambush. – Yes!
– Right! What is it? Oh, nothing. The Reanimation Jutsu… There are still so many
mysteries behind it. But I have a good idea of
how it works now. Madara, head out to the battlefront. I'll hide and focus on the jutsu. This woman… She had gotten
this close to our hideout. And Kabuto was aware of it. So he purposely lured her here? That damned Kabuto… Since the beginning, he's planned for the Allied Shinobi Force
and us to destroy each other. But that won't happen. I'm the one who will use you. Prove to me right now

 that the Reanimation Jutsu
requires living bodies…

 And, you will tell me all of its secrets.

 And if I refuse?

 You will never acquire what
you desire and

 what you desire will become
something else…

 It will be your life!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Secrets of the Reanimation Jutsu"

 SECRETS OF
THE REANIMATION JUTSU

Very well,                                        
I'll explain… SECRETS OF
THE REANIMATION JUTSU


 Tune in again!

 Playing with those building blocks, it's a given I was able to complete it,
at my level now. You're expected to do
something like that. The next one won't be easy,
that's a fact. Oh… So this is connected to that room
where I scrambled with Nine Tails. Take a good look. This time,
it's a statue of the Eight Tails. This is a drag every time! Here's the entrance to another room. For the final Tailed Beast training! Now stop complaining! I'm gonna teach you
the most powerful jutsu for a Jinchuriki. What do you say?
Preparations okay? Right! I have to know how
to control stuff. So? What do I do first? Transform into a Tailed Beast
in Tailed Beast mode! This is number one.
Now it's your turn! Hurry and get it done. Isn't that dangerous? Transforming into a Tailed Beast
is sorta scary. You can do it now, fool, ya fool. 'Cuz you can draw out
pure Tailed Beast chakra. It's not gonna run wild, ya fool! Well then… Visualize your Tailed Beast, ya fool! Can't, huh? Too bad. Well, it's not like you're pals
with the Nine Tails… Anyway, Tailed Beast Transformation
is a dismal failure. So how are you going to teach him
the Tailed Beast Bomb? That's the first trick
a Jinchuriki can use after going into Tailed Beast State, Bee. Man, I'm dead tired. So I used the Nine-Tails' chakra
all for nothing? By the way…shouldn't you tell him that
this Tailed Beast mode is risky? Bee, the risk for you and Naruto
is fundamentally different. Look, I'll explain. Let me out. I hand over the baton
for the mumble jumble Saves me from the verbal fumble… Hey! Naruto! I'm the Eight Tails, not Bee. Now listen carefully
to what I tell you! Man, this is so complicated. But you don't talk in rhymes,
so it's easier to understand. First, I'll go over the risk when you switch
to Tailed Beast chakra mode. Risk? There's a risk to this mode?! Big time! It's very important,
so be quiet and listen. Y-Yeah… Secrets of the Reanimation Jutsu

 The risk when you switch to
Tailed Beast chakra mode… That's…! Yes? NARUTO
NINE-TAILS' CHAKRA
OWN CHAKRA

Basically, when you're in
Tailed Beast chakra mode, NARUTO
NINE-TAILS' CHAKRA
OWN CHAKRA

your own personal Naruto chakra is
being taken by the Nine Tails! Because you momentarily
shelve your own chakra in order to use the Nine Tails' chakra. OWN CHAKRA

So of course, if your own chakra
is emptied out completely… ZERO

you're a goner. Huh?! But how come
Mr. Eight Tails is okay?! Even if you take over
the Nine Tails' chakra, you haven't really tamed him. Bee and I were like that in the past. We competed for each other's chakra. Oh and, you shouldn't
use Shadow Clones when you're in
Tailed Beast chakra mode. Shadow Clones made from
your own chakra will be taken. They'll be gone in an instant,
and you'll die. But my chakra takes the Nine Tails' chakra
that's been leaking and reconstitutes it or whatever…
so I have lots. Fool! Don't underestimate
the Nine Tails! He'll wipe out your chakra! Restoring your stolen
chakra takes time! So be careful! If you get carried away and
use only the Nine Tails' chakra in battle, you'll end up dead. W-Wha…? By rights, you and the Tailed Beast should
negotiate how you both use chakra. But Nine Tails isn't the type to do that. Also, there's a limit to the chakra
you managed to tug out of the Nine Tails. So much risk… And yet, I can't use
a Jinchuriki's ultimate jutsu? Well, forget about
Tailed Beast Bomb. You should just concentrate on
polishing up your special moves. Tailed Beast Bomb?
What kind of jutsu is that? Oh, it's simple. You take your chakra and
change its form… gather it up and compress it… Then just spew it out. Like that time… It's almost like vomiting. I wanna try it in this mode! Like this?! It's impossible without
Tailed Beast Transformation. Anyway, I've explained it all to you. I'm gonna switch with Bee. Oh well, too bad.
It can't be helped. You just have to do your special move
in Tailed Beast chakra mode, is all… Rasengan requires Shadow Clone Jutsu,
so it's not suited to this mode. Chakra release and rotation… plus change in chakra form
and compression… That's a two-person move. Tailed Beast chakra… Your own hands and feet,
that's the sensation. And the real ones, are just an illusion. I see… Maybe like this? Not bad at all. Try that special move of yours.
That move you already have. All right! Rasengan! Huh?! This is…! Change in chakra form with
rotation and compression… That jutsu! It's exactly like the Tailed Beast Bomb,
fool, ya fool! Hey! Naruto! Who taught you that jutsu,
ya dimwit?! Huh?! Well, it was Pervy Sage… I mean, Jiraiya Sensei. But the Fourth Hokage invented it. Fourth Hokage…? What a coincidence.
Or maybe fate? Truly not a shame! Rasengan! The method is exactly the same
as Tailed Beast Bomb. It's exactly the same! Created with
the Tailed Beast Bomb in mind! That's the Rasengan! It's like he entrusted you with
the Tailed Beast Bomb. You couldn't have been luckier. It's easy when you're in
Tailed Beast mode. Change in Chakra Form as
a human is impossible. If you add rotation,
it makes it more plausible. Yeah, but… I can't do it as well as
my usual Rasengan. Tailed Beast chakra is
a combination of positive blue chakra and
negative red chakra. Their ratio is key. During compression, if you change
the red to blue ratio to 2:8, it will become a ball! Try it! Okay! You haven't got it yet. Your red is at 9.5 and blue is 0.5! It looks easy, but it's hard. All of a sudden,
there's talk of positive and negative, red and blue chakra, and numbers… I don't understand this stuff! Besides, this Rasengan is heavy. I have to use both hands
or it'll break apart. I can't be bothered with
all those details. I'm the type that learns
by doing things. So as for this Tailed Beast Rasengan, I'm gonna keep doing it
and doing it… Until I get it right! It's impossible in human form…
it's a tougher toil. Rest a bit. The wounds on your hands
are a type of jutsu recoil. I told you, I can't worry
about the details. Octopops, you said the ratio
should be 8:2. Keep watching me and
tell me when I get it… I want to remember
what that feels like! You sure are a persistent guy. Very well.
I take back what I said. Looks like that woman is still alive. Lord Orochimaru's Curse Mark
has adapted to this woman… His chakra flows through her body now. She can't be killed yet. No, get rid of her now. This woman knows where
the real entrance to our hideout is. I need to extract Lord Orochimaru's chakra
while she is alive and collect it. You might as well call
my body Lord Orochimaru's. It's crucial in order to increase
my own strength. Then my power to bind
the Reanimation Jutsu will increase. And another crucial thing is… This jutsu requires a live human body. That is why this woman is
being kept alive. Increasing our battle strength… Doesn't that further your cause?
Or am I wrong? Today's friend is tomorrow's foe.
That may be so. Your benefit could turn into
my disadvantage. You still don't trust me, do you? What do you want from me? Prove to me right now that the Reanimation Jutsu
really requires living bodies. And…tell me all of its secrets. Including how to stop it! And if I refuse? You will never acquire what
you desire and what you desire will become
something else… It will be your life! It's not wise to take on someone
who uses Rinnegan right now. Well, I still have a hand to play. No need to rush it. Fine… But I don't have any sacrifices here. As I said,
this woman cannot be used. Those people are…? Danzo's dogs. They've been under
a Sharingan-based genjutsu from the time of their capture. You don't go easy, do you? All right, I got things ready for you. I killed this one. Now use this other one and
do the Reanimation Jutsu. Let me say this first. This is categorized as
a type of Summoning Jutsu. I summon the soul of the dead person
from the afterlife to this plane. To achieve that, I need a portion
of the one I want to revive. A fixed portion of flesh. A portion that contains
personal identification material. Without it, the Reanimation Jutsu
will not work. Furthermore, if the soul is
not in the afterlife… Namely, if the soul has been
sealed somewhere else, they cannot be revived. In the past, Lord Orochimaru tried to bring back
the Fourth Hokage and failed. That was because the god of death
had already taken the Hokage's soul with the sealing jutsu,
the Reaper Deal Seal. And the Third Hokage also
used the same jutsu during the destruction of
Hidden Leaf Village. The First and Second Hokage
were taken along too… So that means… Reanimation Jutsu can't be used
on the First through Fourth Hokage? That's right… I've brought many back to life… But it wasn't easy to harvest
their personal information material. It's basically just grave robbing. It's hard to identify decaying bodies… I had a lot of failures. So this is the jutsu formula? This is how you turn a living person
into a vessel for the dead one's soul. Then the Reanimation Jutsu
is complete. Th-This is…?! You can call this jutsu the most powerful jutsu
in the shinobi world. The Second Hokage devised it and
Lord Orochimaru perfected it. It's their greatest legacy
to the world! I control his personality with this tag. And once I assign his orders… All the abilities he had in life will
be restored to this decaying man. And he will become my puppet who
obeys my orders and cannot die. Naturally, even rare abilities like
the Rinnegan of the Six Paths and Itachi's Sharigan. But I could not find
Shisui Uchiha's body anywhere. Jiraiya's body is deep in the ocean where the pressure is too strong
for anyone to venture in. As for weapons like Danzo's right eye
and Pain of the Six Paths, I don't have all the materials
with their personal information. Don't get carried away. Well, no matter. We have more than enough pawns. A jutsu this ideal has to have risks. The most amazing thing
about this jutsu is that… there is no risk for the jutsu user. What? It's true. The Reanimation Jutsu has no risk.
Well, it does have one. Because it is such
an amazing, powerful jutsu, the name of its wielder will spread
to every corner of the world. In name, I will be more famous
than Madara Uchiha. But an academic like me
has no desire for fame. I'll just become a target. Don't get ahead of yourself! There is a reaction to every action. Stay focused. I appreciate your advice. If this jutsu has a risk, it's that I've given you information
about it. Well, I must be going. Academics are better suited
to be in gloomy places. Hold it! You didn't tell me how to stop
the Reanimation Jutsu yet. Oh! That's right. I almost forgot. Killing the jutsu user
won't stop this jutsu. So what do you do? It's quite easy really. You manipulate me, the one
who controls the Reanimation Jutsu… into breaking the jutsu by weaving
the signs…dog, horse and tiger. With your Sharingan, for instance. Otherwise, you can seal away the souls of those under
the Reanimation Jutsu. That's fine and good, if it's true. I'm not brave enough to lie to you. Anyway, this conversation is over. I've told you how to stop it. I'm going. As long as I have that other jutsu
along with the Reanimation Jutsu, I am invincible. In time, I will unravel the truth
of the Sage of Six Paths. Is White Zetsu's spore tailing him? Of course. Then Black Zetsu, you can start
preparations for that other thing. Understood. I would have missed this
without Muta Aburame's intel. A large army is
approaching underground! We're going to widen our scope! They're going to try to pass
right under us! Are they planning to take
the rear of the Allied Force? Use Earth Style and dig them up! Notify Kitsuchi immediately. Intel Unit! Get word about it to
Kitsuchi immediately! 
 INTEL UNIT SQUAD 1

It's coming! All right! New intel.
INTEL UNIT SQUAD 2 Finally.
INTEL UNIT SQUAD 2 MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT,
SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN KITSUCHI Enemy, roughly 20,000.
Coordinates: 25 by 30, underground!
MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT,
SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN KITSUCHI So that's how they're coming. Reinforcements… The Reanimation Jutsu… It's more refined than the one
the Second Hokage Tobirama used. To control this many souls
at one time… It's quite a feat. Kiba! Shino! That was fast, Kiba. I was told to join you here! Is the enemy near? – Earth Style! Erupt!
– Earth Style! Erupt! So this is neither
heaven nor hell. You shouldn't be here… Mister Kakashi,
please stop us again! I'm already dead. I died human! Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"An Old Nemesis Returns" Yeah, I know.
AN OLD NEMESIS RETURNS AN OLD NEMESIS RETURNS Tune in again! Captain Mifune! We received a message
from Headquarters! The enemy force is passing through
directly under us, deep underground! Our shinobi in the Sensory Unit
couldn't detect them? They must not be human. All right! Considering our Fifth Company's
elongated deployment, I'll send in several platoons DARUI-FIRST COMPANY
MIFUNE-FIFTH COMPANY
GAARA-FOURTH COMPANY
KANKURO-COMMANDO UNIT
KAKASHI-THIRD COMPANY
closest in proximity to Kitsuchi and
his Second Company as reinforcements! Make haste! I'm going to keep releasing them! Zaji, take care of the signal fire! Right! Red smoke,
that's the Commando Unit. Hurry! Right. Are you all right,
Master Zabuza? Looks like we wasted a jutsu, Haku. This Reanimation Jutsu revives the dead,
but they can't be killed. I don't like this jutsu… You did well to detect them, Haku. That species of giant bird
generally fly in pairs. They work together to
catch their prey. However, that's only
during the winter when they are raising their young… And that looks like a beacon
made to look like a cloud. No doubt, the enemy
that attacked is over there. Leave this to me. Lightning? A cold air? Secret Jutsu Crystal Ice Mirrors! Owww… H-Hey… That thing… What? They're just kids. We can't die. So we can just strike. They are Kekkei Genkai shinobi! I'm different. We bear no grudge against you. We're just not in control
of our actions. They're coming! Kakashi? An Old Nemesis Returns


 An Old Nemesis Returns

Kakashi!
You're a lifesaver! Don't start celebrating yet. These guys are all pesky shinobi. I knew we would have to fight, but I never imaged it would
be against you, Kakashi. Lightning Blade! That day on the bridge, you were supposed to finish me off
and send me to hell. When I came to,
I was in the same place as Haku. It seems this is neither heaven nor hell. This is the world of the living. You are under the Reanimation Jutsu. Reanimation Jutsu? That's right. The Akatsuki brought you back
from the world of the dead. What? He knows them? Wait for Captain Kakashi's signal. Zabuza… Haku… Oh… You've matured, Kakashi's kunoichi. How is that kid? Huh? Uh-huh… Who're you? Hey! Hey! Is this the one
I should pick? Uh-huh. This one is the medicinal herb? Thank you for helping me. You've got a lot to do early
in the morning, sis… You too… What've you been doing here
so early? Training! I want to get stronger. Oh? But you already look
strong enough. No, no! I want to get
even stronger! What for? To become the best ninja
in my village! I'm going to get everyone
to recognize my strength! And I have to prove
something to someone! Is that all for someone's sake? Or is it for your own sake? What's so funny?! Do you have somebody
precious in your life? When a person has something precious
they want to protect… that's when they can
truly become strong. I know that well enough too! You'll get strong. I hope we meet again somewhere. Yeah! We lost because of him… He must be all grown up. He's probably famous too. Yeah, that bridge is now called
the Great Naruto Bridge. Everyone in the village calls him
the miraculous hero now. Thanks to you both, Naruto was
able to find his Ninja Way. And he made a pledge at your graves, and he's grown into
a fine shinobi since then. Then he will become even stronger. Were you able to reminisce a little? Because it's time to get serious. Power is welling up! The main act starts now! Kakashi… Stop us… Retreat! Kakashi, these people… I know! There's no doubt! The Demon Zabuza Momochi! And Haku of the Ice Style! Kakashi Sensei! I am your opponent! Haku! Sorry, but this is going to be over
in an instant. Sharingan, eh? Something like that
won't work on me! Ninja Art! Hidden Mist Jutsu! You're mine! This is the Silent Killing, which brings down a foe
only with sound. Why?! You were known as
the demon of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza! How can you stoop so low
and become a mercenary? Don't kid yourself! In the shinobi world,
it's either use or be used. And we shinobi are merely tools! Shinobi don't need ideals! Our world has no use
for weak ninja. Why do you have to serve
a guy like that? I want to protect someone
special to me. I want to make
his dreams come true. Naruto, do you know
how it feels to be unwanted? Master Zabuza needs me. When I was old enough
to understand things, my father tried to kill me. People with Kekkei Genkai were
hated and feared in my homeland. And at that moment,
what I thought of myself was that… my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world. Same with me. Master Zabuza took me in. He wanted me, needed me. I was so happy… I am your weapon, Master Zabuza. Keep me by you as a mere tool
that will heed your every word. But I just don't get it! The only reason you are allowed to live
is because you're strong? I'm losing…consciousness… Damn… The inside of my head…
feels so hot… That demonic aura… So this is the Demon Zabuza! On top of that, the Ice Style child! On guard! Stay alert, Guy! No one comes close to him
in Silent Killing! Kakashi… Please… Stop us once again… My dream was always to
be Master Zabuza's tool and die protecting him… The fact that Master Zabuza is under
the power of this jutsu means… that I was not able to protect him
from you back then. Furthermore, not only am I incapable
of protecting Master Zabuza, I can't even serve as his tool now. No, you protected Zabuza. No, you protected Zabuza. He died for a different reason. And…Zabuza never thought
of you as a tool. K-Kakashi, quit babbling nonsense. Naruto dug deep into Zabuza's heart. He talked big,
and this is how he ends up? What a weakling. Haku! You…! Naruto, don't be reckless. We're outnumbered! But… But…! Enough, kid! He's right.
Haku died because he was weak. What're you saying?! He threw his life away for you! As Gato used me,
I was simply using Haku. I thought I'd told you… In the shinobi world,
it's either use or be used. We shinobi are merely tools. What I wanted was his skills
and not Haku himself. Do you… Do you really mean that? Stop, Naruto! He… He really liked you! Is there someone special in your life? He liked you that much! When a person feels he wants to
protect a person special to him, that person can truly become strong. Even so, don't you feel anything at all?! You really…honestly…
don't feel anything at all? I'd like to make that person's dream
come true. For that, I could completely
become a shinobi. When a person becomes
as strong as you, does that person really
behave like you? He threw his life away for you! He didn't even fulfill
his own dreams and yet… to die as a tool! That's… That's too painful. Kid… Don't say anything more. Haku was… He was hurting inside for you
while he battled you guys too. I know. He was too kind. I'm glad we could fight with you
at the end. Yes, kid, it's as you say, after all. Shinobi are human too. Maybe it's impossible to become
an emotionless tool. It's my loss. Zabuza… You guys stay out of this. This is my fight! Snow… At this time of year? Haku, are you crying? You were always at my side. At the very least,
I can be at your side in the end. If it's possible, I'd like to go to
the same place as you. You will, Zabuza… The two of you together. Zabuza and Haku, huh. They're quite tenacious. I still haven't been able
to bind them completely I'll soon turn you into
mere killing puppets! You are my tools! K-Kakashi, don't hesitate. Use whatever means it takes…
to stop me. I died already. I died human… Yes, I know. Master Zabuza… Thank you. Here they come! Captain Kakashi!
That Hidden Rock shinobi… A user of the Explosion Style
Kekkei Genkai. He's a former Demolitions Unit captain
like Deidara… That's Gari! And that woman is… the Scorch Style Kekkei Genkai user
from the Hidden Sand… Pakura! Please be careful! Kekkei Genkai shinobi…all of them. Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu. The fighting unit will comprise mainly
of sensory-type shinobi! The rest will take a Manji Formation at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock
and provide cover! We will pinpoint Zabuza
using only sound! The mist is becoming thicker. Our field of vision isn't good enough. Sakura, you don't need to be afraid! I will guard you with my life! The last time, they attacked the dead spot
in this formation, the center. Watch your backs! Leave it to me! Huh? O-Oh, right! After the mist…cold air. It's begun! It's different from the last time,
after all. To be able to bind so strongly… As one would expect from
Lord Orochimaru's chakra. To be able to overwrite
my own control tags… However, I purposely kept
their emotions intact to psychologically torment the enemy. That results in a weaker binding and the soul dies when the heart
undergoes a change. This time, I will kill all feeling. Right now, I don't know who among
the enemy pawns I can do this to. I'll just gather data from this war. As for the rest of the pawns, I'll bind them to the point of
obeying my orders, and leave them to their own accord. Some will probably be more beneficial
with their emotions left intact. He was mummified. This jutsu… Here they come! Scorch Style! Super Steam Kill! My insides…! Explosion Style! Land Mine Fist! No way… Tajiki blew up! You bastard! – Leaf Hurricane Whirlwinds!
– Leaf Hurricane Whirlwinds! Guy! Comrades die on the battlefield! That is one thing
you must learn to accept! Losing your cool can cause
even more comrades to die! Place your comrade's death
into the recesses of your mind! Understand, newbie? Y-Yes! Hang in there.
You're going to be all right. I'm beginning to understand how
the enemy is coordinating this. Now it's my turn! I'm not so naïve as to allow
the enemy time to act. – Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu! No way. Don't tell me… This is… The past members of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist! Haku once told me,

 when a person has something precious
they want to protect…

 they can truly become strong.

 Oh really? So do you feel
the same way?

 Yeah, watching Haku and Zabuza
made me feel that way.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The First and Last Opponent"

 THE FIRST AND LAST OPPONENT


I liked those guys. THE FIRST AND LAST OPPONENT


 Tune in again!

 It seems like there are
a lot fewer guards around. We could make a run for it now. Let's look for Sasuke. You go on ahead.
I'm going to look for my blade. I found the key right away, but my blade is
nowhere to be found. They confiscated it, right?
Then look in their armory. Let's go. What? You're going to help me? You're all right, Jugo.
Unlike that Karin. Speaking of which,
where'd she go? Want to look for her? Without her around,
it's a little too quiet… What should we do? I'm beginning to understand
how the enemy is coordinating this. Now it's my turn! I'm not so naïve… as to allow the enemy to act. – Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu! No way. Don't tell me… That's… The past members of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist! Among the legendary
Seven Ninja Swordsmen… they've chosen the strongest ones! The Seven Ninja Swordsmen… Nothing on the Ensui Platoon? They'll be here shortly. Maki of the Hidden Sand,
what about you? We're ready to roll! All right, buy some time
for Ensui's platoon. Everyone, attack together! It's not here either. You said you're gathering all
the lost Hidden Mist Blades. Why are you so obsessed? What? You said you'd help me.
Don't tell me you're giving up? You're the one who gives up. Except when it comes
to the ninja blades. I need one thing to keep me going. Resurrecting
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen and becoming their leader
is my dream. Resurrect? Yeah. Right now, the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen consists of a single brat named Chojuro. Traditionally, the ninja blade is passed down from
generation to generation. Right now, there is only one blade,
known as the Hiramekarei. Nothing else. The great blade, Samehada,
is in Kisame's possession, but he's a rogue ninja. I finally got a hold of
the Executioner's Blade, only to lose it. So officially,
that unit doesn't exist today. For now, anyway… The First and Last Opponent


 The First and Last Opponent


It's no use. No matter how many times we attack,
it has no effect. What do we do against
guys like that? They're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen! The longer we keep this up,
the greater our disadvantage. Don't worry so much! The Reanimation Jutsu
can be stopped by sealing away the soul
or immobilizing their body. And other than Zabuza,
no one is wielding a sword. That cuts their strength in half. No. It seems they brought their swords. Not all of them have one. The mist is getting even thicker… We can't see through this. And there's no sound
with Silent Killing. We can't even hear them. We must do something
about this mist, or the Allied Forces are
at a disadvantage. You have a plan? I'm preparing it now. Then I'll leave you to handle it! Lee! Go after the Scorch Style!
I'll take the Explosion Style! Understood! Captain Kakashi! I'm ready with my Shadow Possession
and Shadow Paralysis! All right, fasten it to me. Ensui, reduce the strength
of the Shadow Possession, and stay focused on my movements. Right! Santa Yamanaka,
use the Mind Transfer Jutsu to trade places with me. With your sensory skills, you will be able to track and
find Zabuza in this mist! Right! Once you perceive Zabuza,
since I'll be under Shadow Possession, guide me to a location
where I can see him. Get me behind him
as close as you can. When I have
a clear sight of him, immediately release
the Mind Transfer Jutsu and return me to my body. I will grapple with Zabuza
and step on his shadow and get him into position. At that point, Ensui,
immediately increase the power of your Shadow Possession
and Shadow Stitching Jutsu and bind him! Then Maki, completely immobilize Zabuza
with your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu! Yes! Let's do this! Right! Mind Transfer Jutsu! We're going to guard
Captain Kakashi! Right! Anyway, there are lots
of other blades. Among the Ninja Swordsmen
throughout history, there were super masters besides
Kisame, Zabuza and Chojuro. First… there's the wielder of
the Lightning Blade, the Fang, a blade swathed with lightning
with the ultimate cutting edge… Ameyuri Ringo. The wielder of… the Blunt Blade, Kabutowari,
that smashes through any defense… Jinin Akebino. The blade that stabs
and pierces everything and sews them together… the Long Blade, the Sewing Needle. Its wielder is
Kushimaru Kuriarare. The blade that adds explosive power
to one's swordsmanship… the Explosive Blade: the Splatter. And its wielder,
Jinpachi Munashi. And the one who,
like Kisame Hoshigaki, wielded the Great Blade, Samehada…
Fuguki Suikazan. And the one who could handle
all seven blades. The one known as the second coming
of the demon, my older brother… Mangetsu Hozuki. And I am going to be the captain
of the new generation of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen, and… Enough. You're talking too loud. Hey, I was coming to the climax. The sword you broke
in two, right? Shouldn't you just make
a new sword? You don't know a thing. That blade has a certain power. The Severing Sword,
the Executioner's Blade, cannot be chipped or nicked. No, a better way to put it is,
the blade repairs itself. It cuts into humans,
then absorbs their blood. It regenerates itself with
the iron present in blood. All right! Found him! Mind Transfer Jutsu, release! Good luck, Captain Kakashi! All right! He hasn't noticed me. I can do this! Splendid, Haku. I didn't expect him to jump in
to save Zabuza. The boy… is already dead. Zabuza's Hidden Mist style is
necessary in order to battle many. So I knew that Zabuza would
be their target. To protect him,
the rest can be mere shields. And Haku will protect Zabuza
with his life. Even though he is simply
a puppet now. It must be quite a performance
out there on the battlefield. He intends to slash me along
with the boy?! Captain Kakashi! Damn it… If we can't hear them or
even see them… Isn't Captain Kakashi here yet?! I put a shadow on one enemy! There hasn't been enough contact
time with the second shadow! I can't stop his movements! Contact time? Don't tell me Zabuza cut down
Captain Kakashi?! Give me another A-rank mission?! No way! Zabuza and Haku… I can't believe everyone
came out unscathed against such strong ninja. Huh… Well, learn more jutsu and train
to become stronger. Then you can tackle
A-rank missions. You're right about learning
more jutsu. But I've also got to find other
things that I want to protect. Haku said to me… when a person has something
precious they want to protect, they can truly become strong I see…
So do you feel the same way? Yeah! After watching Haku and Zabuza,
I started to believe that. Hey, hey… Kakashi Sensei,
what do you think about this? About what? I'm glad you were
Naruto's first adversaries. Maki, stay behind me and stand by with
your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu! Right! Why? Why can't I keep up? Damn it! You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now. What was that?! You still don't realize… Zabuza… That time,
you hesitated killing Haku and you couldn't hide the unrest
in your heart over Haku's death. But it's different this time. You're just a tool
with no feelings. Let's put an end
to a fight like this! Hey, hey… Kakashi Sensei. What do you think about this? About what? Well, those two were enemies… I…liked those guys. Is that weird? No. I feel the same way. Ensui! Bind him! That's my signal! Okay! Shadow Paralysis Jutsu! The way you died and your tears… demonstrated your bond
to each other. I have many things I want
to protect as a shinobi. Zabuza and Haku… Protecting the way they died
is one of those things. Especially since I am
their final enemy. Naruto… What do you think? Now, Maki! Right! Damn it! This is… The mist is clearing… All right!
Now we can see the enemy! If these tags remain,
they cannot be summoned. I will keep an eye on
these two bodies. All right… The Reanimation Jutsu…
This is an unforgivable jutsu! Sai, next we'll use your
Sealing Jutsu from the Foundation! You're up! But…But I still haven't mastered
that jutsu… Isn't it a fact that you were
highly regarded by Danzo? There's no need to suppress
your emotions anymore! Well… It takes me a while
to get upset too… But this time,
my boiling point was low. Copy Ninja Kakashi has copied
a thousand jutsu… And I'm going to use them
to their fullest extent! Attack! Fang Over Fang! Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Sphere! Eight Trigrams Air Palm! Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! Neji! There are too many of them… So they absorb chakra… Gentle Fist Technique…
Body Blow! One after another…
There's no end to them! Stop whining and move! Each one is strong and persistent! This is attrition warfare. Captain Kitsuchi! We have word from Headquarters! Several thousand have
gotten past us! Dad! Quiet! I know! Here they come. Who are these two?!

 They're bathed in
Nine Tails' chakra!

 It's incredible!

 There's no mistake!

 It's the Gold and Silver Brothers
of the Hidden Cloud.

 And even Dan is with them?

 Well, now that it's come
to this,

 I guess I'm the only one
who can face him.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Brilliant Military Advisor
of the Hidden Leaf"

 THE BRILLIANT MILITARY ADVISOR
OF THE HIDDEN LEAF

What should we do? THE BRILLIANT MILITARY ADVISOR
OF THE HIDDEN LEAF


 Tune in again!

 Here they come… Mu is not moving. There's no sign of him
or his chakra. Seems the Second Tsuchikage
has been detected. Even though he was known
as the "Null Man." It will soon be ripe for war. The real fight is just beginning. With that class of shinobi,
I anticipate bigger results by not killing off their
thoughts and emotions. I'll let him do as he pleases
after the Summoning Jutsu. The Brilliant Military Advisor
of the Hidden Leaf

 The Second Tsuchikage… The Third Raikage… The Second Mizukage… The Fourth Kazekage… Too bad we don't have
a Hokage. Still, four Kage from history
are here. I'll just let the Kage and
their progeny kill each other off. Where am I? My, my… What a gathering
of former enemies! Well, well. I don't know this guy. This is a foul jutsu of
the Second Hokage. The dead are summoned back from
the afterlife and then bound. You were summoned here by force. The dead?! What do you mean? Have you forgotten? I killed you myself. You died ages ago,
Second Mizukage. Oh…back then… Hey wait! You also died that day!
In fact, I killed you. Was that so? Well, no matter. Let me continue…
Where was I? Where is the Second Hokage? He's the jutsu user
who resurrected us? I detect someone
several kilometers ahead. One with the same chakra
as this new face… along with a huge army. No doubt you are… I am the Fourth Kazekage. My predecessors have told me
about your exploits. So this means the Sand
has continued through to the fourth,
no, the fifth generation. It feels strange
being in the future. Listen, this is not the future. We're just beings from the past. And don't interrupt me,
or I'll kill you. But I was killed.
And I killed you! I was just telling you the story of the Second Hokage
who resurrected us… The Second Hokage was
long dead by my time. But there was a shinobi capable
of using the Reanimation Jutsu. A shinobi named Orochimaru. Four…and among them… is Father. That's all. It's a message from Headquarters. Our Commando Unit has skirmished
with the enemy's Commando Unit. Our predictions about
the enemy were correct. But they are raising the dead
with a jutsu known as the Reanimation Jutsu and
sending them onto the battlefield. Who knows what kind of shinobi
we'll see on the battlefield. So everyone, be prepared. That's the signal. The enemy is near. But there's no word
from Headquarters that they detected the enemy. What's going on? It probably means there are guys that even Headquarters
cannot sense. After all, the enemy will only
revive the strong ones. We have to fight dead people? What do I do?
I'm getting scared. Hey Choji, now that you're here
it's too late to whine. U-Uh-huh… We just received word from
Captain Gaara's Fourth Company. Four of the enemies have
been spotted. They are the Second Mizukage,
the Second Tsuchikage, the Fourth Kazekage and… And who's the other?! The Third Raikage. What?! My old man too?! Damn the Akatsuki! The numbers don't match up with
our own sensory readings. Are you sure this data is accurate? Princess Tsunade… It's the Second Tsuchikage
that has appeared. Huh?! It's no wonder we
could sense three, but couldn't detect one. The reason sensory detection
was futile is the doing of Lord Mu. There's someone who
can evade detection from even the Headquarters'
Sensory Radar Jutsu?! What is he? Captain Ao! There are far too many
of those white monsters. It's impossible for me to detect the ones with
special characteristics. Darui's First Company
will soon encounter several thousand enemy troops! Please distinguish the white ones from those under
the Reanimation Jutsu! All right! You take charge of
the broad-range scan! Huh?! This is not good! Darui's First Company will
be facing too many who are under
the Reanimation Jutsu! Furthermore,
they're all powerful shinobi! They're coming. Give the signal to get
into position for battle. Right. Right. There are so many… It's not just their numbers. Headquarters was right. I can distinguish the adept ones
with my Byakugan. Lord Hiashi!
Look towards 10 o'clock. Th-That's… N-No way. That can't be… What's wrong? What about them? That's… They're…Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku… What?! These two are bathed
in the Nine Tails' chakra! Incredible chakra! There's no doubt! They are the Gold and Silver
Brothers of the Hidden Cloud. What? Even Dan is among them? The Fourth Company is
facing my old man. And the First Company is looking
at Kinkaku and Ginkaku. Now that it's come to this, I have no choice
but to go out there myself. Please wait… Lord Raikage… You are the Supreme Commander
of the Allied Shinobi Forces! The Supreme Commander must
remain safe in order to give orders to the troops until
the final stages of the war. That is your duty towards
your charges. But an enemy force
of enormous strength is converging
on Darui's First Company! The tide of battle is
like a living thing. It changes second by second. To discern those changes
is why I am here! Bring me the map! First, let us verify
every company's status. At the forefront is
Kankuro's Commando Unit. KANKURO COMMANDO UNIT

And facing the previous Kage
who suddenly appeared… GAARA FOURTH COMPANY


REANIMATED FOUR KAGE


 GAARA FOURTH COMPANY


REANIMATED FOUR KAGE


is Gaara's Fourth Company. We'll call this Battlefield B. When you look at it like this, we seem to be evenly
matched in strength. It's unwise to think that. The ironclad rule of warfare is
to take the advantage by mobilizing troops! ENEMY                         ENEMY
 The enemy advances
from two directions. You counter that by attacking from
one direction with full force. We are dealing with
two battlefields here. A and B… First, we must deal with A. We will concentrate our troops
with Darui's First Company. So, we will deploy
Mifune's Fifth Company in belt formation as support to
reinforce the ranks from the rear. Then we will move Kitsuchi's
Second Company to the side and box the enemy in
from the sea. Kitsuchi's Second Company
may be stretched thin. But, the Fifth Company's deployment
in belt formation will serve as a barrier. Meanwhile, Gaara's Fourth Company
will break up and make a slow retreat to
the opposite side of the village as if to lure the enemy. From there, half of the company
will join up with Darui's First Company
as reinforcements. And after the enemy is crushed
in Battlefield A, Darui's First Company and
Gaara's squads will turn back towards Battlefield B… and the enemy that Gaara's
Fourth Company had kept occupied will be crushed from the rear
all at once. Why start with Battlefield A? If you split
Gaara's Fourth Company into two, won't the enemy seize that
opportunity to attack? Don't underestimate those four. They are former Kage! With Battlefield A, Companies Two
and Five are in close proximity to Battlefield A and
can move quickly. Also, Kitsuchi's Second Company
has engaged the white ones before and is familiar with them. Attacking the white clones
from the rear will ensure a high rate of success. As for the enemy in Battlefield B… The former Kage cannot
launch an attack. If the troops suddenly
break off into two, the enemy will assume we're up
to something and will not charge. The war-savvy former Kage will
not be so foolish as to attack… I see. And even if they were to attack, Gaara's Fourth Company is
a long-range battle unit. They specialize in fighting from
a distance, which means it would take longer to engage them
in a short-distance battle. In other words, it is a company
that could buy us time. What will you do,
Supreme Commander? No wonder we could not
take down the Leaf. You are blessed with
fine shinobi, Tsunade. Save the compliments
for after the war. So? What will you do? All right! Let's do it! Inoichi,
you've been listening, right? I'm already on it. Also… We've already sent word to Mifune
about the Commando Unit. They are on their way. And Shizune is allocating
her people evenly to provide medical attention. A unit resurrected from
the Reanimation Jutsu is part of the army. War is finally beginning. Shikaku is thinking about
strategy at Headquarters. That guy is
an amazingly clear thinker. He comes up with brilliant tactics
that I could never dream up. Oh… And Inoichi will pass that on
to us without fail. I have faith in them and
we will battle right here. Yes! Have faith in our comrades. You're right. We have to hold back the enemy,
for our comrades' sake. Thank you, Choza. All companies have been notified! All right, it's been a while since
Ino-Shika-Cho went into action! I have one question,
Nara from the Hidden Leaf. What is it? In order for your strategy
to be foolproof, you must add in one thing. Which is? The Second Tsuchikage is
no ordinary shinobi. The only one who can stop him
is the old Fence-Sitter. His name has come up often
in our discussions. What kind of shinobi is he? From the time I heard that
his chakra could not be detected, I knew he would be a problem. He is known as
a Kekkei Touta shinobi… which is a considerably higher
level than the Kekkei Genkai. Kekkei Touta?! I thought you, Third Tsuchikage,
were the only one… The Second Tsuchikage too? The ability to activate
the three chakra natures of wind, earth and fire,
all at once. He was my teacher
who taught me the Particle Style. To have to battle my master
at this age… It does not pay
to live a long life. Will you go? Yes. What choice do I have? Nara… Yes? I'm not going just because Lord Mu
of the Particle Style is there. Your tactical plan is brilliant. And while all the resurrected Kage who stand before
the Fourth Company know war, they will not make
unnecessary moves. You are probably right in
your battle assessment. But the opposite is also possible. The one who united
the Allied Forces is Gaara. His youthful passion was
the primary catalyst. And you are saying this can have the opposite effect
on the battlefield? I appreciate your insight. Well then, I guess it's time
to leap into the war and show these young brats
what fighting is all about. Especially that brazen young kid. A jutsu that controls
the Second Hokage's corpse… The user doesn't seem to be
the Second Hokage, but this Reanimation Jutsu… There are times when your body
won't do what you want it to. Movement is restricted. Seems that way. I thought about
killing you earlier, but my body wouldn't let me. I would have enjoyed
battling you all. Such a shame, such a shame… Gaara, eh… I'll show them why
I'm the one guarding the coastline.

 I'll launch the opening shot,
then you all engage! Continue!

 I won't let you pass!

 You didn't need to get up.

 Who's the one
who lifted me up?

 Tune in again!

 I'm beginning to lose my patience
with these shinobi. How long do they intend to keep
us feudal lords cooped up like this? Now, now…
What is the harm? We should decorate them
after the war. What shall we call it? Is this it? How hard the wind blows As we course through
the deep and winding road The smell of the wind reminds me
of the capital… Officials and we feudal lords are used
as hostages in times of war. It is the duty of the shinobi to
guarantee our safety. Which is why I accompany you,
Lord of the Land of Mist. We will reach
your hiding place shortly. Now then, what is a suitable title
for the decoration? Certificate of… Certificate of… Is that the enemy?!
I didn't detect anything! Do not let them get close
to the Feudal Lords! He fell for it! So, this wasn't it. Damn! He got away. Get word to the other hiding place! Stat! Oh! I have the perfect name
for the honor! Land of Fire's Hidden Leaf,
Land of Wind's Hidden Sand, Land of Earth's Hidden Stone,
Land of Water's Hidden Mist, Land of Lightning's Hidden Cloud
Allied Shinobi Decoration! It's too long! The Allied Award will suffice! No, that is much too short. It doesn't sound distinctive enough. Feudal lords are so carefree. What's the fuss over
getting a decoration? That's their job. Don't knock it. If there weren't any medals
and decorations, we wouldn't know what honor is. Someone has to set the standard. Well… I guess so. You don't get decorated
by just thinking about it! Stay alert. It's almost time to move. Feudal Lord of the Land of Frost… We are now headed for
the fifth hiding place. Fifth? Yes… We will be moving you
at fixed intervals to five locations to prevent the enemy
from finding you. Your bodyguards are
all skilled shinobi too. That is reassuring. Yes… They've underestimated me,
Black Zetsu! This land is me! Battleground

 It's drab… But I'll show them why
I'm the one guarding the coastline. I'll launch the opening shot!
Then continue! – Yes sir!
– Yes sir! Lightning Style, Black Panther! Black Lightning! Captain Darui is
the only one authorized by the previous Raikage
to get a lightning tattoo! Sorry about that. Up above! We're not going to allow you
to pass so easily! Keep on going! Don't let them break
through the barricade! Now go! My worst nightmare has come true. This is like… No, this is the Great Ninja War. Choza… What? I see… You're all grown up, Choza. I have still have a lot to grow. Release! Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! Brother… Forgive me… As a member of the branch family,
who should be protecting the main family, I'm standing here now
as your enemy. This must be my punishment for
resenting the main family long ago. My body will not do
what I tell it to. As it is, my decision
to choose death for the sake of the village
has been negated… So please tell Neji. I wasn't killed to protect
the head family. But to protect Neji, my siblings,
family and the land, by my own will, I chose death! This is the fate in store for me, a member of the branch family. There is no such fate! Your son has fought
to demonstrate that! So has my daughter! Neji… And Lady Hinata too… Damn, there's no end to this! Are you all right, Neji?! Yeah… Thanks, Hinata. It's not about
the branch family protecting the bloodline of the main family now. We protect each other
as comrades! That time has actually come to pass? Then Brother… This is all the more reason, by your hand I wish to… Even wild geese know
about formation. That when the leader
becomes confused, the entire flock is put at risk. But I am much too young, too inexperienced to
protect this world! So I beg you all to
lend me your strength! You got it, Lord Gaara! Although it's a fact that
someone young and charismatic must stand at the helm… Hey! All this moving around
is making me sick! Talk about being artless, hmm! Shut up. I'll be happy to seal
that mouth shut too. I'm not into S&M! I'll show you what real art is,
so let me outta here, hmm! Damn it… Ouch! We stopped…hmm. Granny Chiyo… And… Well done, Kankuro. You seem to have stopped Sasori. Hmm? That voice… Hey! If you're here to help,
get me out of here! It's stifling me and
I'm about to explode, hmm! No, you're wrong. You can't explode,
that's the reason you're in there… Explosive Style kid. Oh…well, that's true. Hey, don't put it like that, hmm! Both the Akatsuki and the shinobi of
the Five Great Nations are enemies to me. I have no intention of helping you. I loathe this jutsu. I have no control over my body. The Reanimation Jutsu again… As if Granny Chiyo
isn't dangerous enough, these guys look pretty scary too. It doesn't help that
we split up our fighting force. Listen up. Retreat on my signal. Right. We just got tactical orders
from Headquarters. We're to transmit this
to the front immediately! Get the tactical data
to the captains! Captain Kitsuchi! This just came in from Headquarters!
Tactical orders! All right! Tell me! Got it. Sorry, I just got orders to
take half this company and join up with
the First Company. Half?! Are they out of their minds
at Headquarters?! No, I agree with their strategy. If everything goes according to plan,
things will be okay. And I'll be back. But one thing troubles me. What's the matter, Shikamaru? Supposedly, the enemy has
a Kekkei Touta shinobi that surpasses Kekkei Genkai. Kekkei Touta?!
Are you sure about this? Kekkei Touta? What are they talking about? Do you know, Matsuri? I've never heard of it. But judging from
Temari's shocked reaction… It must be a formidable enemy. You there… How do you expect
to defend yourself against the Kekkei Touta
with so little knowledge?! – F-Forgive me, Temari!
– F-Forgive me, Temari! But exactly what is Kekkei Touta? Damn it, don't you young ones
know anything?! Kekkei Touta is… Kekkei… Touta is…? Shikamaru, tell them! Huh? Why me? I'm not good at these things! You explain! Damn it. I'm the one who's supposed
to give the orders. I want to hear this too, Shikamaru. Well then, I guess I should start
with the properties of chakra. FIRE WIND LIGHTNING EARTH WATER



Generally, we all possess
one chakra nature. EARTH FIRE WIND WATER LIGHTNING



That's besides the nature
you obtain from training. WATER LIGHTNING EARTH WIND FIRE




There are different natures, so the more chakra natures
you have, the better. WATER          WIND
EARTH          FIRE
WIND          LIGHTNING
FIRE          EARTH
WATER          WIND

That's why most jonin possess
multiple chakra natures. I see… I know that much. You'd better. However, there are those born
with two chakra natures, who are able to fuse
the two and create new chakra. They are known as
Kekkei Genkai shinobi. Captain Yamato's Wood Style
is a combination of water and earth. Isn't that right? Yes. And Captain Darui of
the First Company uses a Gale Style that's a combination of
lightning and water chakra. They're all shinobi with
rare jutsu styles. And topping the Kekkai Genkai,
there is the Kekkei Touta in which three chakra natures
are fused. What?! Three? It's almost beyond belief
and extremely rare. In fact, I know of only one among all the shinobi of
the Five Great Nations. Of all the luck, the enemy uses
the Reanimation Jutsu… And they've resurrected
a long-dead Kekkei Touta shinobi who uses something known
as the Particle Style. Mu the Second Tsuchikage. We'd better come up with
a strategy against him. Shikamaru… How can we leave when
there's such a formidable enemy shinobi? Well, it looks like Headquarters
has taken that into consideration. With the appearance of a rare ally
with a Kekkei Touta. You didn't have to bother
stepping up to help. And who was it that didn't stop me? Then let me ask you this. When did you all
forsake yourselves? This is where I take back
my forsaken self!! Super-Expansion Jutsu! This is pitiful… That we're caught in the jutsu
of the Second Hokage whom we've beaten before…
eh, Kinkaku? My apologies for embarrassing you,
Kinkaku and Ginkaku, long revered as
the shining light of the Cloud. Ginkaku, look at his left shoulder. It's the kid who inherited
the Third Raikage's lightning. He seems to have some skill. I don't mean to disrespect you, but I'll have to shame you
some more. I may end up taking the shine
out of your silver and gold… With one strike of my Gale Style! Even though this is drab. I don't like that tone
you're using toward your seniors.

 I'll shut you up!

 Seems like a lot of time has passed.

 No one knows about us anymore.
Let's do this Ginkaku!

 All right, Kinkaku!

 So those are the Gold and
Silver Brother's Ninja Tools!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 FORBIDDEN WORDS

They talk too much.
This is perfect. FORBIDDEN WORDS


 Tune in again!

 My apologies for embarrassing you,
Kinkaku and Ginkaku, long revered as
the shining light of the Cloud. I don't mean to disrespect you, but I'll have to
shame you some more. I may end up taking the shine
out of your silver and gold… With one strike of my Gale Style! Even though this is drab… Calm down, Raikage. You are the Supreme Commander. You just don't know how frightening
the Gold and Silver Brothers are. I can't believe I just heard
you say the word "frightening." It's not that I'm scared… They are the most reviled criminals
in the history of the Hidden Cloud. The brothers staged
a coup d'état during the alliance ceremony
with the Hidden Leaf and attacked the Second Raikage
and Second Hokage. It is said they use four of
the Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths. They left the Second Hokage
near death. I know that much. What?! These two are bathed
in the Nine Tails' chakra! Incredible chakra! The Nine Tails' chakra…
I didn't know they possessed it. Long ago, it seems the Hidden Cloud
made an attempt to capture the Nine Tails… and the Nine Tails
apparently devoured the Gold and Silver Brothers. But the brothers kept
thrashing around in its belly, forcing the Nine Tails
to vomit them. Ever since then, they have been infused
with the Nine Tails' chakra. Not surprising, considering they
were inside the Nine Tails' belly for two weeks. It's hard to believe, but what
about the rumors that they are able to wield the Treasured Tools
of the Sage of Six Paths? Normal humans cannot handle
the Treasured Tools. They absorb massive amounts
of chakra from its user that would kill the average man. Except ones who harbor
the Nine Tails' chakra, like those two monsters. They are shinobi
with monstrous chakra who wreak havoc and fear nothing,
not even the Nine Tails. What scares me is
the thought of our subordinates who must face them… Forbidden Words

 I don't like that tone
you're using toward your seniors. I'll shut you up! It can't be helped. Seems like a lot of time has passed.
No one knows about us anymore. Samui, Atsui. If you're really
the Gold and Silver Brothers we read about in our scrolls, don't talk to me
like we're comrades. It's not cool. Well, well… For someone
who's always cool, you're quite hot right now. I sense that you guys
are pretty formidable. Let's do this, Ginkaku! All right, Kinkaku! What is that?! No doubt about it,
those are the ninja tools of the Gold and Silver Brothers
that were described in the scroll! Four of the five
ultimate ninja tools, which the Hidden Cloud
collected long ago. The Kokinjo binds its victim and squeezes out
the victim's spirit word! The Shichiseiken severs and
curses that spirit word… The Benihisago records
the spirit word and seals the speaker with in! And the Bashosen conjures up
all five chakra natures: fire, water, lightning,
wind and earth! Sorry to interrupt
your lecture, Sis, but… Let me handle this! Cloud Style! Flame Slice! Those ninja tools look nasty, but ultimately,
they're just mere tools! They're no match for our ninjutsu
that's imbued with our hot souls! Atsui, wait! Stay cool until I finish! Damn it! He's too hot-headed! They talk too much…
This is perfect. I'll take the one in the back! Got it, Ginkaku! Leave the others to me! The nerve of the guy…
Avoiding someone like me, with a hot fighting spirit,
to go for Darui! Did you think you could avoid
my hot-spirited attack with a crowd of bodies!? Pay attention, Atsui! Stay cool and look around you! That punch was pretty hot! Damn it! Atsui, Samui! Are you all right? Don't look away, kid! Change places, Kinkaku! Right, Ginkaku. Can't I even stop one foe? Forgive me, Samui, Atsui… Whoa…
I'm your opponent this time! That Kinkaku fellow packed
a pretty hot punch! And this time it's Ginkaku, eh? Squeeze them! Kokinjo! What is that?! The Kokinjo in my left hand
squeezes out the Spirit Word of anyone that touches it! Curse them! Shichiseiken! HOT







COOL
 Record them! Benihisago! All right.
My side is done, Kinkaku. He's been struck… That's what you think, you jerks! It's our turn now! Didn't I tell you to let me finish? Now listen. Don't say another word. What do you mean? A Curse Mark Jutsu and
Sealing Jutsu have been used on us. Our Spirit Words have
been taken hostage. The word we've uttered
the most since our birth. HOT






COOL

If we say that word… We'll be sucked into that gourd
and sealed away. You know a lot, don't you? It seems the passage of time
revealed a lot of things. The word we've said
the most is now forbidden? We're not playing
some silly word game… HOT

COOL

We're not playing
some silly word game… HOT

COOL


So drab… HOT

COOL


 I see. Bashosen! What? What is the hot word I love
to use the most?! You probably don't have
to think too hard to figure it out. Scroll of Fire! Hot! Damn it! Stupid… Atsui! There's an old saying,
"Silence is golden." The mouth is
the source of calamity. Right, Ginkaku? Yeah, Kinkaku! This is what happens when
you can't keep your mouth shut. Words are used to lie. They're merely tools
for deceiving people. If you make fun of words,
Bee will let you have it. Bee? Never heard of him. If you move, the girl dies. And I'm not lying. I'm sorry, Samui. Just as I expected. I must say, you're both
true Hidden Cloud shinobi. Gale Style! Laser Circus! He's fast. And to top it off,
it was a Precision Ninjutsu? Don't take us lightly, brat! Owww… Kinkaku did a good job
of applying the Kokinjo. This one's first. What's going on?! She didn't say a word,
but Samui's been sucked in?! Curse him! Shichiseiken! His arm has already regenerated! Record him, Benihisago! I can figure out what
my forbidden word is. This is drab! That was pretty drab. DRAB DRAB My forbidden word… The word I've used most often in
my life is without a doubt, DRAB

"drab." As long as I don't use it… I won't be sucked into that gourd. However…Samui didn't say a word
but she was sucked in. Which means… If you stay quiet for
a fixed amount of time, you can get sucked in… Am I right? Sharp of you to notice. It seemed no one had
figured that out yet. You're pretty smart. "Silence is golden"? As if… They also say that,
"speech is silver"! Especially when spoken
with a forked tongue! In this case, silence is
the most forbidden taboo. Didn't I tell you? Words are tools with which
to fool others. In the shinobi world, trickery and betrayal are
fine military tactics. The spoken word is also
a ninja tool. Is it any wonder that you two
are symbols of disgrace among the Hidden Cloud? How dare you say that,
you third-rate underling?! You're just another pawn
for the Raikage… A mere ninja tool. A mere ninja tool! So you can cut the drivel! What the hell is wrong
with the ninja of today? Boss… I'm sorry. I was chosen to be your bodyguard
and yet you lost your left arm… Don't worry about it. But… I don't miss my left arm. After all, I have two right arms. Two? This and… you. How about including Cee
and making it three? Well, all right. You can never have too many. I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man… Not some timid rabbit! Hey, Ginkaku… What, Kinkaku?! Get ready for Benihisago. I see. Why? I didn't say "drab." I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man. Not some timid rabbit! I am the Boss's courageous
right-hand man… Not some timid rabbit! Timid rabbit is… Drab! DRAB Damn it! Darui… I want you to be lead one of
the Allied Shinobi companies… as my right-hand man! My apologies, Boss… I was so proud to be
 your right-hand man… My apologies, Samui…Atsui… My apologies, everyone… My apologies… My sincerest apologies… Ready to move on, Ginkaku? Right, Kinkaku. Why?! Damn it! I touched the Kokinjo! Why didn't he…? DRAB APOLOGIES APOLOGIES I… I apologize about the desks
and the wall… My apologies for embarrassing you,
Kinkaku and Ginkaku, long revered as the shining light
of the Cloud. Apologies, Samui… I guess that means
I'm a pretty humble guy. That's not so bad. I'm certain it was "dull." My apologies, Boss. My apologies, everyone… My apologies, Samui…Atsui… I'm so sorry. Don't tell me…
While he was being sucked in, his most-used word switched places
with his second-most uttered word? Curse him! Shichiseiken! Record him! Benihisago! I think that's the way it goes! Why you… This uses up so much…chakra… I feel like I'm gonna drop first. It's true…words can be used
as tools to trick people. But when it really counts,
the spoken word… After all, I have two right arms. This… and you! The spoken word is… is a precious thing that conveys
the truth that's right here. Help me…Kinkaku. KINKAKU

That's why I'm going
to seal you now. Kinkaku! Samui… Atsui… It's all thanks to you. I swear I'll save you later. But now…there's one more. Why you… How dare… How dare you! What?! Hey! Hey! Hey! This is…! How dare you do that
to Ginkaku…?! He looks exactly like
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki! It's a strategy from HQ!

 We'll strike Kinkaku with
the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation.

 Until they get here, we'll have to
hold this location down!

 – All right!
– All right!

 He may have the power
of the Nine Tails,

 but we have the power of
the Ino-Shika-Cho bond!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Golden Bonds"

Sakura! Granny Chiyo! Are you okay? Can you still move? Oh? You're worrying about other people
even with this wound? <i>Sasori... How...?</i> Don't tell me... <i>So that's it.</i> If you're a Medical Ninja, you should understand
the situation you're in. Shut up! You're a courageous girl. But how long can you hold on? <i>She's...stopping the bleeding</i> <i>and healing herself with
a sword stuck in her.</i> <i>She's skilled.</i> Granny Chiyo, I'm okay. So hurry up and
take the antidote. Sakura. It looks like the poison
is starting to take effect. Of course, this sword
is also poisoned, you see. <i>My body's getting numb
from the poison,</i> <i>so I can't control
my Chakra very well.</i> <i>Impossible Dream


</i> <i>So that's the antidote.</i> Why? Granny...Chiyo. <i>I can't believe how everyone chooses
death for the sake of others...</i> <i>How stupid...</i> I won't let go. <i>This girl's got...incredible strength.</i> Granny Chiyo! <i>It's futile to have
a strength contest with her, huh?</i> Then... Die! <i>Wh-What?</i> You lowered your guard
at the end, Sasori. What? Now you can't move. Am I right? Although you may have
the body of a puppet, you use Chakra, so you need
a part that's living... That's your weakness. And just that part from
your left chest is missing from that shell. <i>Here!</i> It was probably right before
the Jutsu was completed. You switched...
to a different puppet. The body of a puppet
is basically just a doll. Your real body... is that chest part that
produces Chakra. Sakura! This is not good. <i>In any event, I've got to
pull out this sword</i> <i>while closing the wound.</i> Hang in there. Just a little more. It's futile. I pierced
a vital point. She'll soon be dead even
without poison. She's lost too much blood. Since you're also
a Medical Ninja, I aimed for a spot
you can't easily heal. I've already finished first-aid treatment
with Medical Ninjutsu. What I'm doing right now
isn't Medical Ninjutsu. What? I'm giving her
my own life energy. Don't tell me... It's a Reanimation Ninjutsu! A Reanimation Ninjutsu. It's a Jutsu I spent years creating
originally for you... one that only I can use. With this Jutsu... life can even be breathed
into puppets. In exchange for the life
of the caster that is... <i>Sasori.</i> But in hindsight, it's a dream
that won't be realized... How stupid... Have a safe trip. It...It can't be...! Damn you...
White Fang of the Leaf! Grandma Chiyo! Are Mom and Dad back? They're not? W-Well, your mom and dad were
suddenly sent on another mission... It looks like they won't be back
for a little while. I just heard from them and they want you to wait
with me for them to return. Can you wait, Sasori? Yeah. How stupid. When did you grow senile, Grandma? Sakura, are you okay? Yes. What about you, Granny Chiyo? That's strange. I thought the caster of that
Reanimation Ninjutsu or whatever was supposed to die in exchange for breathing life
into someone dead. Sakura's wound was severe,
but she wasn't dead... So I got off without
serious injury. That's unfortunate. I'd stop that. This body doesn't
even feel pain. The more you hit me,
the greater the pain in your fist. Women sure like to
do stuff that's pointless. I won't feel anything even if my blood-related grandmother
should die. My heart is just like
this body. Up until now I've killed hundreds,
thousands of people. She'd be the same
as one of them. Things are simpler that way. Just what do you think
a person's life is to you?! What do you think
a relative is to you?! Come on... Is that what
a Shinobi should be saying? Why? Why can you only think
like that...? Sakura... That's enough. But...! It was the evil customs
and teachings of Hidden Sand Village. that made him what he is. Granny Chiyo. Do you want to have
a body like this? If you did, you'd probably somewhat understand
what I'm talking about. This body won't decay and
it's not bound to a span of life. A puppet can be recreated
over and over again. I can create as many people
as I want with puppets. <i>If  you want, that is...</i> It's not just about increasing
the amount. A collection is all about quality. What the hell are you?! I'd venture to say I'm a human who couldn't
completely become...a puppet. I'm a puppet, but an incomplete puppet
possessing a living core. I'm not a person...
nor am I a puppet. I'll soon stop moving. Before that, I think
I'll do something pointless... It's your reward for defeating me. You wanted to know
about Orochimaru, right? At midday in ten days, go to the Tenchi Bridge located
in the Village Hidden in the Grass! What do you mean? I've got a spy working... as one of Orochimaru's
subordinates... I was supposed to rendezvous...
with him...there... It's over, Granny Chiyo. Excellent work. No. I was the one who should've...
been defeated. What? Sasori read my final attack. But for some reason,
he didn't dodge it. A slight opening was revealed. Could it be that he...? Kakashi Sensei,
aren't you ready yet? It's about ready now. That's the thing
you were talking about before? That's right.
It's my new Sharingan. Let's go, Naruto! Right! The more we fight,
the stronger they get! It looks like
we have no choice, but turn on our Reverse Mode! Reverse Mode? Allow me to explain! We, Team Guy, only under
an ultimately critical situation, can fully activate for
a single time, the Powerful Youth Burning Young Power
stored within our mind and body, using it to increase
our concentration and kiai, and for a flash of a second,
attain an explosively destructive power! All right!
Lee, now is our time to do this! Yes! Guy Sensei! Now just hold on for
a second! There is no such thing! Next time:
"Beasts: Alive Again!" How dare you… How dare you! What?! Hey, he's exactly like the… How dare you do that to Ginkaku! He's just like
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki! What is that? There's more of them?! It's been a while since I've seen
that happen to Kinkaku. So I guess Ginkaku's a goner. The red and blue balance of
your Tailed Beast chakra looks good! Go, Naruto! Here I go, Tailed Beast Rasengan… Concentrate! Didn't work, eh. You were close.
That's a shame! You lost your focus!
And you have yourself to blame! What was that feeling I just felt? Golden Bonds

 This is really not good. I apologize! It's too late for that! After all, huh?! What is that? A Jinchuriki? I-I owe you one… But what the hell is that…? Since we're now allies,
I guess it's okay to tell you. Long before Madara Uchiha
tamed the Nine Tails… the Hidden Cloud tried to capture
the natural calamity known as the Nine Tails. During the attempt, the Nine Tails
devoured Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku… and then they were expelled. Expelled? You mean from behind? Don't be ridiculous! Just go and
report to Headquarters! Request for instructions! R-Right. Where are the reinforcements?! What's the status of
Darui's First Company?! One of the enemy's strongmen,
Ginkaku, seems to have been captured. But Kinkaku is on a rampage,
cloaked in the Nine Tails' Cloak! Go, Mabui! Start preparations! Yes sir! A transformed Kinkaku will
be uncontrollable. Transformed? I get that he has the Nine Tails'
chakra, but he's not a Jinchuriki… They were inside the Nine Tails
for two weeks. Apparently, they survived by eating
the Nine Tails' entrails. No one else has ever eaten the chakra-rich flesh
of the Nine Tails. No, I take that back. There was a fellow
in the Hidden Cloud who ate the Eight Tails' legs. But he died without becoming
a Jinchuriki. Those two brothers must
be exceptional. They must be related to
the Sage of the Six Paths. Then how can we subdue him? There is just one way. Kinkaku has enormous chakra
and power. In order to seal them,
we will take advantage of the last of their Treasured Tools
and use it on him. Follow me. If I can just seal that one
 in this gourd too… In order to do that though, I need the Kokinjo to
squeeze out his spirit word. But that rope is on his left arm
covered by the Nine Tails' Cloak. I can't get it. Captain Darui! We got word from HQ! They are sending
the Kohaku no Johei. I see… That would be better than
this gourd. This is the Kohaku no Johei,
one of the five Treasured Tools, that was used to
seal the Eight Tails. It's more like a pot than a bottle. It differs from the gourd,
Benihisago, in that… if the target answers the call of
whoever is holding the pot, his voice is immediately recorded
and he becomes sealed. We managed to take
this away from Kinkaku. We will send this to Darui! But the situation is urgent. Won't it take long to deliver this? Lord Raikage… It is done! We can send this
to Darui anytime! Mabui uses
the Object Teleportation Jutsu that transports matter
at the speed of light. That is precisely why
she is my personal assistant. But if it once belonged to them, surely they know how to
counter this tool? Although it will depend on how you
make him answer and seal him. Then, I have an idea. Any strategy you come with
is sure to work. I leave it to you! Do it, Mabui! Ethereal Transmission Jutsu! Make sure you get it, Darui. We are blessed with fine aides,
aren't we, Tsunade? You are right. It's here! That's the Kohaku no Johei that
was once in our possession. I see… You intend to seal me with that. I'm glad it's here… But Kinkaku knows
how this tool works. How am I supposed to seal him? Well, HQ came up with
this strategy. Until I know what that is,
I'll guard it! Sorry, I can't afford to
let you catch me. Protect Captain Darui
with your lives! Fire Style Squad! Go! Water Style Squad! Weaklings! Earth Style Squad! Sorry about this… Double Black Panthers! Did he do it? Why you—! I'll tear you all apart! They've all been defeated… by just one man. A barrage of Fire, Water, Earth
and Lightning Styles had no effect. Forgive me, everyone… Shikaku, this jutsu
won't last long. I know, please do it. Darui… It's Shikaku from Headquarters!
Listen to me. I've been waiting to
hear from you… You have the Kohaku no Johei,
don't you? For this plan to be successful,  the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation
 is absolutely critical. Please hold on
until they get there. Ino-Shika-Cho…
That's… But Shikaku and Inoichi
are still at HQ… We've lost so many men already. To hold on is a really tall order. Where did he go? Kikuchi! Sorry I'm late! Look! Reinforcements! Over here! Now, we can keep on fighting! It's a strategy from HQ! We'll strike Kinkaku with
the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation. Until they get here,
we'll have to hold this location! They're coming?
Then we can't give up yet… Listen! Shikamaru, Choji, Ino… I am using Inoichi's Jutsu to communicate directly
with my thoughts. Listen carefully to what I say. I see… So that's the plan. I understand. So we're gonna take care
of this monster Kinkaku who killed the Second Hokage! What a drag. I feel a little scared. Hey, you guys…
Don't chicken out on me. Legends become exaggerated
over time. And when a legend is surpassed,
new legends are born. He may have the power of
the Nine Tails, but we have the power of
the Ino-Shika-Cho bond. The Ino-Shika-Cho bond ranks in
the top two of ninjutsu legends. Be confident! Do not back down!
We must hold the line! More reinforcements… Sorry we're late. He… How could he…? Hurrah! Yes! Reinforcements! – First Company reinforcements…
– Are you serious?! and now, the Fourth Company
has arrived! – Hey, hey…
– We can win! – Do you get the feeling that…
– The tide will turn now! there's a lot of hope riding on us? Were we like that? Kinda makes me nervous. Then, it'll be shameful if I don't
live up to their expectations. Hey! They're the children's version of
the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation! – Huh?!
– What?! Hey, can they pull it off? Well, I figured they'd say that. Me too. Hey, hey… A new legend will
be born here. So let's just do it! Yeah, I know. Uh-huh. Everyone, cover them! Hurl your kunai! You third-rate underlings! How is it going? You're just weaklings… As if you can bring me down! Human Boulder! Why you… Shadow Possession complete! One petty trick after another… What extraordinary power… This is nothing. I can break it
in an instant. He broke through
the Shadow Possession! Die! Nice timing, Ino… Got him!
Mind Transfer Jutsu complete! All right. Kinkaku! Yes! Why you—! Come back, Ino! We, who were touted as
the shining light of the Cloud… to be taken down by
the likes of them! Gold and silver coins may be shinier
and worth more than copper coins. But pool them together and copper coins will have equal
or greater value than a gold coin. You may be gold, but it seems
you were fool's gold. That is why we won. I'm sorry we peeled off
your gold plating… Ino! Choji! For being scared,
you did pretty good, Choji! I feel like I lost a ton of weight
from all that cold sweat. That was just a feeling.
You look fine, the same as always. It went exactly as planned. Well done, Choji. You've gotten good at controlling the speed and release of
your Mind Transfer, Ino. Units 6 through 10,
search for wounded! The rest, follow me! The rope that squeezes out
Spirit Words has been sealed along with Kinkaku… So he can't use the Ninja Tool. Now then, one more Ninja Tool…
Where is the Bashosen? Let's go, Choji…Ino! Already? C'mon, stand up. Th-That's…! Long time no see,
you Ino-Shika-Cho brats. You're Kakuzu, right? We took the "Gold." As for the "bishop," we know your tricks
and how good you are… From now on, we're on the offensive. The brat who uses shadows. Your being here means that
Hidan has been stopped, huh? Did he get his head chopped off again
while he was praying? Or does it mean he's not here
because he's still alive? As if we know what he's doing
while he's rotting away somewhere! So I don't have a rook, my gold and silver were taken and
I'm completely on the defensive. That's the fifth one. That's right… That guy has five hearts, so we have
to bring him down five times. Yeah, you're right. Time to finish the game. By the way… We have gold and silver too. Would you be interested in
who they might be? Dan Kato… Lady Tsunade's lover. And… Asuma Sarutobi. The son of the Third Hokage
and your teacher. Asuma Sensei! On the next Special Episode!

 Sakura suddenly comes falling
from the sky!

 The shock of a hard landing causes her
to lose her memory!

 Everyone in the village lends
a hand

 to help her regain
her memories, but…

 Just what in the world is happening?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Road to Sakura"

 I wonder if there's chance for me
to make an appearance in this one?

 Tune in again!

 Man, it's my day off, so how'd I end up getting sent
on an errand ? Was that lightning? No way! Is that Sakura? Sakura! Hey, you okay? Sakura! Hang on! I'll get you down
in a second! From what I see,
it's nothing serious. Her bones are fine.
Internal organs too. Considering the heights
you fell from, you're tough,
even for a student of mine. However… Hey, do you know who I am? Uh…? It's not her body, but her head. Lady Tsunade,
what's wrong with her? She has amnesia. I knew it. But it's temporary, right? It's hard to say. I've had all sorts of patients, but I haven't seen symptoms
like these before. You mean she might be
like this forever? Don't worry.
She's only 16 years old. She has so much more of
her life ahead of her. Anyway, I'll check the literature
on the condition. Beyond that, we'll just need
to keep an eye on her. What're you doing? Were these like this
from the start? They seem so unnatural.
Did they get bigger just recently? I was… blessed with these by Heaven! O-Ouch! Lady Tsunade, not her head!
You mustn't hit her head! Sometimes the shock will fix it. Sakura isn't herself right now. Try to go easy on her. Sakura, are you okay? Underdeveloped… They're average! Hey! Not the head! Shizune, easy…easy! You can only go so far with that
reckless fearlessness of yours. Because of you,
I got caught in the crossfire. You really don't remember
a thing? No. This place looks vaguely familiar. I sort of know that this is the village
where I used to live. But beyond that,
everything is foggy. I'll take you to your house. Behave yourself for a while. Wouldn't you know it?
Nobody's home! Good grief! I can't just leave Sakura here
in her condition. Hey, Ino?
Is this really my home? Yes, it is.
Ever since you were born. It's where you grew up. Since I was born? Okay, let's go ask
you-know-who for help. He's not home either! Where is he when
a friend needs him? Ino, what is this place? It's the home of
your fellow teammate. You've been together forever, so I thought this might
help you remember. What kind of person is he? Well, let's see… He's blonde, dopey-looking,
wears orange clothes, forgetful, scatterbrained
and loves ramen. Ramen? Did you remember something? Is his name… Char Siu [BBQ Pork]¸
Wakame [Kelp], Corn? Nope. Nitamago [Boiled Egg]? You're so close…
It's Naruto. Sorry, I felt like
I remembered something. That's okay.
It won't come back all at once. Another person you've known
a long time would be… Sasuke. Sasuke? He's not here in the village
right now, but… He's a totally cool guy with black hair
and good looks, and on top of that, he's… A playboy? Huh? Why'd I say that? I had this powerful image
in my mind just now. What the—? If this is her reaction to Sasuke… It's pretty serious. Sakura! I will make you better,
I promise! Really? It's the first time I've ever
seen someone with amnesia! Did she forget me too? Stupid question.
You're the first one she'd forget! This is horrible! The bittersweet days
of our youth…gone! That's so cruel! We were together? Ignore him. He's like "that," you know. So, how is she?
Will she get better? Lady Tsunade said
she'd do some research. But worst case,
Sakura might stay this way. That's not good. Right! This is when we, as friends,
have to help her! C'mon, do you remember
anything at all? We'll help you all we can! It's like I remember all
of you, but… not quite the important things. What does that mean? Well, she seems pretty confused. Poor Sakura… Okay then,
here's what we'll do. What if we all matched ourselves
to Sakura's memories? So well, we all agreed, but… I'm the Hidden Leaf's top
canine handler. I realize this is for a friend,
but getting demoted to a cat handler? I never imagined I'd face
such psychological torture. Hang in there, Shino.
We're all in the same boat. But we're doing this for Sakura. Hinata… Poor thing. But why are we separated
from everyone else and tied up tightly like this to boot?! I don't know. Apparently we,
especially you, Neji, give Sakura the chills
if we're near her. What have I ever done?
This is absolutely outrageous. Sorry about this, Neji.
But we were asked to do this. It's mortifying. Now what were these two like? Hey, Ino. Is this really going to help her
regain her memory? Everybody's looking pretty weird. But if this helps her regain
her memory, it'll be worth it. So be a good sport
and go along with it. Got it! Choji, put this on! But this is… What's going on? And Shikamaru… Sorry to do this,
but would you act sort of stupid? Huh? Why me? With a smile, if you can. Come on, Shikamaru! I don't get it. I feel like my memory is
just about to clear up, but… You tried hard.
It's all you could do… But it feels sort of strange,
you know. Like, why did I suddenly
show up there? And I can vaguely remember
everyone in the village, and yet… It's just this house that
I totally can't remember. It's as though…
I'm coming here for the first time. What is it? If it isn't Ino… Glad we caught you! Auntie, Uncle, where were you? They were having a sale
across the bridge, so we ended up buying too much. But we got the spoils! These things were heavy,
and it was a long trip, but we can't let
good spoils spoil, right? Get it? Something bad happened… What is it?
Was there a battle? Well, a bath'll  help you forget! That's enough already! Look, you're scaring Ino away! Your parents are as intense as ever. But now that they're back,
I don't have to… Why? Huh? Sakura? Why're you crying? I don't know. The moment I saw them, I… I'm sorry! Hey! Where're you going?! What's going on with those two? You don't think my jokes
were too much for her?! I see, I see… Huh? Hey, wait up! Sakura! Sakura, c'mon! Listen, I don't know
what made you cry, but why'd you run away?! Did you hear me? I don't know. But it hurts bad right here. I really don't know
what came over me. Anyway, we can't leave things
as they are. Let's go back. I could stay with you if you'd like,
until you calm down. Ino… It's gone… Huh? My pendant! Pendant? Come to think of it, you were wearing some jewelry
I'd never seen you with before. How could this happen?! I've never ever taken it off! It's something I mustn't ever lose! Sakura? Oh… There you are! Auntie! Uncle! I've had enough. You ran all the way here
at top speed… Sakura, are you looking
for something? You're at that age
where you lose things. Oh dear, it's not like you to
not needle Dad and his bad jokes. Apparently, it was
very important to her. I see. Was it this that you lost? You dropped it in front
of the house earlier. Surprised me, though. It's exactly like the one I have. Reporting. Our third line of defense has… I see… Sakura! Thank you again. Don't mention it. Your parents helped me a lot. Here… Buying the same thing—
like father, like daughter. This time, be careful not to drop it. So that's what's happening. C'mon, we chased after you.
Don't you have something to say? Uncle, Auntie, you see,
Sakura's not… What's that for?! Thank you… C'mon now, it's nothing to
get all teary about. Sakura's losing it? It's because I'm so happy. I love you both! Be sure to come home
by suppertime! I don't know what
just happened, but… I assume you remember everything? Yes, everything, finally… Then tell me… Why'd you fall from there? That day, I was dispatched with
orders from Lady Hokage. Okay, it's just ahead. I don't know what it was. Just that a powerful force
reeled me in. And when I came to,
I found myself in this world. I'm probably not
the Sakura you know. I'm not from here… This world, you say… I guess your memory's still affected. Ino! Don't worry. I'll stay with you for the long haul. I'll even study the literature
on amnesia! What the—?! Sakura? You're… Ino… Thank you…
for being my friend here, as well. Huh? What're you talking about? Hey! She just faded away? What just happened? Was it a Summoning? But I don't see any jutsu formulas. I'm probably not
the Sakura you know… Impossible… If that's true… Where did the Sakura I know go?! NINJA NETWORK NEWS



 NINJA NETWORK NEWS



Ninja Network News! Good evening,
I'm Mabui from the Cloud. I'm Shikaku Nara. On the first day since the outbreak
of the Fourth Great Ninja War, various campaigns are unfolding. The battlefields are split
into three main groups. Darui's First Company and
Kitsuchi's Second Company are deployed to the Coastal Front. Gaara's Fourth Company is facing
the late Kage in the Desert Front. Kakashi's Third Company and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist are engaged in the Frontline. Mifune's Fifth Company is en route to
provide support for the Commando Unit. Late breaking news: On the Coastal Front, the formidable enemies Kinkaku and
Ginkaku have been successfully sealed. Now, for a live report from the scene. Samui, from the First Company! Oh, it seems Darui is
on camera right now. It seems we don't have any audio. What happened to Samui? Well, let's go back to the Desert front. The enemies are
the Second Mizukage, the Second Tsuchikage, the Fourth Kazekage,
the Third Raikage… To be honest, it's hard for us to make
a connection between them. They all come from
different time periods. Let's try to go on scene. Temari from the Fourth Company? Temari? Temari? The Desert Front is definitely
engulfed in a sandstorm. I wonder how the Frontline
is doing? The Third Company has succeeded
in sealing Zabuza Momochi, one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist, as well as his subordinate. Tajiki, who's on scene? Tajiki? We can't seem to get
a hold of Tajiki. Onto the issue at hand in
this Fourth Great Ninja War. The Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails and
the Nine Tails, Lord Bee and Naruto. In order to hide from Madara, they have been isolated
inside Turtle Island. Seizing this opportunity, Naruto is currently
undergoing training for the Tailed Beast Bomb. Fool, ya fool!
Don't send it my way. I'll just send it back to you…hey! But hey! Even if you say that… I gotta teach you balance! Just count it out properly! 1 to 2, the square root of three? Fool, ya fool! For a fool, you're quite
the right triangle. I'm trying my best you know!! What kind of training is that? Well, let's talk to Naruto. Nar— Stop right there! Naruto doesn't even know
that war has broken out! Oh no! I'm sorry!
You're right! Well, we'll leave it at that for tonight. We'll see you again next time! All right! We're out! – Thanks, everybody!
– Did I do okay? Why are you with the shinobi?
You are staunchly samurai.

 To be serving the shinobi…

 How can you call yourself samurai?

 We do not serve the shinobi.

 The one master that we follow
has never changed

 since the olden days…

 It is peace!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Mifune vs. Hanzo"

 We pledge ourselves to peace,
and act upon that conviction!

MIFUNE VS. HANZO

 MIFUNE VS. HANZO

 Tune in again!

 It's no use!
We can't lose them. Tango! Get HQ! The Commando Unit,
attempting to retreat, is reporting that the enemy pursuit team
is closing in. A relief team from Fifth Company
has been dispatched. Give them the coordinates of
the closest rendezvous point. It's just from one segment,
but they're voicing opposition. They are saying most samurai
remain neutral, so why must we team up
with the shinobi? Samurai are neutral, eh? They say that because
they don't know the past. Moreover, they cannot understand
the current situation. Some also say that a shinobi war must be resolved
by the shinobi themselves. Yet these former foes still cannot
find a common ground. How do they expect to end this
without our help? Go forth! Show them
how we samurai fight! – Right!
– Right! Mifune vs. Hanzo
 
 I said let me outta here, hmm! Lord Orochimaru's chakra
is penetrating my skull and coursing throughout my body. I must succeed in my mission. Over that way… Whether it was Akatsuki
or Orochimaru… Whoever revived me will regret it! Everyone is going to think
I was playing possum again! How embarrassing is that?! I'm trying to focus.
Can you shut up, puppet granny? You shut up, old man snorkel face! Just a little more. This is close enough. Summoning Jutsu! Wha—?! Ibuse, do it! Poison Fog! What?! He resorted to the poison because
he was fed up with chasing us?! Damn it! I should be resistant to poison,
but my body's going numb. Are those reinforcements?! Hey, I'm over here! I've caught up to you. Damn it! Hanzo, I presume? I am Mifune, leader of the samurai. I wish to challenge you! We're saved. Sorry we're late. Are you all right?! Be careful. The enemy uses poison. The masks we wear are
specially made for fighting ninja and are impervious to poison. Put it on! Thanks. They need antidotes! Take the Commando Unit members
to the Medical Corps immediately! Lord Mifune! Assistance is unnecessary! If you don't want to get hurt,
stay out of my way. So you're Mifune. Why do you side with the shinobi? You are staunchly samurai. To be serving the shinobi… How can you call yourself samurai? We do not serve the shinobi. The one master that we follow has
never changed since the olden days. It is peace! Peace?! We pledge ourselves to peace,
and act upon that conviction! The battlefield is getting lively. Now then… Lady Chiyo! I haven't been playing dead. You understand, don't you, Kankuro? Uh…yes? Never mind that. Hanzo controls a poison salamander! I fought him many times
in the past. That's why I know the ingredients
to the antidote. I am also aware that the salamander
takes five minutes to produce and store up its poison. That old hag…
Rambling on about everything! Ibuse! Retreat for now! Even though I'm being manipulated, it seems I don't have to
fight them right now. Then you, Hanzo… You must know who my original foe
in battle was! I will not hold back from
the Five Great Shinobi Nations! I am going. Here he comes! It's hard?! You countered that nicely. You're not bad for
a weak man of peace and neutrality. Don't look at me that way. I once sought peace myself. I wanted to unite
the Five Great Nations into one shinobi world. But I realized right away that
such a thing was impossible. Realized? Battle after battle after battle…. And all that's left
at the end is death! "Pledge yourselves to peace?!" You know better than anyone,
what happened to that samurai! Many samurai have
become shinobi instead, and your techniques have been
passed over to the shinobi. Capture them! Sorry, but my body is acting
on its own and running away. Samurai no longer have
a role in this world! They don't believe in peace,
are influenced only by money, and their roles have been taken over
by ninja who wield powerful ninjutsu. Those shinobi fight and die,
leaving nothing behind. I am the same. You are wrong. It's not about life or death. I don't care if I lose my life
in the pursuit of peace! Having conviction is to stir
oneself into action! Your conviction has been warped! According to the Samurai Way, people are the sword and
they can live on in memories… like my Famed Blade Kurosawa. Do not compare people
to swords! What can you possibly glean
from a lump of iron? Take your ritual of seppuku. Why do you samurai try
to diminish one's own life? I repeat…conviction does not fade. Enough of this nonsense! I will get rid of you samurai,
once and for all. I will not allow you to use ninjutsu
beyond this point! The rumors were right.
You are indeed a master swordsman. This is what they meant by
ninjutsu being useless on you. You didn't even give me time
to weave a sign. And that second attack with
my sickle and chain… Even if one was familiar
with that move, no one has ever countered it. Long ago,
when I was still unknown, you and I fought, although you probably
do not remember. Is that so?
Then why aren't you dead? You snapped my sword with
that sickle and chain, and slashed my head. But somehow I survived. So you're that samurai… You didn't die? Well then, this time I will make
certain of it. Unfortunately, that will not happen. From that first blow, I understood why someone, who was
as strong as you, was killed. What?! What do you mean? I'm amazed that a shinobi of
your caliber did not notice. Don't you remember how you died? Who could bring me to this point? Have you forgotten my face? You are… Yahiko of Akatsuki! You are supposed to be dead. What's going on?! You teamed up with Danzo
and betrayed us. You now only think
of self-preservation. You're trash. I once respected you. But, you have changed. Just who are you?! How can you be so strong?! And you don't even understand
why you will lose. Vanish, Hanzo! S-Stop… What do they mean? What is it that I'm not seeing?! Be bathed in venom and die! I've had enough of your nonsense. What?! A sword that is continuously
honed will gain renown and will be passed on. And… Men who cling to their convictions
and defend them become heroes whose stories
live on throughout the ages! How?! How were you able to cut me this time?! The blade is not stained at all. Is he that fast?! You lost your conviction and
stopped honing your skills. Your swordsmanship has
lost its edge! Your blade is dull,
dirtied by blood and rusted. A dull blade is worthless! People are like swords! You did not remember me. And you probably don't recall what
you said as you left me to die. It's salamander poison. I smeared it on my sickle too. But do not fear. The poison will numb the pain
and you will die within two days. Do you know why I am feared
as Hanzo the Salamander? I shall tell you my secret. Consider it a parting gift. In my village, there was
a venomous black salamander. I was just a boy then,
but when it died, its venom sac was implanted in me. Right around here… in order to turn me into a man
capable of producing poison. I can poison people just
by breathing on them. From the time I was a child,
I was feared. So I was forced to breathe
through this mask. Then why didn't you take off
your mask during our fight? I've done that in the past. But doing that has risks. The mask serves another purpose. It protects me as well. If during battle, the venom sac
is cut and ruptured, the poison would vaporize. Even with my resistance, my body could not counter
the powerful gas, and I would be paralyzed. It wouldn't kill me, but it would give
my foe an opportunity to attack. Against someone of your caliber, I must keep the mask on
to prevent that. Although, my blade was indeed dull. People are like swords… Which means that I wasn't sharp. I will tell you one thing. Death is not the end. Loss of conviction is the end. That's why it's such a nuisance. It's hard to discern one's conviction
just by looking at them If you die here, it wasn't
because you weren't sharp. Blame your comrades, who cowered
at the first mention of my name, and gave up, leaving you to fight me. H-Hanzo the Salamander?! R-Run! You used your body as
a shield to protect them. I shall spread word of your heroism. So state your name as
compensation for your death! "As compensation for my death…" Promise me one thing. Say it. Leave my fellow samurai alone! Here's the antidote. I told you that it's hard to discern one's
conviction just by looking at them. But it's possible by fighting them. It's been a while since
I fought someone like you. I will spare you this time. Well, it's possible that you'll die,
even if you take the antidote. It is difficult to see
one's convictions through. I, too, have my own conviction. To bring peace to this world. I'm going to use you as a test. To see if you will die,
still embracing your convictions… Or you end up surviving, and abandoning those convictions
over time. You're the one who insisted
on testing me. Have you really abandoned
your conviction? Well, that's hard to tell just
by looking. There is a way to stop me,
even though I am immortal. I believed I explained it
to you before, Mifune. So step back and wait for
the opportunity to seal me. I believe you are… Lord Mifune! His poison! I'm fine. I am resistant to this poison. But that may not be
the case from here on. Everyone, retreat with me
and get ready to seal him! Just as I thought. He didn't survive the poisoning
for nothing. We'll observe from here. Lord Hanzo… Mifune…I… entrust you with my conviction! Seppuku?! By a shinobi?! He's defied the orders in my tag! Suicide?! I have no choice but to switch him
to mindless mode now. Why isn't he moving? Hanzo would never take orders from
one who hides behind the shadows, manipulating others like puppets. You put your life on the line and
regained your conviction. My friend, you were no dull blade. Seal him! Yes! They sealed him. I shall spread word of your heroism. I hereby witness
your unwavering conviction. Lord Hanzo,
you were admirable indeed! Lord Mifune? I understand Hanzo
did not have a grave. I must find someplace suitable
for him. What are you doing, Choji?!
I am your enemy right now!

 Your movements are slow, Choji!

 Pull yourself together!

 We prepared ourselves for this.

 This is too much for me.
I can't take our sensei down!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"True Kindness"

 Choji, fight! You coward!

TRUE KINDNESS

 TRUE KINDNESS

 Tune in again!

 Long time no see,
you Ino-Shika-Cho brats. You're Kakuzu, right? We took the "Gold." As for you, the "Bishop," we know your tricks and
how good you are. From now on,
we're on the offensive. The brat who uses shadows. Your being here means that
Hidan has been stopped, huh? Did he get his head
chopped off again, while he was praying? Or does it mean he's not here
because he's still alive? As if we know what he's doing
while he's rotting away somewhere! So I don't have a rook, my gold and silver are taken,
and I'm completely on the defensive. That's the fifth one. That's right.
That guy has five hearts. So we have to bring him down
five times. Yeah, you're right. Time to finish the game. By the way, we also have gold and
silver pieces too. Would you be interested
in knowing who they might be? Dan Kato… Lady Tsunade's lover. And… Asuma Sarutobi. The son of the Third Hokage,
and your master. Asuma…Sensei! I guess you're not the only ones
who took game pieces. We have a few others as well. Ironic, isn't it? Why you—! Choza! Why is the Four Flames Formation
taking so long? Hurry up and shut me inside
the barrier… before I use my Ghost
Transformation Jutsu! It's not that simple. Not when you're the target! A weird black thing has appeared! Watch out! Let's begin our counterattack. We owe you something. I hope you haven't forgotten,
you stringy mess! Sorry, I don't remember anyone
who can't make me money. They say that money talks,
even in hell. Was that true for you? Masters! Izumo, Kotetsu! Shikamaru! Choji! Ino! Help us seal him! – All right.
– Right! Izumo, Kotetsu… You two and Darui will be left
to deal with Kakuzu. Kakuzu uses Earth Style. Center your battle on
Darui's Lightning Style. Shikamaru, Choji and Ino
will take on Asuma. But…that's too harsh! Master Asuma is their teacher! You can't do that! They were Asuma subordinates,
the former Team 10. They know Asuma better
than anyone else. They have the best chance
of winning. But… No complaining! This is war! One that must be won! But… I… True Kindness

 Watch out! Hey Choji! This makes it seem like
Shikamaru is my only opponent! But it's gonna hurt, you know. I'm strong and I don't
wanna hurt you two. What makes you think
you're better? Go ahead, try and hurt us! C'mon! Cry! Scream! Stop! You're hurting me! Damn it… What a drag. Choji, are you being gentle
because they're your friends? Asuma Sensei… If that's the case, you're wrong. Sparring with a stronger partner
will only help to make them stronger too. You don't get it? Then I'll show you. We're going to spar right now. If you're able to strike me, you pass. But if you're not able to hit me
within one hour, Choji… Not just you, but Ino and Shikamaru will be
sent back to the Academy. Huh? No fair! Think of me as the enemy and charge,
for their sake too. Transform your kindness into power. Choji! Are you all right? U-Uh-huh… What's the matter with you guys? Go to Asuma now! If you truly care about your comrades, instead of running away, you need to set your mind
on improving yourself! That's what true comrades are,
you coward! I'm counting on you, Shikamaru. I'm going. Shikamaru! What'll you do, Ino? Choji! Take a good look around you,
at your comrades! Go! Come at me! Choza! I know! Choji… Do you remember
Asuma Sensei's dying words? Choji… You're a kind man who
cares for his comrades… That's why… you'll become a shinobi who's stronger
than anyone else. Be more confident in yourself. You're strong-willed,
and dependable. Both Choji and Shikamaru,
they're clumsy. So please take care of them. Let's go, you guys. Right! U-Uh-huh… We're counting on you three! All right! The kunai were to distract us. This is what they were after. Did they succeed?! Not yet! Asuma, I have to stop you! Nice move, considering
how hastily it was formed. Keep cornering me like that. Right! Once more! But this time, our aim is to restrain,
not destroy! Understood. Damn it!
What's keeping the Sealing Team?! So strong! Damn it! Fire Style! Burning Ash! What is this…?! A smoke screen?! It's you guys… It took time to find that
important sword. Now then,
where's that damn Kakuzu? I picked this up earlier… What? I'm pretty good at using it! You're not getting away! All right! I got the one
that produces thunder! This thing is great!
But I wonder who lost it? I feel like this uses an enormous
amount of chakra. But I can't worry about that now! Did you think I'd stay put? Captain Darui! I got the orders from HQ… But! Captain, we should use
the Lightning Style in one blow. I'm sorry. I went overboard earlier. Black Panther! Laser Circus! – Double Black Panther!
– Double Black Panther! I don't have enough chakra. Can you give me a moment? We're going after him, Kotetsu! Right! I'm really sorry. We're prepared for the inevitable. So Sensei, please be prepared too. Choji…Shikamaru…Ino… You've become fine shinobi. That's all thanks to you! Show me what you've got,
Ino-Shika-Cho! We'll cut him down in one sweep! A Substitution Jutsu! Run! Your movements are slow, Choji! Pull yourself together! He's coming! Shikamaru! Cast your Shadow Possession
to lead me towards Choji. That's just what I plan to do! Shadow Possession Jutsu! One more move! Even if it's a bluff, if he knows Mind Transfer Jutsu,
he'll ward it off! If he dodges the Shadow Possession
and makes a run for it, he'll be in Ino's blind spot. Exactly what I hoped for!
And there… Partial Expansion Jutsu! Checkmate, Asuma! Now, Choji! All right! What're you doing, Choji! Snap out of it! We prepared ourselves for this! Choji…! This is…
This is too much for me! I can't take our Sensei down! Choji! Move! That's…! Wind Style! Dust Storm Jutsu! Damn it! He countered it! Are you all right?! Barely. Why? Why does it have
to be like this?! It's too late to whine! We agreed to stop Asuma ourselves! What's with that look
on your face, Choji? Right now, I am your enemy,
plain and simple! I'm already dead! Don't hesitate! I know. I know that, but… Even back then, Sensei, you… What's the matter, Choji? Do you want the three of you
to go back to the Academy? I wonder if he'll do it? Fight, Choji, you coward! That's not the way.
It'll only backfire. It's not because Choji's scared. He doesn't want to hurt Asuma Sensei
the way he's hurting now. He's very kind,
down to his very core. But as it is… We have no choice. Hey Choji! Enough already,
you fatso! Shikamaru… Did you just say "fatso"? Yeah…I said "fatso." That's what Asuma Sensei said. Really…Sensei? Y-Yeah… Yes! He said that a fatso like you
wouldn't be able to punch him! You're going overboard, Ino. I don't care if you're my Sensei. Anyone who calls me "fatso"
is gonna get it! I'm sorry… I can't hit you after all, Sensei. But…but, please just send me
back to the Academy. Please don't punish Shikamaru and Ino. I understand, Choji. It's my loss. No matter how angry you are, you are able to suppress it,
and think of your opponent. You have true kindness within you. I want you to continue
nurturing that kindness. Someday, it will become your strength. But you know,
when you are sparring… I know! I don't want to beat people
like you or Shikamaru or Ino or my friend's from the village. But if I'm up against anyone
who hurts them, I'll fight them. Even if Shikamaru and Ino
keep calling me "fatso." By the way, Shikamaru and Ino,
Choji isn't fat. He's just pleasingly plump. Asuma Sensei, you said it's okay
if I'm like this. Now, Choji! I know you are kind. But right now,
taking me down is kindness! This is the time to transform
your kindness into strength! Now is the time, Choji! Please! You must stop me! Enough is enough, fatso! Just try and take me down! Did you call me "fatso"? You just said "fatso," right? I am not… I am not fat… I'm just pleasingly plump! I thought that oath was
just part of a ritual.

 I thought both my heart and body
would get stronger when I got older. But now, I…

 I have to change!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Complete Ino-Shika-Cho Formation!"

 From a caterpillar into a butterfly…

THE COMPLETE
INO-SHIKA-CHO FORMATION!

 I'll take flight!

THE COMPLETE
INO-SHIKA-CHO FORMATION!

 THE COMPLETE
INO-SHIKA-CHO FORMATION!

 Tune in again!

 The Complete Ino-Shika-Cho
Formation

 I am not… I am not fat.

The Complete Ino-Shika-Cho
Formation

 I'm just pleasingly plump! Why? It's no good. Choji has totally lost his will to fight. Why, Choji?! It didn't work! Choji! Move away! Choji! Ino Mind Transferred into Choji. That was close! Thanks for the Shadow Possession,
Shikamaru! Ino… We went on many missions
with Asuma Sensei as Team 10. I know exactly how you feel. Shikamaru and I don't want
to fight him either. But because we know Asuma Sensei
better than anyone else, we can stop him with the least amount
of risk to the Allied Force! Choji… Choji, you haven't forgotten what
these piercings represent, have you?! Everyone in Team 10 is
now a chunin. That means I'm no longer
in charge of you. Each of you will go on
to become captains and eventually lead
your own teams. These earrings are a gift to
celebrate your promotions. Don't ever forget that the four of us
were members of Team 10! And these earrings are proof that you have come of age
in your respective clans. Each of you know story behind
the Practice of the Piercings. Now go, and present
your earrings to your clans. And when you do, you will be officially recognized
as full-fledged shinobi! Now, get going! Full-fledged shinobi… I…I… Fire Style! Burning Ash! Ino, Choji! Choza! Old Man! That's right… The story about the King… I'll tell you who the King is. Lend me your ear. The children who will be taking over
the future Hidden Leaf Village… They are the King. Kurenai is pregnant with our child. I entrust…my "King" to all of you. Choji!! Snap out of it! We're not brats who need
to be protected! We're the ones doing the protecting! Would you let Asuma kill
his own child?! Your idea of kindness is wrong here! Shikamaru is right! Why do you think you
have that piercing? Quit pouting, Choji! You're the 16th head
of the Akimichi Clan! Akimichi Clan… Um…um… Of those three symbols, the one of the right belongs
to the Akimichi Clan, right? The rest are…um… The one in the middle signifies
the Nara Clan. The one on the left is
the Yamanaka Clan. Three clans that use highly unusual
Secret Ninjutsu. We've been combining
our powers for many generations and the three clans share
a special relationship. To strengthen unity and
protect our clans, the authoritative Sarutobi Clan
bestows ear piercings upon all three of our clans. Generation upon generation
has sworn the oath of loyalty on these earrings. This is it, right? The other clan heads wear one too. Piercing your ear must hurt though. The ear is pierced, so that
the message goes deep down. So that one never forgets the oath. In time, you will pierce your ear too. What?! Why? When a child becomes a genin, it is customary for the parent to
pass on his earring to the child until he attains chunin rank. It's a practice to teach
one's child about one's oaths! I don't like pain. Choji… I wonder if he's going to be okay… He's a coward. He finally became a genin,
but he doesn't like confrontation. He'll soon go out on missions and may have to face foes
in life-or-death battles. As it is… As it is, Choji will be killed because
he was too scared to make a move. I doubt if he'll ever become a chunin. Your son is not a coward.
He's just kind. In the shinobi world,
it's the same thing. Then let him be kind. "Be kind"? Yes. His kindness is a unique weapon which he, and only he, possesses. Weapon… He's just a boy. It can't be helped if it's viewed
as cowardice. But some day, his kindness will
be a thing of greatness. The time will come when
the Hidden Leaf will need his kindness. However, he will require strength
that rivals his kindness. He needs the intensity to
recognize others' pain, to feel and accept their pain… Or reject it…but still envelope them
in kindness. That boy has those qualities. Asuma… Choji will experience many things. This is the shinobi world,
the hardships will be many. But with each experience,
he will grow stronger and kinder. Choza! Please come quickly! Sorry, I'll be right there! If you are truly kind… there is no other time like now. Or are you merely a coward? Choji! It's all right! You are kind. But must this butterfly learn to live…
by borrowing strength from you? From today on,
you are an adult. You will have a new piercing
upon which you make your vow… and it will be your turn
to nurture your own child and pass on that earring. What is it? Do you think…
I can really get married? What kind of look is that, Choji?! You know what it is, right? When Asuma always tells you
that you lack something. Even I was able to get married. Have more confidence in yourself! But I might not be as lucky as you. Times are different… And it's hard to find girls
who are interested. Choji, the time has come
to make your oath! You know the words, don't you? Uh-huh… Human Boulder! I won't hand over
this last bite to anyone! With an appetite like that, there's no need to
worry about your body. After I finish eating,
can you help me train, Asuma Sensei?! Lastly, Ino, Choji, Shikamaru… There's something I want to say. Choji… You are kind and considerate
of your comrades. That is why you will be stronger
than any other shinobi. Have more confidence in yourself. Okay. And…you should diet a little. I don't know if it'll work,
but I'll try my best. I just thought that
I'd change naturally. I thought both my heart and body
would get stronger when I got older. So the war's about to begin. We have to fight dead people? What do I do? I'm getting scared. Hey Choji… It's too late to whine,
now that you're here. U-Uh-huh… I feel a little scared. Hey, you guys… Don't chicken out on me. This is too much for me! I can't take our Sensei down! Now, Choji! I know you are kind. But right now,
taking me down is kindness! This is the time to transform
your kindness into strength! This is the time, Choji! I thought that oath was
just part of a ritual. I hereby swear as the 16th head
of the Akimichi Clan, I shall pass on this oath entrusted
to me by the 15th head, unto the 17th.
To my child that is to be! Sorry, Ino. I'm okay now.
You can switch back. In order to protect the Yamanaka
and Nara Clan, and the Hidden Leaf Village… I, Choji Akimichi, swear to
transform from a caterpillar… Into a butterfly, and take flight! Choji! It's time to change! So you grew wings, Choji… without using your pills! Choji! That's my boy, Choji. Yes! That's the look! Choji's skinnier! Did he take that pill
he took long ago? This looks like the effects
of the Chili Pepper Pill. Will he be all right? He'll be fine! He didn't use the Akimichi Clan's
Secret Calorie Control Technique. He transformed on his own. In other words, he'll have
no side effects from the pill. Was the shell of the chrysalis harder
than you thought, Choji? Well, you can fly now, right? Oh yeah! I'm going up! Old man Choza! I'm sorry Choji's been
such trouble! But that's all over. He is now worthy of being
the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan. We'll deal with Asuma! Please take care of the rest, old man! Come get me! When you've weakened him,
send him over to us! You sure can bark out orders. We should go and help. Shut up! That's the Sealing Corps! Like it's that simple! Shikamaru! Your back! Right! Go, Ino! Mind Transfer Clone Jutsu! I'm up next! Shadow Stitching Jutsu! There's no way to counter this. Nice work, Choji! Choji… That's the look. As long as you have that look, you will be stronger than
any shinobi out there. Right now,
you have the expression of someone who has all
the confidence he needs! Choji! To beat me with the memento
I left you… I can't move because
I'm filled with emotion. I call it my Shadow Possession
Shuriken Jutsu. That's why you can't move. All right! Leave the rest to us,
the Sealing Corps! Can you wait a bit? What?! We already heard your last words. Hearing them a second time
won't have the same impact. Then let me add one thing
I couldn't tell you the last time. I have nothing more to say
to you three… because your Ino-Shika-Cho
formation is complete. Sensei… Asuma… Asuma Sensei… – Thank you.
– Thank you. What is that?! I'm ending this battle now! So help me out, Shikamaru! Ino! All right! Choji, I've been with you
for a long time… but I've never seen you
take charge! Naruto, I'm sorry
but I cannot let you pass.

 This many guards?
Why are you watching me?

 Enough! Just go back inside.
I'll tell you there.

 Why can't you tell me outside?
Why can't I go outside?

 Naruto!

 Why are you here?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Message from the Heart"

 Why? Tell me why?

A MESSAGE
FROM THE HEART

 A MESSAGE
FROM THE HEART

 Tune in again!

 In order to protect the Yamanaka
and Nara Clan, and the Hidden Leaf Village,
I, Choji Akimichi, swear to transform from a caterpillar
into a butterfly… and take flight! I have nothing more to
say to you three… Because your Ino-Shika-Cho
is complete. – Thank you…
– Thank you… I'm putting an end to the battle now! So help me out, Shikamaru! Ino! Choji, I've been with you
for a long time… But I've never seen you
take charge like this! A Message from the Heart

 You haven't been getting it
for a while. Half-hearted attention,
not enough preparation. Something's been bothering me
for a while now. What is it? Earlier… I thought I sensed
the Nine Tails' chakra. But there's no way
someone besides me has the Nine Tails' chakra, right? You probably just imagined it. Chakra here is cut off,
both inside and out. Nine Tails is only inside you.
It's a bad joke, no doubt. Naruto's beginning to
sense things. The only ones with
Nine Tails' chakra besides Naruto, are the Gold and Silver Brothers. Which means, they've been resurrected
with Orochimaru's jutsu. However, he has the power to perceive the chakra
more intensely in this room. We won't be able to fool him
much longer. What'll we do, Bee? Do what? What do you mean, "do what"? Weren't you paying
attention to the plan? We're not supposed to
let Naruto out of this space! That's what you're here for, Eight! What a…! Damn it. Where's the bathroom? Go outside.
It's the door to your left. You idiot!
Naruto's gonna escape! Follow him! Oh! Don't panic. Contact HQ. What? Nine Tails is attempting to go out? What is Bee doing?! Actually, Master Bee wasn't
paying much attention to the instructions… However, we've taken measures. Lady Tsunade, please issue the order. Mmhmm. Stop…Naruto. Why are there are so many guards?! Something's not right. Naruto, I'm sorry,
but I cannot let you pass. Please go back to that room. Okay, but why is Shino's pop here? Why are you watching me?! Enough! Just go back inside,
I'll tell you there. Why can't you tell me outside? Shibi, I'll talk to him. I-Iruka Sensei! What're you doing on this island?! We now have a secondary mission
on this island. And we're here to back you up. We heard this place is dangerous. So why can't I go outside? There's an unidentified creature that we're trying to confirm. That's because… I sensed the Nine Tails' chakra. Is that related somehow? He was able to perceive Kinkaku and
Ginkaku's chakra even in here? A place where all chakra
is blocked out? Letting him out would
be dangerous. We must stop him. Do your best to convince him, Iruka. O-Oh, yeah. The creature seems to possess
the Nine Tails' chakra. I guess there were others
like the Nine Tails here. We can't afford to let you out and rile up the Nine Tails
inside you. That's why we want you
to stay inside and lay low. Is that why Captain Yamato
hasn't come back? Yes. The Wood Style works best
to suppress the Nine Tails' chakra. You know that. Come on, let's go back inside. Master Bee stands at the top
of this island's hierarchy of beasts. That feeling I had when
I exchanged punches with old man Bee… That was for real. If those animals are running amuck,
I'll suppress them. Let me check them out! Do not let Naruto escape! Right! All right! I have him restrained
with Shadow Possession! W-What's going on? He sensed it all with Sage Mode. Why is this happening?! It's war… Madara is waging war on us. Hey, Iruka! You… Shibi, let's stop lying. Naruto isn't stupid. We should tell him the truth and try to make him see
where we're coming from. My comrades are fighting,
and going through hell… Why are you keeping
all this from me? This is a war to protect you. Madara launched
a full-scale assault. In order to capture Nine Tails
and Eight Tails inside you and Lord Killer Bee. If he succeeds in getting
both Tailed Beasts, his jutsu will be complete,
and this world will end! Protecting you means
protecting the future, and protecting everyone. Everyone is putting
their lives on the line. They are fighting to protect you. Naruto, your battle is with yourself. This is where you must endure it. There's no such thing
as true peace! As long as we live
in this cursed world, peace is impossible! Then…I'll break that curse. If there is such a thing
as peace, I'll seize it! I'll never give up! No matter how great the pain,
I'll continue walking. Because that's who Naruto is! War inflicts death, injury,
and pain to both sides. You may try to find
meaning in death, but there is only pain. An unbearable hatred… Senseless deaths… Eternal hatred…
and pain that does not heal. That's what war is. Naruto… This is what you will
be facing in time. My work ends here, Naruto. I believe you can bring true peace. Nagato… What you said to me… Is this what you meant? Now, let's go back in. I'll stop this war by myself. I'll take on all
the hatred and the pain. This is my duty! Haven't you been listening?! You have the Nine Tails inside you! This isn't only about you, Naruto! You were the very first teacher
who recognized me, yet you're only concerned
about the Nine Tails! Why can't you have faith in me?! Don't act like a spoiled brat?! To me, you are… Taking on a parental tone
like that won't work. There's no way that monster fox
won't take advantage of his power. You just don't know how he… That's true…
if he's the monster fox. But Naruto is different. He's… He's someone I've recognized. He's an excellent pupil. He always gives
a hundred percent and yet, because he's clumsy,
people don't acknowledge him. He already understands
what human suffering is. He's not a monster fox anymore. He's the Village of
the Hidden Leaf's… Naruto Uzumaki! To me, you are… An important student. And… I think of you as my little brother. The enemy leader is targeting you
with everything he's got. How can we allow you to
face such danger? And besides, there is no reason
for you to shoulder that burden alone. I'm different from before. I've become stronger! And Sensei, you're the one
who gave me that headband. Hey…Iruka… No! I still can't let you go! Sensei, didn't I tell you
I'm stronger now? A barrier like this is… He broke through! I won't let him! The Nine Tails' chakra is too strong. The Parasitic Insects are useless! Temui! Notify the Barrier Corps up ahead,
that Naruto is heading their way. Right! The rest of us will pursue Naruto! Let's go! Why, Iruka Sensei? What's this? Knowing you, you will rush
to the battlefield. That's how determined you are. If you are reading this letter… it means I wasn't able to
stop you. Ever since Lady Tsunade
ordered me to detain you on
the Cloud's secret hidden island, I've had this letter ready,
just for this purpose. I'm disappointed in myself
for failing my mission. I don't know if I'll even
be able to get you this note, but there's something
you need to hear from me. You've gone off,
so this is the only thing left to say. Come back alive,
no matter what. I'm sorry, Naruto. I'm weak. I act like your older brother, but I've never been able
to protect you… So he's gone…fool, that fool. Killer…Bee, right? I need to ask you a favor. I'm not sure,
but I've seen you someplace Every time,
I can't remember the face. Please protect Naruto! That's not the way to appeal, you see. You have to raise your fist at me. L-Like this? Gotcha! Fool, ya fool! It's you… Should you be making
a promise like that?! You're Naruto's guard! If he couldn't stop Naruto,
no one can. That's because… You're always in Naruto's heart. You are his state of mind. Me? In Naruto…? I don't know what you did to Naruto… But to him,
you are something special Even tho' my rap is scornful. Naruto listens to all you say. Naruto's kept it securely inside him,
to this day. What has protected Naruto
all this time…were your words to him. You really intend to leave
this place to go after Naruto? We're still in training, you fool, ya fool! You're gonna get
Raikage's Iron Claw afterwards, that's for sure! You learn faster in
actual battle, you fool! We're taking the shortcut, ya fool! What is the meaning of this, Tsunade?! The Nine Tails couldn't be stopped! That Iruka… We'll just have to use force. What's the status of
the Barrier Corps? They've put up a 36-layer
Self-Regenerating Barrier around the perimeter. Even a Jinchuriki will not be able
to pierce through it. Please rest assured. It's Naruto! He's approaching! It's time for us to show what we,
the Barrier Corps, can do! This is the reason why
we went through all that hardship, to put up this multi-layered barrier! Do not let him pass! The only message HQ
will receive from us is… "Mission accomplished!" Do you understand?! Wha—?! What's this?! There's a barrier beyond that. You and me are gonna break it, stat! Octopops! I'll break the barrier, fool! Naruto, you get the Tailed
Beast Bomb in, ya fool! Right! Not Bee the Eight Tails too?! What?! Here we go, ya fool! It's no use! The barrier isn't regenerating
fast enough! At this rate… Chief… What do I tell HQ…?! We couldn't stop him! Yeah, I figured. – D-Damn it!
– It's no use… But there were two
of them breaking it. No one mentioned
there were two of them! Incredible chakra!

 An immense chakra field has
appeared on the battlefield

 near Darui's First Company!

 What is it?

 It appears to be some sort
of humanoid monster!

 It's ravaging our troops!

 And it seems to be controlled by…

 Who is it?!

 We believe it's Madara Uchiha!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Attack of the Gedo Statue"

 Go! Gedo statue!

ATTACK OF THE GEDO STATUE

 ATTACK OF THE GEDO STATUE

 Tune in again!

 There it is! Huh? Wasn't this an island? How come it's connected to land? Minor stuff you don't need to know… Now, are ya ready?
'Cuz here we go. Attack of the Gedo Statue

 I'm bored with playing cards. How else can
we amuse ourselves? We have no choice. Found them! This is it! So before I can get
the Feudal Lords, I have to get
through you first, huh. Get through us. It's noisy outside. How am I supposed
to concentrate? Lava Style! Chojuro… I won't let you…! The Eight and
Nine Tails' chakra! They've appeared at last! I must send word. Looks like the Eight Tails and
Nine Tails have appeared. So the Eight Tails and
Nine Tails are out. But what about the Feudal Lords? We should capture them to use
as bargaining chips, right? No, we don't need
the Feudal Lords anymore. If we capture them, the nations would pressure
the Allied Shinobi Forces. But from the very beginning,
those lords were mere tools to lure the Eight and
Nine Tails out. Now that the Eight and
Nine Tails have emerged, there's no need for
indirect measures. We're dealing with the Raikage. He's aware that in this war,
the Feudal Lords have no value. If Project Tsuki no Me succeeds,
it's all over. What, really? So Black Zetsu is fighting
Mizukage for nothing? No. Shinobi still cannot disregard
the Feudal Lords who hired them. Tell Black Zetsu to continue
his guerilla assault. By stalling the Mizukage
and her men there, we'll be able split up
the enemy's battle strength. You're right. And what about you, Tobi? It's finally time for me
to join the battle. First, I'm going to steal
the substitute. – Ninja Art!
– Ninja Art! – Four Flames Formation!
– Four Flames Formation! Well done! Once inside this barrier, even those controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu are helpless. Yes… Right. This is… the last one! I'm dying. Help me… You used too much chakra. Don't use this Ninja Tool anymore! But, I'm so good with it. Thanks, big guy from the Leaf! It's far from over. This is just…the beginning. That's some assessment. We're the victors here. We've defended
the coastline to the end. Your amphibious operation
is a failure. Summoning Jutsu! Y-You're… No way! What is that?! It's bigger than Choji. I have a bad feeling about this. I-It's not just big… That's some assessment
on your part too. Come! Choji! Please deal with
Kakuzu and Hizashi! I'll handle that one! Sealing Corps! Go, Gedo Statue! It's there, eh… Choza… Dad! Yeah! Now, Choji! He stopped me?! What happened? What's happening up there?! Now then… Incredible chakra! An immense chakra field has
appeared on the battlefield near Darui's First company! What is it?! We reached the First Company. It appears to be some sort
of humanoid monster! And it seems to be controlled by… Who is it?! We believe it's Madara Uchiha. If that's true, we must revise
our battle strategy. The leader joined the battle? For what reason? We don't have enough data
for an assessment. Naruto, preserve that mode
for the fight ahead. Use up your strength,
and you'll end up seeing red. I can't waste anymore time! Incoming message! Killer Bee and Naruto have
both broken through the barrier, and escaped. What?! That barrier is supposed to
be impenetrable, even to Jinchuriki! No one foresaw two Jinchuriki
coordinating an escape! Two of them?! It seems Master Bee
is helping out. Damn! Now what are they up to? I will personally stop the Jinchuriki. Tsunade, you come too! Who will manage Headquarters? Shikaku of the Leaf! Understood. You can leave this to me. All right!
Follow me, Tsunade! Lord Raikage! Please don't break down
any walls. Let's go. Oh…right. I can't believe this. Get back! Everyone, retreat to
the coastline! Earth Style! Mountain Jutsu! What is that thing? What power…
It's extraordinary! Taking into consideration
all the data gathered so far, and the data Temari of the Sand
gave to the Allied Forces Council, I wonder if that's… According to the Kazekage's intel,
a Jinchuriki's powers are sealed inside a giant humanoid statue
used for the ritual. Bee's octopus leg clone
most likely has been absorbed into it. A humanoid monster… Don't tell that's it?! My reserved special move
had no effect at all. Sealing the Jinchuriki powers
into that thing… means… Why you—! Damn it! You can't have that Ninja Tool! I don't want the Ninja Tool! I want what's inside. I'll return the Ninja Tool later. If you want it that badly. You took advantage of
the Gold and Silver Brothers, who possess the Nine Tails' chakra,
by utilizing them on the frontlines. Now that you're through with them, you want to seal their chakra
inside that monstrosity… Seems the Allied Forces have
a shrewd one in their midst. Am I wrong? What a shame
that you're my enemy. Don't tell me that giant is… No way… Damn it! Shikamaru?! Are you all right, Shikamaru? You're a lifesaver, Choji! Sorry to bother you twice. Don't stress over it. I apologize. So what happened to him? He disappeared with
the Ninja Tool. They retreated? Choza, seal me! Hurry…
Hurry and seal me! Don't be afraid!
Surround him! The tide of the war has suddenly
changed in their favor. Darui, we must contact
HQ secretly and regroup. I know. It's almost dark. We have to be prepared for
a night invasion and keep our eyes open. Losing this war is not an option. Make no doubt about it. My long-standing desire…
Project Tsuki no Me… shall be realized tomorrow,
at long last… He's already sealed
Kinkaku and Ginkaku? He only has part of
the Eight Tail's chakra… one part of his tentacles. I think you're rushing into this, but I'll go along with
your plans tonight… while I keep some of
my pieces in reserve. Good work, Sai. Get as much rest as you can. Kakashi… All right! Those who are fit for guard duty,
gather around! I can't see the enemy. What'll we do? Retreat? Or advance? Right now, this company is
without captains. We'll just have to stand
our ground and wait for orders. Luckily, we have a bunch
of Sensory-Type ninja… who are ideal for this. They're not coming… I don't sense anything
in the sand either. We can safely assume
they've retreated. I should think the wiser move
with the Reanimation is to keep raising the dead
and fight hard. So are you saying they have
a better plan than that? Lord Gaara, please use this! You must conserve your strength. Give that to him first. Huh? To this puny old man? I am the Tsuchikage. – Huh?!
– Huh?! We have no idea what they may
be planning in the dark of night. Stay on guard at all times. – Yes, sire!
– Yes, sire! Where is my Ninja Tool?! I want it back! You were told not
to use it anymore! I don't want to! I'm really good with it! It's such a waste! I notified HQ that Madara
has taken a Treasured Tool. And that he got
the Tailed Beast's chakra. I'm very sorry.
This was my fault. If only we had
realized it sooner… No, you responded well. It can't be helped that
he was unstoppable. In any case, we were able
to repel the enemy for one more day. Nearly 40,000 out of 80,000. That's how many
the Allied Shinobi Forces lost today. 50,000 out of 100,000. That's how many Akatsuki
we got today. Each side lost nearly
half its force. But our side consists
of living flesh. While the enemy… I'm coming now, everyone! Sasuke, who used to
be with you,

 has been gripped by hatred
for a long time.

 Have you ever been able
to do anything for him?

 Ever since that day…

 That's right, you've known it
ever since that day.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Unison Sign"

 Ya know, Nine Tails, I…

UNISON SIGN

 UNISON SIGN

 Tune in again!

 The Nine Tails' Chakra Mode. Great for lighting the night road, could cost me my life
like a double-edged knife. Naruto may have learned to
use Nine Tails' Chakra Mode, but he hasn't made
the Nine Tails his friend. Nine Tails continues to
sap Naruto's chakra. When Naruto's chakra
reaches zero, he'll die. Oh yeah. But Naruto's tension's high.
Be a shame to stop that passion… It's okay to use Nine Tails' chakra
like a flashlight. But stick close to him, Bee! You got it. Naruto… You're always so careless
with my chakra. I've been inside you,
watching you for a long time. Naruto… You are still so naïve. I will settle this war by myself! I will bear all of the hatred
and the pain! That is my duty! Thanks to my chakra, looks like
you've put on some weight. But it's not like you, Nine Tails…
to start up a conversation. I know you're starting to
get lonely and want to talk, but I'm busy now! Let's do this later! Do you seriously think you can
end this war by yourself? It's impossible. I'm sure you've sensed
how huge the enemy is. This is Madara we're talking about.
There's no telling what he'll do. You're welcome to use my power… I'm not falling for that anymore! You've gotten a bit smarter, I see. That was so obvious! We'll talk after the war. See ya! If your comrades are killed,
hatred will rise. Are you planning to defeat
the enemy before that happens? If you defeat the enemy,
they'll bear hatred towards you. Do you honestly think you can take
all of that on yourself? Stop treating me… like I'm stupid! Unison Sign


 Unison Sign

Stop treating me    
like I'm stupid! You don't understand a thing!
You're naïve! Can you honestly take on and
erase everyone's hatred?! The war has already started. There must be a considerable
amount of casualties already. And, the resulting hatred. First of all, Sasuke,
who used to be with you, has been gripped by hatred
for a long time. Have you ever been able
to do anything for him? Ever since that day… That's right, you've known it
ever since that day. NINJA ACADEMY Who am I going against? Who's my guy? The kid with the doggy cap? The hooded kid with the shades? Or… Um…Sensei… What is it? I don't want to fight my friend. No, this isn't about hitting. This is just some traditional
Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat. Even the Hokage
who came before, trained and got stronger by sparring… Umm… Sensei, you can put me down
for going out of bounds. Please move on to
the next ones up. H-Hey! You might call this training
or whatever, but if there's going to be a winner,
it's got to be a match. Since that's the case,
wouldn't it save you trouble by just deciding
who wins at the start? He really has no motivation.
He'll never make chunin. No, not necessarily. Huh? Life is long.
A lot could happen. Man, you're sure fixated
on the minor details! That Shikamaru,
he's the most trouble of all! And you, Choji,
you've got no guts! Ino, do you know those boys? Yeah well, our parents… Forget it… Shikamaru, Choji…
give the Unison Sign. Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, Shikamaru. Forget it… You were never good
at stuff like this. It's a drag for me, too. Good, you've done
the Unison Sign. Next, Naruto Uzumaki! Yes! Is he the one…? My parents said not to
speak to him. He's one guy I don't want
to be paired with. And Sasuke Uchiha.
Step forward. Sasuke! Sasuke! I wish I could do
the Unison Sign with Sasuke! Do your best, Sasuke! Pound your opponent! What's with him acting so cool?! Damn it! I'll take down
Mr. Popular and show her who
she should be looking at! I'm not gonna lose. No way! H-Hang in there…Naru… Sasuke! It'll be Naruto Uzumaki
versus Sasuke Uchiha. Come on, you idiot! Naruto! Make the proper Spar Sign! It's part of the etiquette! The heck with all that! Hurry up and
let me defeat this guy! I'm going to become popular! What a waste of time… I'll make it quick,
just like you want. Hold on, you two! For crying out loud! Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat
is a traditional training method passed down through
the generations. It might be stuffy etiquette, but here at the Academy,
we start with the basics. It matters! You always start by showing
your opponent a one-handed sign, which represents half of the two hands
used when unleashing a jutsu, and displays
your intention to fight! This is called the Spar Sign. After the sparring is done
and the victor is decided, both partners present
the Spar Sign, then bring their hands together
to form the Unison Sign as a show of friendship. This is the etiquette of
hand-to-hand combat. Are you listening, Naruto?! This is the second time
I've explained it! Yeah, yeah. One "yes" is sufficient, you fool! I get it. Naru… Pound him, Sasuke! Start! – Amazing!
– He's so cool! Sasuke, you're terrific! Wow… This guy… That look in his eyes… It's the same look that
everyone gives me. No, it's stronger than that. But… But it's not for me. Sasuke wins! Now, both of you make
the Unison Sign. All right, next! Wait! So you couldn't care less about me,
is that it, you turd?! No, you piece of crap!
Hard and runny! Stupid! Stupid! The guy's so dumb,
he can't even swear properly. I wish he'd make up his mind if he's constipated or got the runs.
The reason is… That's what I mean by you
being fixated on the minor details! You got something to say to me,
you hard and runny crap-turd?! Ouch! Didn't I tell you that
Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat is a sacred tradition?! Now hurry up and
make the Unison Sign! You too, Sasuke! Damn it… You want a piece of me, you loser?! Hey! That's enough! Both of you! Naruto's the worst! What is up with him? Looks like you remembered. And then, what happened to Sasuke? Were you able to erase his hatred? No, in fact, just the opposite… Have you snapped out of it yet? You have no siblings
or parents. How could you understand
anything about me?! You've been on your own
since the beginning! What makes you think
you know anything about me? Naruto… You can't change me,
no matter what you say to me now. I'm going to kill each and
every person in the Leaf, including you! Sasuke, is that really
the only way? Yes. So your only choices are to kill me and become
the hero who saved the village, or to be killed by me,
and be known as just a loser! His hatred has grown
even stronger! It happened to
your closest friend! In other words… regardless of who
you're dealing with, you can neither erase their hatred
nor take it on yourself! So? Are you finished? What?! Are you trying to scare me
into doing nothing? That's exactly what you want,
isn't it, Nine Tails? Hey… You're the one who's naïve! Who are you to be so confident… when you couldn't
even save Sasuke? Once you question
your own beliefs, it's over. I will help Sasuke somehow, and I will do something about this war! Does he intend to seal me again? On top of which,
inside a kid like that?! Hey, you stupid fox! I've been letting you
stay inside my body, so why don't you pay me
some rent, and lend me some of
your chakra? Sage Mode… Rasengan…Super Barrage! Just one more round! What is this power?! This is…the Nine Tails'… Naruto… You've… You've made me angry, Naruto! You still had this much power? You really are awesome! Is this the Six Paths'…?! You'll regret this, Naruto. The little child thinks
he's grown up, does he? Ya know, Nine Tails, I… I'm going to come after all that hate inside you
as well, some day! You've put me through
a lot of pain, but I know that
it doesn't feel good to be at the mercy of your hatred… Are you stupid?! I'm the Nine Tails, you know! Some little child can't change me! I am hatred! Then it's okay! I'm no longer a little child, and it's more challenging that way! Later! Nine Tails… You might be right about me
being extremely naïve. But in my heart,
you've always been with me, like a mother and father
stays with their child. You know everything
about how I feel and how I've grown up. You might not have
liked doing it, but you continued to
watch over me. That's why… I want you to be there to
watch over me just a little longer. Sasuke, you too… You might never have given
a rat's ass about me from the very beginning, but I've always been
watching you. That's right, I'll do something about
both Sasuke and the war! Yo! Naruto shining bright Looking grave on a full-moon night Try to lighten up…Yo! Did you fight with the Nine Tails again? Tailed Beast mode is a tug-of-war
between the Nine Tails and chakra. When the chakra runs out,
it's curtains without a doubt. So don't be reckless, yo! I know I'm being reckless. But… I don't go back on my words. That's my ninja way. Here we go! Wait for me, yo! I've taken care of all
your external wounds.
 
 Please rest.

 Are you all right? Seems our medic ninja
are being killed.

 Neji…

 It's easy to get discouraged.

 We don't even know
who we're fighting.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Medic Ninja in Danger"

 Yeah, we have to be careful.

MEDIC NINJA IN DANGER

 MEDIC NINJA IN DANGER

 Tune in again!

 Hey! Neji, are you all right?! Yeah… I'm okay. Don't overdo it. Your eyes aren't the only things
that can track the enemy. I have my nose. Leave this to me and get yourself checked out
by the Medical Corps. There's a medic tent in the rear center
of every company. The coordinates are… How much did you know
about the Akatsuki? I thought I knew more
than you did, but… Ultimately, we're both shinobi
who were used. Thanks to our powerful
Visual Prowess. This time too…
The user of this jutsu is using us. Pain… With your Six Path's Rinnegan
and my Mangekyo Sharingan… we could do anything. The jutsu user intends to
take advantage of my genjutsu power
when the time is right. Itachi, you have always been wrapped
in darkness, even when you were
part of the Akatsuki. Medic Ninja in Danger

 I need two Jonin Medics
over here, please! We have to resuscitate now! Quickly! – Right!
– Right! Are you sure you can
carry this much? Halt, please! Under orders from HQ, we Sensory-type shinobi will
have to verify your chakra! We will not allow you to pass
until this is done! Sure, I understand. Hurry and get it over with. I'll bandage it… Okay… That should do it. Thank you… Take care. Okay, next please. Neji! I've taken care of all
your external wounds. Thanks. Please get some rest,
while you can. Especially your eyes! You shouldn't overuse them. That's easier said than done. My job is to discern things
faster than anyone, and notify HQ, in order to improve
our chances in battle. To do that, I have to put
my eyes to work. I know that. But while you're here… Thanks. All right, the next tents on
our rounds are F5 through G3. Is something the matter? If you're still in pain… B-Bad news! Toyosa, Takemaru,
and Hino are dead. Someone has assassinated them! What?! What's going on? A spy has infiltrated us. They're targeting Jonin Medics. But how? In order to get here, everyone's chakra undergoes
strict verification. It's impossible with a simple
Transformation Jutsu. And you cannot get through here unless you're a shinobi of
the Allied Forces. Which means… that an Allied shinobi is being
manipulated by a jutsu. It's highly probable. It's a formidable jutsu. What happened here? Neji… I see… If there are only
Allied Force shinobi here, they'll be hard to distinguish. We can't tell who the suspect is. We're all standing
around right now, and it could be any one of us. And this is sure to breed
suspicion among us. That's what the enemy
is hoping for. We Medical Ninja are critical for
our battle strategy to succeed. There's no way you can confront the undead from the Reanimation Jutsu
without our back up. If we're paralyzed now… It will ruin our chances in the battle,
that starts at dawn. I'll find the killer with
my own eyes! In any case,
no matter what happens, we cannot ignore the wounded. We'll continue our treatment. But we must be extra careful. Especially the Jonin Medics. Now then… I-It's time to go on rounds. Y-Yeah… W-Where did I…first meet you? Huh?! No… Listen, it's not like
I'm suspicious of you. Of course not. It's just…just… You are suspicious of me! Oh, it's you. Don't scare us like that. Say, have you seen
Sakura Haruno? Is something wrong? I got suspicious about someone. I was tailing him, but lost him… Thinking back, I get the feeling that
he was hanging around Sakura. Sakura is in Tent 3. What does this suspicious guy
look like? Well… I could've sworn… Well, it's me. Oh! It's you. Is your wound still bothering you? Oh, no… It's fine. A-Actually, ever since you treated me… I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you. What is this? I-It's…what they call a "love letter." When I go into battle again, there's no guarantee that
I'll come back alive. So… Thank you. But…I'm already in love
with someone. Oh, I see… I guess he's probably…a Leaf. Well, a rejected man has no right
to pry into who you love. I understand. I'll go now. I'm sorry… I hope it all works out. If you love him… he must be a great man. What's going on? Why is the jutsu user
going through such pains to prevent us from
encountering the enemy? He's not going to use
your genjutsu, after all? It's night. Stalemate. Before he uses us to
break the silence, Madara has something up
his sleeve. This Reanimation is the jutsu
of Madara's new ally. It did not figure into
Madara's original plans. Is that it? Probably. You all right? Neji… It's easy to get discouraged. We don't even know
who we're fighting. I know, we must be careful. Yeah… Are you sure you don't need
to go to the Medical Corps? Cut it out, Kiba! I said I'm fine! You overused your Byakugan
and can barely stand! So don't bother showing off
in front of your subordinates! Shut up, Kiba! What the hell? You're so weak, you can't tell the difference
between a dog and a man! And your Visual Prowess is
supposed to be your specialty! Hinata, don't overdo it either. That's because I have spread
my Parasitic Insects throughout the area,
to look out for the enemy. Shino, I appreciate your concern. But I want to give it my all! This is a war to protect Naruto! We cannot lose! By the way, Sakura… Where is Captain Shizune now? Huh? Did you figure something out? Yeah…a little. We need to be in contact
to report anything, no matter how trivial it is… Until we find the suspect. Well, I think she's in Tent B-2. Shizune is treating Tonton. Seems like a bad leg sprain. Well, that's better
than injuring a hand. Will they be able to
rejoin the battle? I think so… Tonton can still weave signs,
since the hand is uninjured. I see… That's good. By the way… Sakura, would you mind taking
a look at my arm one more time? It hurts a little. Sure… You can sit over there. How did you know?! Pigs don't have hands! Cha! Tonton can still weave signs,
since the hand is uninjured. Tonton…is a pig?! She tricked us! Smart alec! So, you're the murderer! Tell me… How were you able
to recreate Neji's chakra?! What kind of jutsu is it?! Explain or you'll get another one! My Transformation Jutsu
is the best. I may not be the only who
has infiltrated this place. If this is just like
Captain Yamato's report… Note… Regarding Parasitic Clones. Kisame Hoshigaki was originally
thought to have been taken down by the Raikage and Killer Bee… But it appears he survived, having switched places
with a parasitic clone or something that is a type
of Transformation Jutsu. Because this transformation also
replicates the target's chakra, it is difficult to detect. At the Five Kage Summit, Zetsu of the Akatsuki suddenly
emerged from other people's bodies. He had absorbed chakra… And this guy's transformation…
I get it! You are able to manipulate
the chakra that you absorb. You can transform your chakra
into your victim! Isn't that right?! There's too many of them! You're absorbing chakra! She's a smart woman! W-Well…I wonder about that… You may be able to
camouflage yourself, but you're not very good
at lying, are you? What happened?! Did you hear that loud
sound just now?! Who's that?! I have to contact HQ immediately! Please take care of this guy! You've hauled too many
heavy loads, Tonton. What happened? Sakura has an emergency! Lady Shizune, reporting! Empty it all out! We're on guard duty next. I must have a bigger bladder
than you. Look at the big ripples I made! The ripples are… Don't forget to piss either, Tetsu! It's going to be a long night. Hey Tetsu! Don't stand behind me. You're distracting me,
and nothing's coming out. How about if I make you
bleed instead? H-Hey?! It happened again! There are reports from
every sector that our comrades are being ambushed
one after another! There's confusion everywhere! We don't know who the enemy is! What's going on?! A night raid is supposed
to have been ruled out! On top of that, we added security
and positioned Sensory-type ninja… Why can't we detect the enemy?! Is it some kind of poison? What's the condition of the corpse?! All of them have external wounds! They're physical attacks! No doubt they're controlling
Allied shinobi with genjutsu. Could it be Itachi? Uchiha Itachi is
the only one I know who would be undetectable
by my Sensory Unit, yet still be able to manipulate
with genjutsu from afar. But this is impossible for even Itachi… controlling minds simultaneously, over such a wide area,
with such precision. Hold on! We just got word from
the Medical Corps! The enemy looks to be… White Zetsu transformed
into an Allied Force shinobi. He's able to mirror chakra imprints! That explains it… So during the day battle, if one of our shinobi got
his chakra absorbed… White Zetsu can transform
into him completely! What should we do,
Shikaku of the Leaf? There is no way we can weed out
who is friend and who is foe! How will we prepare
for the battle at dawn? If we don't find
the enemy immediately, we'll not only lose precious time, but our own men will
become casualties! In the end, they could
end up killing each other! So this is the power of White Zetsu… The battle during the day
was simply to set up the night… This was the enemy's true motive. Calm down… I am rational. If I calmly analyze the situation,
I will find a way! Sort and evaluate… Review every piece of intel
relating to this war and develop a counter strategy! But stay cool, and do it quick. Cool, but quick! Don't let them touch you.

 That's because they'll absorb
our chakra!

 Easier said than done…

 How are we going to take them down
without touching them?

 I sent out a messenger owl.

 The sealing corps should arrive
shortly to seal up this mine.

 So we just have to wait until then?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"White Zetsu's Trap"

 WHITE ZETSU'S TRAP

Just how many                          
of them are there? WHITE ZETSU'S TRAP


 Tune in again!

 Tell me. How were you able to
recreate Neji's chakra?! You are able to manipulate
the chakra that you absorb… You can transform your chakra
into your victim! Isn't that right?! As war rages on… The White Zetsu infiltrate
the Allied Forces. A barrier protects the camp surroundings,
making infiltration difficult. But it seems there might be
an opening in the barrier. Team 8 has come to
investigate this. I think we might have just walked
into something dangerous. Well, at least it's clear now. This is the spot
where the barrier is open. This is where they're entering from. There are quite a few of them. Please be careful! Byakugan! Kiba! Fang Over Fang! Hidden Jutsu: Beetle Sphere! Shino! How many of 'em are there?! Don’t let them touch you. If we do,
they’ll absorb our chakra! Easier said than done! How are we going to take them down
without touching them? I just sent out a messenger owl. The Sealing Corps should arrive
shortly to seal up this mine. So we just have to wait until then? Damn it! Things are only getting worse! Hinata! Kiba! Shino! They're here! Are you the Sealing Corps? We'll seal this immediately! Please exit this way! We're not going to let you go! They're persistent! Fang Over Fang! What?! There's oil on the ground? Paper Bombs used for mining?! This isn't good!
It's going to explode! Akamaru, time for Dynamic Marking! White Zetsu's Trap

 Are you all right, Akamaru?! This is awful… Is anyone there?! Shino! Hinata! I'm over here. Shino… You're okay! Yeah. Where's Hinata? I don't know. Those Paper Bombs were a surprise. We'd better find Hinata. Can you locate her
with your scent? I can't…
The smell of smoke is too strong. Hinata! Hinata! I don't sense the enemy anymore. I guess those white guys
were blown away. Call it fortune in misfortune. But with a blast that strong,
the exit might've been sealed off. Kiba! Hey! Nope… He's dead. Who's there?! Kiba! Shino! Hinata, you're all right! The ground gave way and
I fell to the lower level. That's… It's unfortunate… Wasn't there one more
from the Sealing Corps? Let's look for him. Yes. Let's find him and
get out of here. Yeah… We can't escape. Huh? Why?! The explosion didn't kill this shinobi. He was fatally wounded
by a kunai. Then he was killed
after the explosion?! Yes… The enemy survived. They can absorb a victim's chakra,
but also take that victim's form. If I were him, I could take advantage
of the confusion, and slip right back into our forces. So you're saying
there's a fake among us? It's not impossible. Hey, hey!
We're on the same team! We'd be able to
see through a fake, right? I wonder about that… Hinata, why aren't you using
your Byakugan? Well, because… the Sealing Team's barrier jutsu
was incomplete when it was activated… and disrupted my Byakugan. Is that the truth? Hey, you suspect Hinata?! Kiba, are you telling the truth
that your nose isn't working? Not me too?! What about you?
Are you the real Shino?! They didn't touch me
in our earlier skirmish. But any amount of chakra can be
sucked out through your insects! Well, there's no way
I can disprove that… However, I am the real me. And I'm the real me! So am I. This is a futile argument. That's because none of us can
prove that we are truly ourselves. I know! If we can't trust each other,
let's go our own way! I'll find the remaining one
on my own! Let's go, Akamaru! Kiba! It seems we don't trust
each other either… Thank goodness!
Can you give me a hand? What happened?! The second victim… How terrible… There is a fake among us, after all. What's the big idea?! Don't pretend! The victim was holding this! From the scent,
it's a piece ripped from your clothes! Shino! You're the fake! You suddenly started talking
about fakes and what not. I had my doubts about you
from the start! That piece got ripped off
in the explosion. And besides,
if I were the fake, why would I even bring it up? You probably figured
if you bring it up first, no one would suspect you! But, damn it, I wouldn't fall
for something like that! Get ready! Hold it, Kiba! Hinata! If we let the fake one
manipulate us, we'll end up killing each other! That's exactly what they want! We're just playing
into their hands! There's one thing I know
for sure in this situation. Just one of us is the fake. That's because if
they were both fake, they would attack me
without hesitation. In other words, whoever it is,  they're waiting for me and
the other real one to destroy each other. Then what do you intend to do?! Stay here like this until
who knows when? I just have one good idea. Rock-Paper-Scissors. Huh?! Are you serious?
Rock-Paper-Scissors? Yes. The loser must answer
every question the other two poses. Why can't we just take
turns answering? Nope, Rock-Paper-Scissors. I don't get why we're doing
Rock-Paper-Scissors here. – Rock-Paper-Scissors!
– Rock-Paper-Scissors! I won… – Rock-Paper-Scissors!
– Rock-Paper-Scissors! What are your favorite things? Beef jerky and
walking with Akamaru. Fine. Next. Rock-Paper-Scissors! Rock-Paper-Scissors! Rock-Paper… Say, do we have to do
the Paper-Scissors-Rock part? This is the most important part. Rock-Paper-Scissors. I-I lose… What are your favorite things? I like…sweet things. Huh? That's a lie. What? What's wrong? C'mon, what you like
is Naruto, right? A-Are these the type of
questions we're asking?! Kidding! Just kidding! Next. I was just joking. Never mind, let's continue. Okay, okay. Rock-Paper-Scissors! Rock-Paper-Scissors! You lost. So here's my question. Only the real Shino would
know the answer! When we went after Sasuke, you were the only one
left behind. How did you feel about that? I cannot answer that question. In fact, I don't want to answer. No fair! If you play like that,
this whole thing is pointless! If you want to know the truth,
take me down. What? There's meaning in this… Rock-Paper-Scissors! Rock-Paper-Scissors! I won again! One more time… What's the point of
saying it out loud like this? This is the most crucial part. Rock-Paper-Scissors! It's your turn, Shino. The game's over. Huh?! Who are you to
make the rules?! I've been thinking… With Captain Yamato
held captive, it's not unusual for them to
obtain personal intel about us. They went as far as getting
personal data on us?! Of course. That's because part of their strategy
is to impersonate one of us. Because of that, the thoughts and habits of
each person are crucial. Sure, if you put it that way. So everything we've been
doing is meaningless? Don't make me keep
repeating myself. Doing Rock-Paper-Scissors
has a purpose. I don't trust both of you, after all. I'm bringing both of you down! Shino! Whose side are you on?! Damn it! Fine, I'll fight you! Let's do it, Akamaru! Fang Over Fang! Kiba! I'll assist! I'm sure he's the fake! I won't let you get away! With these flames,
you can't use your insects! Get ready! Take this…Fang Over Fang! Ki…ba… We did it! Now we can escape. That's true…just me. What?! Akamaru?! Ta-da! The star of the show appears! So you're the fake! I was so nervous that you'd start
asking touchy questions. Like he said, the things we got out of Yamato,
about you, were really helpful. As a result, you guys had a falling out
and saved me a lot of trouble. Without your mutt,
even I can beat you. So the Shino I fought was real. I'm so stupid! You're right. That's because
you're really stupid. You finally showed your true colors. Huh? You're alive? How? Because of you, I had to sacrifice so
many of my precious insects. Insects… Then the one I defeated earlier
was an Insect Clone?! Exactly. How did you know that
I was the fake?! I didn't know which one
was fake. It was on my mind, from the time the three of us
faced each other. Even if there was
a fake among us, if it was possible
to stay transformed, could we really fight in earnest? Gentle Fist! Gotcha! If we trust a comrade, can we really allow ourselves
to bring down that person? Then I started thinking about
something even more ridiculous. If I'm going to be defeated
by someone like that, then maybe it was for the best. And then, it became clear. I'll have me, the real me,
get taken down. Then it would be guaranteed that
you would reveal yourself. That's what
the Rock-Paper-Scissors was for. Rock-Paper-Scissors? Those were hand signals. What's the point of saying it
out loud like this? This is the most crucial part. After he said that,
I started to figure it out. Back then, the message
you gave me was… "Follow my instructions." And after that… If you want to know the truth,
take me down. I wasn't completely sure
what you meant, but when you came at me… I reacted and… It all worked out. Thanks to you taking down
my clone, he revealed himself. And since you read my signals,
you're the real Kiba. So you played
a dirty little trick on me? Well then, I'll just take
on the two of you! It's useless! That's because you are
already completely under my jutsu! I'm avenging the two you killed! Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Tornado! Thank you, Shino. I must say though… I had misgivings about
fighting a comrade, but you had no qualms about using your
Fang Over Fang on me. You told me to! Besides, you're the one
who came at me first! I didn't know which one
was the fake, so I had to attack. But there's no way
I would attack a girl. Quit acting chivalrous! We brought down the fake… but where's the real Hinata? Are you all right, Hinata?! Kiba… Akamaru… Oh, Shino. I was the last one, huh… What happened anyway? Nothing much. However, with this incident,
the most closely guarded secret of the Allied Shinobi Force was
almost leaked to the enemy. Most closely guarded secret? That you love Naruto. Huh?! How? Kiba was teasing you
and it slipped out. S-Stupid! What're you saying?! Well, those guys… It seems in order
to impersonate us, they've got all sorts of personal intel
from Captain Yamato! Wait… Does that mean they know
that secret, which only Captain Yamato knows? Including that secret from that time… Even a secret like this? I'm going to destroy them! Each and every one of them!! – Right!
– Right! Hmm?! Sasuke, how are you
still alive?

 Where's Naruto?

 I don't know!


Recognize me! Hmm!

 I only have business with Naruto.

 Damn you, not again.

 You still won't acknowledge me.

 No.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Aesthetics of an Artist"

 I'll wipe that smug expression
off your face!

﻿1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,130
At midday in ten days, go to the Tenchi Bridge located in
the Village Hidden in the Grass! I've got a spy working as one
of Orochimaru's subordinates... I was supposed to rendezvous...
with him...there... Things have gotten quiet
at the enemy hideout. Has the fight been settled? Neji, can you hear me?! <i>What's happening
at the enemy hideout?!</i> Give me...a minute. It looks like
the fight's been settled. You say the fight's been settled? Then! Sakura--! S-Sakura! What's going on with Sakura?! Sakura's okay.
They're both walking. I see! So they beat one
of the Akatsuki! I'd expect no less from Sakura. <i>But things have
gotten problematic...</i> <i>What do you mean?</i> There were actually
two Akatsuki members in the hideout... Even though one of them
has been defeated, this Jutsu hasn't worn off...! Which means... the other one cast the Jutsu... or... It's a Jutsu that won't wear off even
if the caster has been defeated? <i>There's a possibility.</i> That means we just have to... defeat our clones, right?! <i>Beasts: Alive Again!


</i> Granny Chiyo! I'll heal you now! <i>But this won't be
an ultimate solution.</i> <i>I've got to do something...</i> <i>about the poison that
entered her body...</i> <i>I used up all of the antidotes
I made with the ingredients</i> <i>that could be procured
in the Hidden Sand Village.</i> <i>If I make arrangements
right now</i> <i>and have the ingredients
transported to the Hidden Sand Village...</i> <i>we just might make it in time.</i> Let's hurry back to the village. I'll make another antidote
immediately... No... Why?! We've finished what
we were supposed to do. We need to return
to the village and neutralize
the poison immediately... More importantly... I've still got... something I must...do. <i>A new Sharingan...</i> What is it? Kakashi Sensei...
It's okay if you fail. I'll make sure I settle things
in the end! Right... If your turn comes around... Right! <i>What's this...?</i> <i>Just as I thought...</i> Hey... Aren't these guys
becoming stronger than before? Indeed, he's begun hitting me
with powerful shots... No, the enemy hasn't gotten stronger. Exactly... We've gotten weaker. We've gotten weaker...? What do you mean, Neji? Can you...
tell us the reason why? It's very simple. This Jutsu probably... <i>All right! Everyone!
We'll remove the tags on three!</i> <i>One... two... three!</i> It copies precisely at that moment, the ability and form of
the person who removed the tags... and then they attack. That's why we've had trouble
finishing them off. But unlike them,
we're flesh-and-blood humans. If a fight drags on,
we get tired. And the execution of our Jutsu
and our movements worsen... So it feels like the enemies
have gotten a lot stronger... Then the longer
the fight drags on, the more fatigued we become and...
we'll be at a disadvantage! <i>That's about the size of it.</i> No way! Even so... we must not...lose here! Oh no! Damn you...! Damn it! <i>Sakura...</i> Lee?! What's the matter?!
What happened? <i>Oh! It's so simple...</i> What do you mean? <i>I figured it out!</i> I figured out how to
beat these guys! What?! Really?! How do we beat them?! It's a surefire method, right? Yes! It's an absolutely
surefire method! We just have to get stronger... than we were when
we first encountered these guys. The enemy just copied our strength... at the moment
we removed the tags. So! If we get stronger than
we were at that point, we can definitely beat them! Good job noticing that, Lee!
That's my favorite pupil. It may sound logical, but there's no way
we can get stronger just like that! <i>Have you forgotten, Tenten?</i> <i>Have you forgotten
the motto from our training?!</i> Stronger than you were yesterday! With those words
engraved in our hearts... we endured harsh training! What's the matter?!
Are you done already?! You're no better than
you were yesterday! W-We're just getting started... We won't give up
at the same point as yesterday. We've got to...get stronger... Stronger than you were yesterday! Stronger than you were yesterday! Stronger than you were yesterday! - Stronger than you were yesterday!
- Stronger than you were yesterday! As a result of our training,
Tenten and I became Chunin... And Neji became a Jonin! It's a result of
our continuous efforts to get stronger than
we were yesterday! But are we all satisfied
with who we are right now?! I...I... I want to be better
than I was yesterday! Half a day ago... A minute ago! I'm going... to be better! I've never once thought that
being a Jonin was my final goal! I've no intention of toning things down...
any time soon! I've no intention...of dropping...out! Youth...at full power! 8 Trigrams... Hazan Strike! Weapon Control... Tensasai! Great...Leaf Flash! Yeah! Sorry to keep you guys waiting! Next time, Kakashi Sensei
will finally unleash his new Jutsu! He'll pound on that Deidara! That's right! Kakashi Sensei tends to put on airs
and prolongs things... Plus he's good at
giving suggestive ideas, while dodging our questions. But when push comes to shove,
he always gets tough! That's true! He hasn't aged
all these years for nothing! Go get 'em, Kakashi Sensei! Do your best, belated hero! Um...you two? If you're going to cheer for me, can't you at least do it
a bit more seriously? Next time:
"Kakashi Enlightened!" It happened again! There are reports from
every sector that our comrades are being ambushed
one after another! There's confusion everywhere! We don't know who the enemy is! What's going on?! A night raid is supposed
to have been ruled out! On top of that, we added security and
positioned Sensory-type ninja… Why can't we detect the enemy?! Is it some kind of poison? What's the condition of the corpses? All of them have external wounds. They're physical attacks. No doubt they're controlling
Allied shinobi with genjutsu. Could it be Itachi? Hold on! We just got word from
the Medical Corps. The enemy looks to be… White Zetsu transformed into
Allied Force shinobi! They're able to mirror chakra imprints! That explains it… So during the day battle, if one of our shinobi got
his chakra absorbed, White Zetsu can transform
into him completely! What should we do,
Shikaku of the Leaf? There is no way we can weed out
who is friend and who is foe! How will we prepare for
the battle at dawn? If we don't find
the enemy immediately, we'll not only lose precious time, but our own men will
become casualties! In the end, they could
end up killing each other! So this is the power of White Zetsu. The battle during the day was
simply to set up the night… This was the enemy's true motive. Aesthetics of an Artist

 There's no sign of enemy movement. Okay, but stay alert. Yes. I have look-outs
posted everywhere. Halt! Who goes there?! I'm an ally. Kurotsuchi of the Hidden Stone,
from the Second Company. I've come to speak with the prisoner. I'm here to relieve you. Okay. Thanks. Get some rest. We'll keep watch. Okay. It's so tacky to exhibit
one's Ultimate Art, over and over! But I guess I have no choice, hmm! Lightning Style?! I was being careful too, since I'm susceptible to
the Lightning Style. Deidara… Deidara. Stop casually calling out
my name like that! It's me, Zetsu. Zetsu? Is that you?! You were a fun guy. I'm going to help you
for old time's sake. Thanks. Quickly! Hurry. Hold on a second… Oh that? In there? What is it? So Big Bro Deidara, you still alive? I'm dead. That voice… Is that you, Kurotsuchi? Did you come to rescue me
for old time's sake? I was sent here because
we used to be friends, but the situation's just
the opposite now. I came because I need your help. Huh? What do you mean by that? She's interrogating
the Hidden Stone ninja. Where is Kabuto Yakushi? How should I know! I wouldn't tell you even if I knew, hmm. Look, Bro… Kabuto brought you back to life and is now using you at
his convenience. You're dead, so the least
you can do is forget the past, and cooperate with us a little. Kabuto gave me an opportunity
to acquire the Super Ultimate Art. All right.
Then where is Sasuke Uchiha? Sasuke, you say? Are you saying
he was reanimated, as well? Sasuke's not dead! Don't be ridiculous! I killed him with my Ultimate Art! But I saw him. After you died Bro,
Sasuke was alive and well. He was fighting with the Raikage
and the others. A-Amazing. He joined the Akatsuki and
is an enemy of the Allied Forces. He's with the Akatsuki?! Right? Huh?! Yeah, I guess. What's with that? Sasuke's alive?
And he's a member of Akatsuki? You've gotta be kidding. In death, I will become art. This never-before-seen explosion will leave a never-before-seen scar
on this land. And…! My art will win
never-before-seen admiration! Now, tremble with fear! Be in awe! Despair! Scream! My art is… An explosion! There's no way
he could still be alive! I'm telling you he's alive. That was my Ultimate Art! Nobody cares about art. Sasuke, that bastard! What's with that guy?!
Wasn't he in awe? Didn't he tremble with fear?
Didn't he despair? Didn't he scream,
"What the hell is this?!"? The Earth Style is vulnerable
to the Lightning Style. Your explosives won't detonate
against my Lightning Style. Isn't that your weakness? Screw you, Sasuke! Your Lightning Style won't
hold me down forever! Commander Mifune!
An urgent message from Headquarters! The enemy has infiltrated
the Allied Forces and are assassinating people! Chaos is spreading within
all the companies! Is this company in any danger? Not at the moment. Yes, sir! I will relay your reply. Sir, what about
the Hidden Stone kunoichi earlier? I don't think she's an enemy. Bro? Hey, are you listening, Bro?
Answer me! This isn't getting anywhere! Open it. I want to speak
with him directly. You want me to open it? Hey. Sir! Mountain. Huh? Mountain… Distant skies? It's "River." Damn samurai! You're so predictable. You bastards! They're Zetsu! What?! Careful! They'll absorb your chakra! Art is…an explosion. Deidara! How?! Why didn't the Lightning Style
seal his Explosion Style?! Is that how you channeled
the Lightning Style away? What was that doing
inside the puppet?! It was thanks to me… Zetsu. What? Let's get out of here! Huh? Wait! Don't let him get away! Man, he's troublesome
even when he's dead! The prisoner, Deidara,
has escaped. He's with his comrade, Zetsu.
Apprehend them! Okisuke. I will take full responsibility
for my blunder, I swear! This is not the time for regrets.
After them! Yes, sir! Why are we running? Let's kill them! I'm out of Detonating Clay. I need to get more somewhere. Uh-oh… They're coming! You're in my way! In front, too! Damn it! Still weak as ever, aren't you? That was a tactic to
give us more time. Looks like you escaped the seal. Kabuto! I would've expected nothing less.
I'll take that back. Wait! My Ultimate Art was
completely rejected! I can't die like this… even if I'm already dead. Hmm. You intend to stand and fight there? I'm going to perfect
my Super Ultimate Art! I just don't understand
how you artists think. But intellectuals have
to protect artists. That's… Get away. I'll hold them off. I'll leave them to you, Chukichi! Hidden Frost Jutsu. What the hell?! Where is he hiding? That's…a lot of 'em. He's gone! Curses! I sense them! Commander Mifune!
They went that way! Let's go. How much farther
are we going to run? I need clay, hmm! I need to find a place
with clay in the soil. Leave that to me. Fight as you see fit, Deidara.
Freedom suits you well. Besides, I'm going to be busy. Unless we catch Big Bro Deidara
before he finds some clay, this could get troublesome. Previously, Omoi of the Cloud
contained the explosion with his Lightning Style, but he's is in a different unit now. Do we have anyone in this unit
who can handle lightning? Fifth Company split into two. Our company's main weapon
is samurai. Our only ninja are sensory, sealing,
and intel support personnel. Commander Mifune,
I am able to do Lightning Style. Good… They're coming, Deidara!
Our pursuers! What?! I've only managed to get
this much Detonating Clay! Scatter! Lightning Style! What's happening?! Did Big Bro—?! Under us! Land mines! Jump! You're not gonna stop us! Take that! Not enough, hmm. This is art! Big Bro's gonna explode. You have to keep discharging it! We need a more powerful
Lightning Style! Th-This is the best I can do! Lord Mifune! Hey, Deidara… Hey, what's happening to me? A reanimated body is immortal. In a way, you're like
a walking Detonating Clay Bomb. I suspected that. How tacky! The despair, hmm! Why? Art is a moment of brilliance, blossoms that scatter all at once. But this body can't scatter! I'm going to find
a Super Ultimate Art that transcends
the Ultimate Art, hmm. Damn you, Bro! Lord Mifune? Where are you? Lord Mifune! The holes left by his landmines
became trenches. Bro Deidara wasn't very thorough
with his Detonating Clay, was he? We'll need a plan. With insulation, we could keep him from channeling
away the Lightning Style. The problem is
our Lightning Style wielder. But…I'm not… You just concentrate on
sensing their whereabouts. Shall I request Headquarters
for reinforcements? We don't have time to wait
for reinforcements. We'll do this with
the personnel we have. What am I going to do? This immortal body and
my aesthetic are incompatible. Sasori might be able
to do something. But he went off quickly. I'm all alone. But artists are loners
to begin with, hmm. I buried the landmines. Well? Got any ideas? Art doesn't come to one that easily. Especially not a Super Ultimate Art! Sasuke?! Why are you here? It's you guys… Bastard! Why are you alive?! Where's Naruto? I don't know! Right now, pay attention to me, hmm! My business is with Naruto. Damn it, not that again! First Itachi, now Naruto?! You really don't give
a damn about me, do you?! Nope. Bastard! They're coming! See ya. Stop! Deidara! Don't let them get away! You're not getting away! Deidara! Wait! Sasuke didn't seem… This time,
I'll make you tremble with fear! You'll be awed! You'll feel despair. I'll wipe that smug expression
off your face! I see! There! Over there! I knew it. Your weakness
isn't Lightning Style, Bro. It's your stupid obsession with art! Kurotsuchi?! Bastards! What's the meaning of this? A dud? Dammit! That sword won't stop my art! A samurai using Lightning Style?! It's not Lightning Style. A storage cell… Looks like
you know how to use one. I don't! What the—?! This is all bedrock, Bro. The sword can't penetrate. Even if it could, it won't let
the Lightning Style discharge. Damn it! Hey! Let me go! All right. And one other thing, Bro. Where is the real Sasuke right now? Damn it, Kurotsuchi.
Don't treat me like a fool! Pretending to be Sasuke!
You even looked like him! Screw you! Yeah, I suppose it's no use trying
to get info out of you, Bro. You're totally screwed. We're heading back. We'll maintain our original frontline. Inform Headquarters. Commander, could I have that back? Don't bother us again,
Bro Deidara! See ya! That might work, hmm! I've decided the theme of
my Super Ultimate Art! That thing could use a face! Art will never die! Even if I'm dead..hmm! While all the shinobi
are away fighting

 in the 4th great shinobi war,

 we need to be prepared
to protect the village!

 There's a chance the enemy
may come for us as well!

 We've had incidents
like that before,

 and every time,
we beat the crap out of them!

 Don't underestimate the mothers
of the Leaf Village!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Allied Mom Force!"

 Protecting the village is also
an important duty!

                  THE ALLIED MOM FORCE!

 Tune in again!

 It's been kind of lonely around here,
ever since the Great Ninja War began… Wow! It's amazing! Oh! You ants are hard at work! Your children are waiting for you
with hungry bellies… Hang in there! Taku, what are you doing?! I couldn't hold it any longer! The Allied Mom Force!

 The elite ninja of
the Hidden Leaf formed a ninja alliance unprecedented in the history of
the Five Great Nations to fight the Fourth Great Ninja War. The question before us, as we worry about
the well-being of our families, is how are we going to protect
the village in their absence? We are warriors, too! In the past, each time
there was a Great Ninja War, our village was left short-handed, and several rogue bands came after
our valuables, like vultures. Such a thing happened… We, who remain, must unite and… What're you babbling on about? We've had incidents like that before, and every time, we beat
the crap out of them! Oh no… – Isn't that Big Brother Shikamaru's mother?
– What I'm trying to say is… She's really intense! Uh…yeah… That's right! The Leaf
Mom's Association has been around since our mothers' time. Don't underestimate the mothers
of the Leaf Village! Big Sis Sakura's mother is
pretty fired up, too. Everyone's afraid of us.
No one's going to come! Right, Mrs. Inoichi? That's right. That's right. W-Well, l… That might have
been true in the past… But I think we need
to consider the "what ifs." There's no telling when
a band of rogues like the Akatsuki might form again. And… I thought it'd be a good way
to raise our morale. Stop mumbling! We'll keep things as
it's always been. Right. We'll just keep on living
like we always have. Like it's always been… Laughing, crying, getting angry,
laughing again… And welcoming our husbands
back with smiles. If we do that, our lives will
go back to normal again. Yes! Good for you! Mind your own business,
four-eyes! What?! How dare you… Is it okay to leave things like this? What if Ebisu Sensei is right? What if rogues attack
the village? Shouldn't we be more worried
about how much we suck because we couldn't get
on the battlefield? Damn it!
I wish I'd been born sooner! Watase! You're so cool! But protecting the village is
also an important duty! Ninja earn their stripes
on the battlefield. Watching the village isn't going
to get us any praise! Gramps… What would you do
in this situation? You were a Hokage, so you'd be on the battlefield,
I suppose… Konohamaru… Do you possess… the Will of Fire? The Will of Fire? A strong will to protect this village. Protect this village… Konohamaru! Huh? Trouble! Big trouble! What's this about? Okay, so just a while ago… Mom asked me to get her
some medicinal herbs, so I went the mountain on the east side
of the village to pick some. And then… What?! You saw some suspicious ninja
running through the forest?! That's right, Konohamaru. There were so many. Maybe about a hundred! A hundred ninja? K-Konohamaru,
we're in big trouble! What happened, Udon?!
Your head? Listen, Konohamaru! I went to the eastern forest to pick matsutake mushrooms,
when I saw… When everyone comes back
from battle, I'm going to feed them
delicious matsutake mushrooms. I'll roast these
fragrant matsutake and… Hot! It was a flaming inferno! Yummy! Right? I can't wait.
I'm gonna eat them now. The way these were roasted…hmm… A Fire-Style ninja…
one with extreme skill… What's wrong? On the western side
of the village… What?! On the west side now?! There were humongous giants! A giant ninja, huh? What's a giant ninja? It's a ninja giant. That's the same thing! What the hell's going on? Listen! Listen to me! On the eastern side of the village… Now we're back to the east side! There was a ninja
who used Rasengan… Did Big Brother Naruto come back? It wasn't him! How can that be?! The only ones who
could use Rasengan were the late Fourth Hokage
and Uncle Jiraiya. Among the living, it's only
Big Brother Naruto and me! The guy created Rasengan
using his feet. His feet?! Yeah, and he kicked it! Even I can just barely throw
a Rasengan with my hands. Yet he can kick it?! It's a curse! Now what?! A Tailed Beast curses this village! T-Tailed Beast?! Tailed Beast! A Tailed Beast is attacking
the village again! Granny! Where did you see it?! In the forest to the east! Was it really a Tailed Beast? Yes. And this time, the Tailed Beast
was in bear form! It's a curse! – A bear?!
– A bear?! Wait a minute… If we sort through all
the information up until now… They're in the forest to the east…
And also in the west… In other words, they're nearby… We're in trouble! That's just not possible. If anything did come here,
those ladies would chase them away. I said what I said in hopes of
strengthening our unity… I should have just stayed
out of this. Konohamaru, enough dawdling. You should be training! Training! Lady! They're coming! It's them! A group of giant ninja is coming
to attack our unguarded village! Huh?! Breathing fire! My, my… Using the Rasengan! How frightening…. Attacking with a bear! We can't rely on the adults
any longer. We, the young generation,
will protect the village! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Konohamaru,
stop playing Hokage! I don't care if you are
the Third Hokage's grandson… What?! Look, from now on,
real skills are what count. That's how it was for Naruto. The loser of the Academy is
now the hero of the village. Rumor has it, he's closest to becoming
the Hokage after the next one. These days, connections don't matter. What counts is what you've
accomplished on the battlefield. No one cares about looking
after the village! What?! How selfish are you? Wanna fight? All right! Let's go! Do you have it in you?! The Will of Fire! What the hell is that?! Konohamaru! Konohamaru! It's the will to protect this village! Someone without the Will of Fire
can't become a Hokage! And you do?! Y-You… I don't want to hurt you. I'm the one who's hurting you. If I died by your kunai, you would be
the one to get hurt. That's why I'm trying desperately
not to die! Konohamaru! No matter what,
I'm going to protect the village! Even if it ends up
being for one person. Konohamaru, where are you going? Wait, Konohamaru! Moegi, is this where you saw them? Yeah. This is close to
where I saw them, too. Huh? What…? What's the matter? Ninja jumping from
branch to branch… Fire-breathing fire ninja… Ninja who throw Rasengan
with their feet… A Tailed Beast in bear form… We fled the Land of Frost and
have come to the Leaf Village. We are the Illusion Circus.
Please remember us! "The real ghost was all
in our imagination," as the saying goes. What're you talking about? How could you mistake
a circus troupe for ninja?! But this sucks. I made such a scene… This is so uncool! – What?
– What? Big trouble, K-Konohamaru! They're coming, just like you said! No, they're actually… From the western forest!
Without warning! The west?! Anyway, Watase told me
to get you! Come with me! W-Wait a minute… We are the Sumo Wrestlers! The group that comes after
the ninja and samurai! This village now belongs
to me, Yokozuna! Sumo Wresters?! Never heard of them! A group of giants in the west forest… On the west side of the village… There were humongous giants! I get it now! This piece of intel was
the only real one! C'mon! Hang on, Watase! I'll be right there! Just a minute! – What?
– What? Out of our way! Your husbands aren't here because
they're away at war, right? While the devils are gone, we're going to take every valuable
you have in the village! So guys like you
are still around, I see. Hah! What a joke. Whether our husbands
are here or not, the Mom's Association
will protect this village with our Will of Fire! Will of Fire… Hogwash. Go teach these women a lesson! Give it to them! Protect the children! Awesome… To those who possess
the Will of Fire, everyone is family. The desire to protect one's family
builds thicker and stronger bonds between each and every one
in the village. If the Will of Fire is embraced
by everyone, the village will be all right,
no matter what happens. Gramps, so this is the true meaning
of the Will of Fire… R-Retreat…damn it! We've had enough! You're not getting away! Hey! Konohamaru! Out of the way! Move! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Take this! Rasengan! I've got to hand it to you, Konohamaru…
You are something. I'll carry on the Will of Fire! Huh? Guys! Let's lift him up to celebrate! Huh…no… You don't have to… Up you go! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! It's almost suppertime. Both Ino and my husband
aren't here, so I guess it's leftovers again. It's too much trouble to cook
just for my husband who's just lying around the house… What do you say
we all have a potluck? That's a great idea.
I'll bring our leftovers from lunch. Let's do that! Konohamaru is our true leader! Big Brother Naruto's got
nothing on him! I could get used to this. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Bro, please let Naruto go!

 If you insist on going,
I will kill Naruto!

 I'll make sure he do
what he gotta do!

 Why are you defending him, Bee?

 Bro, are you now unable to read
my soul when we bump fists?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Secret Origin of
the Ultimate Tag Team!"

 Because to me, you're…

THE SECRET ORIGIN OF
THE ULTIMATE TAG TEAM!

 THE SECRET ORIGIN OF
THE ULTIMATE TAG TEAM!

 Tune in again!

 What's wrong? The enemy is disguising
themselves as allies! Maybe you're an enemy! We can't trust anyone! What's going on?! There's murkiness spreading
everywhere! G-Granny?! No! B-Bro… B-Bra… Bee! How dare you stare at
the Hokage's chest when I'm standing
right in front of you! Oh no, Bro! I meant no offense.
I'm just shocked, is all. The Hokage's jugs are
definitely immense. We're here to stop you! You will not pass! The Secret Origin of
the Ultimate Tag Team

 So this is what Naruto
looks like when he's in control of
the Nine Tails' power… You did it, Naruto. S-Such immense chakra! Bro! Let Naruto go…
This is a personal plea. I can vouch for him.
That I'll guarantee. Silence! We are fighting
this war to protect you two! If you guys are captured… The enemy has perfected their jutsu
and the world is about to end. Isn't that right?
Iruka Sensei told us! If you know that,
why are you going? Are you crazy?! It's because of that! It's because they're protecting us! I can't stand it that
people are dying for me! If they die fighting
and we win this war… and I'm the only left standing…
It's not worth it! I don't want that! It's better than the world ending! We all believe that.
That's why we're fighting, prepared to sacrifice
ourselves to protect you! You think that I can just sit here, unharmed and do nothing
when I know that? I'm not that kind of a guy! Besides… Don't try to talk your way out!
You will not pass! If you won't listen to me… Can you keep up with me
in this Mode? What is that punch?
Damn, it's powerful! I'd better avoid a direct hit. Granny Tsunade,
you understand me, don't you?! I'll stop this war! Let me go! Granny… We are now part of
the Allied Shinobi Force. These orders are from
the Allied Forces. Even though I am the Hokage,
I cannot act independently! Okay. I understand the position
you're in, Granny. So, I'll force my way outta here! This time, I'll do it faster. How's this?! You're fast, old man Raikage… No… It's amazing that when
you're in Nine-Tail Chakra Mode, you can match
the Raikage's speed. There's no shinobi faster than me. Not since the Fourth Hokage! You knew my dad?! We fought many times. I came to believe that
no one could ever defeat him. FOURTH HOKAGE





I understand that Jiraiya
of the Legendary Sannin FOURTH HOKAGE





called him the Child of Prophecy…
the savior of the world. So why is this savior
not around to stop this crisis? Because he failed during
the incident of the Nine Tails! You are his son, yet you haven't
learned anything from that. Only a fool speaks without knowing
the probability… If that's all… If that's all you can say,
don't talk about my dad. And you were born. Minato cried and said,
"From today, I'm a father!" And… His words were,
"I'd gladly die for my son." He sealed half of
the overpowering chakra of the Nine Tails in himself. The upheaval in the world… Dealing with the calamity
and Madara… He left it to his son. Naruto, he entrusted everything
to you and died. My dad… He believed in you
with all his heart. The Fourth Hokage did not fail! If you…insist on going… I will kill you right here! Wha—?! Hey, Raikage! This way, we'll be able
to buy some time until the Nine Tails is revived. And the enemy will be forced
to postpone their plans! Looks like you want to die. Wait! Bee, you…! Oh… He was saved! If that's the case,
why don't I, the Eight Tails, die? Then the enemy's plans
will also go awry. If Naruto can go to the battlefield…
my life is one I'd gladly yield. Octopops… Raikage! You cannot make
any arbitrary decisions without consulting the other
Allied Shinobi Force leaders. You may be the Supreme Commander,
but I will not allow it! My responsibility is to make sure
we win this war! No matter what it takes! Then as Eight Tails said,
why are you targeting Naruto? When the time comes, as Raikage, I will be prepared to kill
my own younger brother! But right now…
I choose to kill Naruto over Bee! Because Bee is the Jinchuriki who is able to control
the Tailed Beast's power… That makes him
a stronger military weapon! Unhand me, Bee! No way, fool ya fool! You and Jinchuriki like you do not
exist solely for yourselves! You maintain the balance
of power between nations. You are the strength of your village! To the all the nations and your village,
you are a special existence! You can't just do as you please! You must understand
the circumstances, you fools! Sure, that may be so… But there's something personal
called spirit that I can't abandon… Without that,
I'm just another weapon. Why are you defending him, Bee? We're bumping fists… But you can't read
what's in my soul, Bro? Doesn't seem like there's any
good prospects this time… Listen up! Only one of you is worthy
enough inherit the title of "Bee." Ay here is a candidate
to become the next Raikage! You all know that… Here in the Hidden Cloud, each Raikage is assigned
a tag team partner. Someone who will bring out
the Raikage's full power. And to be "Bee" is to be
the bodyguard of the Raikage. We'll now test your
compatibility with Ay. You will team up with Ay
and attempt to behead this rubber dummy
using the Double Lariat! Remember!
To do this right, equal strength must be
applied from both sides! If one side is weaker or stronger,
it will only bend! First, bump fists with Ay and determine how much power
you should use. Then execute the Double Lariat
on the dummy! All right!
We'll start from that end! I'm honored, sir! Next! Yes sir! Next. Yes sir… Next! Right! Next… Yes sir! Next… – Yes sir!
– Looks like we won't find – anyone this time either. If he'd had a real sibling, we wouldn't have had to go
through all this… Next… L-Lord Raikage… It seems we found him. You're kind of an odd one.
Bump fists with me again! We are brothers from this day on! I'm counting on you, Bee! Let's go, Bee! Your plan suits me just fine.
We'll bump our fists every time. Okay, Bro! Eat up! You have to get strong quickly
or our powers won't be in synch! Okay, Bro! Our mission this time
is to recover a scroll. Don't tell me you already… Okay? Bro? Is he asleep? Yeah… Bee is a good shinobi.
He's got talent too. Although his rapping leaves
much to be desired… I agree. Probably after me, this boy will become
the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails. Is that what you've heard
from the elders? No… No one's told me anything yet. My old man, my uncle…
They all failed. I'm not compatible either. Listen, as your cousin… But look, you have
the Eight Tails under control… – Right now…
– Just listen! Only those who are
Jinchuriki can understand. Friends and acquaintances start
to look at you differently after. Well, they probably think
they're treating you the same, but you begin to see
that they're not. There's no turning back. You can only look
toward the future… One that is filled with
darkness and loneliness. Have you really
achieved compatibility…? If you walk through life with the shadow of
your own death beside you? It fills your mind
day in and day out… and you begin to lose sight
of who you are. You feel a hole in your heart. And the Tailed Beast waits to pounce on that weak heart
and run wild. When you live with
the constant fear of death, you start wanting to die. But you have a knack for ninjutsu, you have the skill
and the ancestry… You have everything
going for you! Yeah… That's exactly
the reasoning they used when they chose me as
the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki. But… that's not what's essential
to become a Jinchuriki. So what is it? Having something that can
fill the void in your heart! What is this "something"? Just "something"! If I can find it,
I feel I can stay strong. Let Bee find that something. Another failure. This time, eight people
were victims of his rampage. Because of the number of tails, the Eight Tails is that much harder
to control than the Two Tails. How long is this going to continue? The next Jinchuriki is
supposed to be… you know, that boy. Such prestige, so immense… The Eight Tails' name
gave you presence… Now I offer you incense… Whee! I don't think he'll make it… Th-This kid… How could he do this
to our comrades?! Treating us with such contempt! Let's go, Bee! Okay, Bro! Bee?! This brat?! So this means
you're the A/B Combo? So you're familiar
with our technique? D-Double Lariat?! Bee, we still have
a long way to go before the Double Lariat is ideal. Right now, I'm toning down
my power to match yours. You have to become stronger! I-I know! Fool, ya fool! How dare you address your
older brother as "fool, ya fool"?! It's the Iron Claw for you! I'll surpass you someday,
you'll see. On that day, I'll be carefree. The trick to this technique is
keeping both our powers equal. So you have to come up to par! That sounds ideal to me.
Talking down to you is my fantasy. You can fantasize after
you master the Lariat! Tonight…we will seal
the Eight Tails in Bee. Right… Having something that can fill
the void in your heart! If I can find it,
I feel I can stay strong. Let Bee find that something. What is it, Bro? You will now become a Jinchuriki. Things won't be the same anymore. It will be extremely tough. No kidding?
It's always been like that. I'll just give the octopus
a nickname as I rap. Listen up, Bee… Always tell me everything, got it? You are special to me! We are the ultimate tag team. Even if he does have
the Steel Shell Seal, I wouldn't be surprised if
the Eight Tails starts acting up. We'd better stay on it
and watch him. Wheee! The Eight Tails is me,
the cool Killer Bee! Yay! The blonde hair and
the Teleportation Jutsu! That's definitely
the Yellow Flash, right?! Then we've gotta
get out of here! So he's the one who
singlehandedly prevented the recovery of the Nine Tails! And you are Unruly Ay, son of the Hidden Cloud's
Third Raikage. Rumors say that
you are extremely fast yourself. With Brother and me,
we're gonna get you, fool ya fool! Everyone, stay out of this. I will take care of this! He countered me
at my top speed? What's this? Forgive me, Bee. Are you all right?! No way… Is he…
the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki?! It's the signal to evacuate! Minato! We'll retreat for now! This is child's play! Eight Tails is the cool Killer Bee…
That's me! You have amazing prowess. Not as the Jinchuriki
of the Eight Tails… But as a shinobi, it seems you
possess something very powerful. He's got more natural talent
than me! No, I don't mean that. He possesses something
more precious. Huh?! Ay… You have a fine family. As do I. In any case,
the next time we meet… I suspect we'll be fighting
as one Kage against another. If you don't figure out what your little brother considers
most precious to him… he will be neither a Jinchuriki
nor a human. Don't try to fool me
with that nonsense! You are not getting away! The Teleportation Jutsu goes
where the kunai are… I've noted the location of
most of the kunai marked with the jutsu formula. If I can figure out
which one he'll pop up at, I can get him using
my top speed. I've got my own responsibilities… Go fly! Now! Which kunai will it be? So I won't fail. On the Eight Tails' tentacles… There's a Teleportation
Jutsu Formula! Was that when…? Fine, let's do it, one on one. We'll stab at each other
and get it done! You are my foe…
but I like you. You definitely got the moves
of a shinobi killer… Even if you kill Naruto
to buy us some time

 until Nine Tails
comes back to life,

 I can't see the next Jinchuriki
managing to control

 Nine Tail's power to this degree!

 Since we have no idea
which way this war will go,

 I say we use all the weapons
we've got,

 and not keep the Jinchuriki
in hiding!

 I will let Naruto pass!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Two Suns"


 Now you're talking!
That's the Granny Hokage I know!
TWO SUNS


 TWO SUNS


 Tune in again!

 This is my chance! Damn it! No doubt! He's fast! But…I'll try one more time! He's so fast, I can't track them! Do you think you can beat me
with your Lariat?! Octopops! If you have time to worry
about someone, worry about… Why, Bee?! Don't you get it yet, Bro?
Fool, ya fool! Thanks, Octopops! Now I can get away from
the Raikage… No! Hokage! You help too! Lady Tsunade… I'm not giving up… Don't try to protect me!
Naruto, stop! If you die, your dreams,
everything will be gone! I'm all right. Enough! Move! And run! Until I become Hokage,
there's no way… I'm gonna die. Granny! Hokage! You'd better have
a good excuse for this! Two Suns

 Hokage! You'd better have
a good excuse for this! Even if you kill Naruto to
buy us some time until the Nine Tails comes back to life, I can't see the next Jinchuriki
managing to control the Nine Tail's power,
 to this degree! Since we have no idea
which way this war will go, I say we use
all the weapons we've got, and not keep
the Jinchuriki in hiding! I will let Naruto pass! Nice excuse! I mean, now you're talking! That's the Granny Hokage I know! Hokage… Who's the one making
arbitrary decisions now?! Each one of you… What evidence do you have
that Naruto will succeed?! I already told you that
a Lariat like yours won't work! Bro, ever since you became
the Raikage, you've underestimated my power,
fool, ya fool! No one ever expected
the Third Raikage to die… Where's Bro?
Over there? Over here? All of a sudden, he started punching
his way out through the wall. There should be a bunch of holes
in the walls now. Follow them to find him. All right, will do… I'll look for Bro beyond
the walls I go through. Hang in there, Bro. From today,
you're the Raikage, y'know. I know that! We're in the middle of a war! As the Raikage, I will protect this village and
this nation to the very end! That is what my old man wanted! Bee! Starting today, you will go
to Unraikyo, the Storm Cloud Ravine, to work on
your Tailed Beast Bomb. You will not be engaging
the enemy. But my Lariat… I don't need your Lariat anymore! If the enemy attacks the village,
you will stay and take them out with
your long-range Tailed Beast Bomb! Remember! You are never to go
outside the village ever again! Bee, you and Naruto
are precious Jinchuriki! You are special to
your villages and nations. That's why I'm saying you cannot go! No matter how powerful
a Jinchuriki is, the others have been captured
by the Akatsuki and sealed. We ain't gonna lose,
Naruto and me. That I can personally guarantee. Fine, let's put it to the test! My Lariat against yours!
We'll see who's stronger! Bee, we still have
a long way to go before the Double Lariat is ideal. Right now, I'm toning down
my power to match yours. You have to become stronger! I'll surpass you some day, you'll see.
On that day, I'll be carefree. That sounds ideal to me.
Talking down to you is my fantasy. W-Wow…! See, with Naruto and me… it ain't just the power
of the Jinchuriki. We have something
stronger fundamentally. Your words to me, and me alone, before I became the Eight Tails… They'll keep me strong,
no matter what, even when all else fails. Just "something"! If I'm able to find it, I feel as though
I can stay strong. Let Bee find that something. I see… You are special to me! We are the ultimate tag team! What I said that day…
at the Waterfall of Truth…? So you finally understand,
fool, ya fool! Preaching at you from above
is my fantasy. The fantasy is now a reality, oh yeah! The enemy known as White Zetsu uses a Transformation Jutsu
that can even mimic chakra… Is there a way to see through
such a jutsu? Nothing in these papers either. Shouldn't we inform Lord Raikage
and Lady Hokage about this situation? No… We were put in charge here,
so we'll deal with it. Besides, we want them
to concentrate on stopping Naruto and Bee. Well, about that…
Lady Tsunade has already… I'm looking through
new information right now! It's imperative that we find
a solution right away! Please! Let me focus. You are very special to me… I do not deny that I said,
"We are the ultimate tag team." That's it? Just those words are enough
to keep you strong? I don't just live and fight
for the village and nation. I live and fight for you too, Bro! Still you're way
too overprotective, Bro. And you're losing faith
in my strength, y'know. You lose a lot as a Jinchuriki…
I tell ya, the heart grows empty. But it made me see what's dear to hold
and now my heart is made of gold Tailed Beast power isn't
my foundation! Okay?! Before the Tailed Beast
became my mate, something inside me
had started to illuminate. I saw that it was
as big as the sun. And that's my true power,
it's the one. That's why I can keep
the Eight Tails reined in. Naruto has the same sun deep within. And he has two of 'em, it's amazing.
Talk about a new innovation. You're right…
It really is like the sun. Naruto Uzumaki,
what are your two suns? My mom and dad! Your mother and father? The Fourth Hokage and
Kushina Uzumaki? But both of them died right
after you were born. He must have
experienced something while training to control
the Nine Tails' chakra. During Naruto's battle with Pain, he started transforming
into Nine Tails. Naruto mentioned
that Minato appeared and had put his essence
into the seal's formula to stop the transformation. I knew he wouldn't go down
without a fight! When I was trying to
control Nine Tails' power… Dad made sure to let me
meet my mom. He wove her chakra into the seal, so that if the Nine Tails' seal
was undone, Mom would come and see me. He did it all for me! The Fourth Hokage studied the unique Sealing Jutsu
of the Uzumaki Clan… And Kushina's chakra and
life force were powerful… It's possible. Just as I thought. When she gave me this power,
Mom told me everything. That long ago, Dad fought with
the same guy with the mask… And he learned two things… One was that this masked guy
would try to destroy the future. And the other was that… The only one who could stop him was the Jinchuriki who controlled
the Nine Tails… Me! A masked man…
Was it Madara? So Madara caused that Nine Tails'
incident in the Hidden Leaf? So the reason Minato sealed
the Nine Tails in Naruto, but left a key to unlock the seal…
was for this purpose?! He never did anything that
was unnecessary. So he concluded that
this masked man, Madara, posed an enormous threat to us. And that only the one who controlled
the Nine Tails' power had a chance of defeating him… So he chose Naruto… So Minato entrusted everything
to you? He knew he wasn't the savior? I don't know if Dad
ever considered himself to be a savior or not. But my master told me that
Dad was the Child of Prophecy… the savior. Do you recall what
I told you earlier? That savior, Minato, is dead. Don't you think that was a failure? You're right. My dad died. He died along with my mom,
trying to protect Hidden Leaf Village from the enemy and the Nine Tails! Trying to protect me! It only lasted a moment… But in that moment,
they gave me something. They gave me the belief that I am capable of lots and
lots and lots of things! And they entrusted me to
be the savior of the world! Raikage! If you kill Naruto to try
to stall the enemy, then this time for sure,
the Nine Tails will be taken! And it will definitely spell
the end of the world! Only Naruto can control
the Nine Tails' power. Just as Minato believed! Letting Naruto go is the way to
protect shinobi, and everyone! My bet is on Naruto! So what is your decision?! Let me go too, fool, ya fool! Like you always said,
I'm a big fool too. And Naruto here is just like me…
Don't you agree? But to succeed, you need
fools like us who don't care at all
how big or strong the wall! Yahoo! Bro's at top speed,
you can't go much faster! I think he wants to kill Naruto…
This can become a disaster! As always, you're so stubborn.
I have no choice, but to join in! I can't involve Granny in this! Here I come, Naruto! A lot of people have
put their trust in me. I won't fail! I shoulder many responsibilities too. I won't fail! He dodged it?! Fool, ya fool! He really is… …just like the Yellow Flash! You're right, Raikage… If I fail, I'm not a savior. So I will not fail!
Just like my dad didn't. Just like my savior dad taught me! I just wanted to see for myself… So I came at you,
with intent to kill. You're only the second one
to ever outrun my fastest punch. It seems the savior is alive…
within you. Now go. Right! This is the only way. According to this data, when Naruto is
in Nine Tails' chakra mode, he can sense the enemy's hostility. He'll be able to see through
the white being's Transformation Jutsu. Furthermore, we can deploy
Naruto's shadow clones to each battlefield to counter them. If we delay any longer,
there will be no turning back! The only problem is… This is a war to protect Naruto,
a Jinchuriki. Throwing into him into battle would be like getting
our priorities backwards. In the first place,
Lord Raikage would never allow it. That's true. Well… About that… That doesn't seem
to be the case. The long night is finally
coming to an end. They should be able to
use their eyes now. New Pains of the Six Paths
using Jinchuriki. I've just added a little something… Strafing against the Blunt Blade
Helmet Splitter

 has no effect whatsoever!

 Trying to block me is meaningless!

 This next attack will be your last!

 Not yet! I hope you don't think
this will be over soon.

 There's no way to block
the Blunt Blade Helmet Splitter!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Helmet Splitter: Jinin Akebino!"

 Who said anything about blocking?!

THE HELMET SPLITTER: JININ AKEBINO!

 THE HELMET SPLITTER: JININ AKEBINO!

 Tune in again!

 Captain Kakashi… What's the enemy up to? There are no signs of life,
even the enemy's. It's completely silent. What's going on?
I don't think they would just give up. The key to a shinobi battle is
psychological warfare. I don't like doing what
the enemy wants us to do, but we should use this as
a chance to rest. Everyone, rest up and
recover your chakra! But be on your guard! We'll scout the area
every half an hour! We must make sure we're ready to begin
fighting again at any time! That is all! Guy, you should rest a little too. Did you think that I could sleep
at a time like this?! I understand how you feel, but… Captain Kakashi… We've received that item from HQ. Reanimation…
This jutsu is unforgivable! Sai, use the Foundation's
Sealing Jutsu. Follow my lead! But I still can't use that jutsu… Danzo thought highly of you,
didn't he? There's no need to suppress
your emotions anymore! Hey, Sai, sorry to bother you
while you're resting. That's okay. This just came from headquarters. You need this for
your Sealing Jutsu, right? Lee… Is it the enemy?! It looks like you can still fight. Yes, sir! I, Rock Lee, the Blue Beast, do not know the meaning
of the word "exhaustion"! I want you to be Sai's bodyguard. He won't be able to
defend himself well while he's preparing
his Sealing Jutsu. Leave it to me! I will risk my life for him! I leave it to you, Sai. Y-Yes, sir. Sai! I look forward to working with you! Do not worry! No matter who the foe, I will not let them
lay a finger on you! – Lee…
– Sai! You can skip the formalities
and call me by a nickname like you do with Naruto and Sakura! I'd like you to leave me
alone for a while… I understand! Call me right away
if something happens! Do you have a moment? Sure, what is it? I'd like to hear a little more
about Sai's Sealing Jutsu. Okay. Where should I begin? You know that he used to be
a member of the Foundation, right? It probably all started when Orochimaru attacked
during your Chunin Exams. I need you to learn
this Sealing Jutsu. Yes, sir… The Third Hokage was
an unparalleled jutsu user. But when Orochimaru
used Reanimation to bring back the First
and Second Hokage, he had to seal them away
with the Reaper Death Seal… and in doing so, sacrificed his life. In order for things to
work in our favor, the Foundation needs
a powerful Sealing Jutsu. But will I be able to master
a Sealing Jutsu that will work against someone
as powerful as Orochimaru? You can do it. You've been taught that shinobi
don't need emotions, right? Yes… Your suppressed feelings create
massive amounts of energy deep inside your heart. By releasing that emotional energy, your Sealing Jutsu will
become very powerful. But be careful! Releasing your emotions
can make you susceptible to negative feelings. It can be very dangerous. The Helmet Splitter: Jinin Akebino

 It's time to change shifts. Okay. How are things? There's been no change. It's morning and
they still haven't shown up. It sure is quiet. It's like the calm
before the storm. I hope it means
the festival's over. E-Enemy attack! They're here! This way! He ran away? Damn it! Is he over here?! Hey… Where did everyone go? There he is! This way! Even though he's cornered, he doesn't look like
he's going to fight us. The enemy sent
their weaker forces into battle. It seems like hiding in the trees and using guerrilla warfare
will be their main tactic. They want us to become bold and pursue
our targets, and once we've scattered, they'll destroy
the Shinobi Alliance one by one. I hate to admit it,
but their aim was for us to become overconfident
after defeating Zabuza! What are we going to do?!
Things are going downhill! We need to regroup. Send a message to each team telling them to work with
at least two other teams! Okay, got it! And what will you do? I'm worried about
the squads behind us. If I were the enemy, I would use this confusion to
cut off our support squads! The rear guards are tough and have the restraints and seals
to fight against Reanimation. Well, I don't understand!
I'll just let you handle it! You heard us, right?!
Send a message to all teams! Do not pursue the enemy
if you see them! Try to stick together and
we'll destroy them one by one! Yes, sir! Guy Sensei! Sorry I'm late! Hey! Sai! Lee! Perfect timing. Follow me! We're going to prepare a seal! Yes, sir! You can count on me! We won't let them get their way! Sai, it takes time for you to
prepare the Sealing Jutsu, right? How do you know about that? Actually, I asked Kakashi
whether it takes time for you to concentrate
in order to use emotional energy. I will protect you while
you're doing that! Earth Style!
Rampart of Flowing Soil! Ensui, prepare
the Shadow Paralysis! Got it! I found you… One more time! Defending yourself against
the Blunt Blade Helmet Splitter is meaningless! Form a line of defense… Trying to block me is meaningless. You still don't seem to understand! This next attack will be your last! It's not over yet! That's… Captain Kakashi! I hope you don't think
this will be over soon! Sai, please begin! Okay… Let's see what
your Sealing Jutsu can do! But be careful! Releasing your emotions
can make you susceptible to
negative feelings. It can be very dangerous. I've made up my mind. But I've been told to suppress my emotions
ever since I was little. Is it really possible for me to
master this Sealing Jutsu? More importantly, can I overcome
this sense of fear I have when I release my emotions? You've succumbed to
your negative feelings. You're back… Sir Danzo… What is this? You must assimilate the mass
of negative feelings you have pent up within you
and train carefully. This jutsu is the reason why I raised you all from the time
you were young. Try to gain complete control
over your emotions. Release your negative feelings
and restrain them. I couldn't suppress
my emotions that time… Can I suppress my emotions now
better than I could then? If anything, it's even harder now! But… I have to do this! I see there's still someone who's
a bit of a challenge in this world. Even if you're one of the Seven
Ninja Swords Men of the Mist, we're not going to let you
win so easily. Shut up! That eye looks dangerous, but… If I thrust my sword
towards you, I can win! There's no way to block
my Helmet Splitter. Who said anything about blocking? Your defense is weak! One down! Ensui! Yes, sir! Hold him with Shadow Paralysis
until the seal is ready. Understood. The rest of you, group up with
the squad in front. Follow me! Let's go! Shadow Stitching Jutsu! I see… It's the same kind of hidden
ninjutsu that Shikamaru uses. This is only a stopgap measure. If I undo my seal, he'll be free. I hope you can seal him away
as soon as possible. Impossible… Run away, little brother. Our bodies are indestructible.
There's no way you can win! Shin… Brother, snap out of it! Secret Black Technique!
Salamander! Brother! Sai… I heard it was difficult, but he really looks
like he's suffering. Are you all right? Lee… Someone's coming! An Explosive Style User! This is not good! Sai! Hurry up with the seal! Lee can't handle this by himself. I need to assist him! There's no need to worry! I won't forgive the Akatsuki! They're controlling the dead
using Reanimation. I'm seriously mad. Is there any reason
why I would lose? No! There isn't! How? I don't sense any negative feelings
coming from Lee's anger. Why? Doesn't anger come
from negative feelings? This is bad! How dare you… How dare you harm my friend! The enemy is on the move. We should regroup with
the main company! Sai! If there's anything I can do,
let me know! I'll do whatever I can! I'm your friend, after all! I see… I see… The source of Lee's anger
is his feelings for his friends. But I can't do that… No! I'm different from how I was then.
I have friends now. And now, I have a lot of
feelings towards those friends. A Sealing Jutsu that becomes
more powerful when I release my emotions. But those emotions don't have
to be negative ones that come from anger or sorrow! Sai! Lee… I still haven't given you
a nickname, have I? I'll think of one,
once this war is over. Sai! Do it. Sealing Jutsu… Crouched Tiger Bullet. Okay! We caught him! Return! Whatever the defense… Wait! Don't go after him! Sai! What a pathetic sight, Maki!
You're protecting a Mist shinobi.

 She is my comrade.

 A "comrade"? What are you
talking about?

 She's from the Bloody Mist.
They would even kill their own kind.

 We've formed
the Allied Shinobi Forces!

 An alliance? Whatever!
You idiots!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"User of the Scorch Style:
Pakura of the Sand!"

 You intend to die
protecting an enemy shinobi?

USER OF THE SCORCH STYLE:
PAKURA OF THE SAND

 USER OF THE SCORCH STYLE:
PAKURA OF THE SAND

 Tune in again!

 We've stopped
the Hidden Stone's schemes! Our village is one step closer
to victory. We can all thank this person
for the success of the mission! Pakura of the Scorch Style is
a hero of the Hidden Sand! Sensei! Maki… What is it? Please train me! I just finished a mission. So even you get tired, Sensei? Honestly… A diversion? I was so close! That was good. You would have
caught anyone else. Please let me try it
one more time! Don't get so hasty. I'm sure you'll become stronger. Do you think so? You want to get stronger
to get revenge, right? Yes! I want to avenge my father… He was killed by a shinobi
of the Hidden Mist… Those feelings will
make you stronger! Your feelings for your family, this village,
and your friends in this village… and the desire to defend this village… is what makes a shinobi strong! Yes! Now then… about our negotiations for
a truce with the Hidden Mist… They still seem to hold a deep grudge
toward our village. Although we made a proposal
that is ridiculously against our favor, they refused to budge. But now is the time for a showdown
with the Hidden Stone! We shouldn't worry
about the future! I guess we have no choice. We need Pakura to be useful again…
for the sake of the village. PAKURA

Our hero… Pakura of the Scorch Style
has died. PAKURA

She never gave up
and fought until the end. We shall not let her death
be in vain! She died for the village and
we must carry on her will, and destroy Hidden Stone Village! Pakura Sensei… User of the Scorch Style:
Pakura of the Sand!

 Ninja Art: Needle Senbon! Weaklings! Captain… Wait, don't do anything until
we can get a handle on the situation. Captain Monga! The enemy isn't attacking
in large squads… but they are using
guerrilla tactics. We're facing the Seven Ninja
Swords Men of the Mist. He was mummified! I wonder if she's fighting again too… We don't know where
the enemy will appear! Don't let your guard down! Captain! We should search
for the enemy. Our role is to wrap up the battle. Wait until we receive orders
from the front lines! But there must be something
we can do! Sealing, medical and intel teams
are needed on the battlefield! Our mission is to protect them! We can't put ourselves in
unnecessary danger! That's right. The only people who can
stop the Reanimation are the Sealing Corps. But Ruka,
you and the Medical Corps… Don't worry! As long as I'm here, they won't be able
to lay a finger on you! I'll risk my life for you. Captain… It's all right! If something happens
to the captain, I'll risk my life to save him! I got it, I got it! He's strong even without
a ninja blade! But there's only one of him. If we surround him with more people
and attack in waves… that should create
an opportunity for us… Seems like it's a tough fight. It is him we're fighting… Hey, Maki, why aren't they attacking
with a large squad? I don't know… Anyway, we need to figure out
what the enemy is going to do and put together a strategy. How many enemies are there? I don't know.
They just suddenly appeared. Maki, Ruka! Fall back! Perhaps you should tell them
to run as fast as they can… If they don't, they'll go boom. Gari of the Explosion Style… I never expected to face you… Yeah, you don't have
enough men to take me on. That's exactly what
we want you to think… I get it! The flashy guerrilla tactics are
just to scatter our forces. You were targeting
the support squads in the rear from the beginning, huh? That's the quickest way
to end the battle, isn't it? Besides, I've been brought
back to life and I can't stand being immobile
because of a Sealing Jutsu. I never expected someone
like you to be satisfied with being just a puppet… You've never been dead,
so you wouldn't understand. Death isn't something
to take lightly! Earth Style: Mud Slide! Don't get near him! Sorry, your advice has
fallen on deaf ears… Captain Monga, I… You guys stay there! I can handle this by myself. How fun… But you can't stop me
with just spirit! Can you defend yourself against
Explosion Style with just that? You did it, Captain Monga! Yeah. But… Maki, seal him away right away. Captain! This jutsu is… Pakura Sensei… Pakura Sensei… You're…Maki? I never expected to
see you again, like this. Your face paint hasn't changed. Maki, what do you mean
by "Sensei"? She was once
the Hidden Sand's hero. She is also the person
who trained me to become a shinobi. Coming back to life has
been full of surprises. Why are you fighting, Sensei? Can't you move by
your own free will? It's simple!
To vent my frustration… at being banished to the darkness
of death and being silenced! Vent your frustration? I was made into the village hero. And after all that praise, I was sacrificed as a pawn
for the benefit of the village. This frustration… This anger… The ones who used me
are long gone, but the village that killed me is
a painful reminder that still exists. That's right! I'm fighting to eradicate
the Village Hidden in the Mist! The Village Hidden in the Mist? I heard that you had died fighting
the Hidden Stone. That was a story made up
by our superiors to take advantage of my death. That day, I realized everything
just before I died… The Kazekage ordered me to
the Hidden Mist Village as an envoy. It was a top-secret mission,
so I left in secret. Pakura of the Scorch Style! We've come to welcome you. It is an honor to meet you. This mist shrouds us, so we thought you would need
someone to lead the way. Thank you very much. But there is no way I would
get lost going through this valley. Very true! Well, please proceed. Fine. W-What are you doing?! Feel the pain felt by our comrades
who were killed by your village! Don't get the wrong idea. Don't think that this will
get rid of our grudge. Your sacrifice is
but a small comfort. The ones from the Hidden Sand who handed you over are
probably thinking that. I was used as a bargaining chip
with the Village Hidden in the Mist… to benefit our village. Impossible… How horrible… From what I can see, seems one of them has slipped
into your ranks… A Bloody Mist shinobi, huh? That was all in the past! The Fifth Mizukage has ushered
in a new age for the Hidden Mist! Do you think that erases
your past?! The Hidden Mist's history
of blood and treachery? Please stop, Pakura Sensei! If you want to blame something, blame our village for
betraying your trust! You should blame
the Hidden Sand for casting aside a loyal hero
such as yourself! In all honestly, I'm still confused
by your story. But I strongly believe that
it's wrong to attack people who have nothing to do
with your grudge! They are involved! That's because
you can't see it, Sensei! I've learned something while fighting
in the Allied Shinobi Force. Even people who were once
prejudiced against other villages can work together, talk together, understand each other,
and cooperate! If that's the case… If that's the case…! Who can get rid of this grudge
that festers deep in my heart?! Are you telling me that
it can't be helped, and that I should just give up?! Well… Enough talk!
My body has been reanimated. I cannot go against my orders
to fight the Allied Shinobi Force! You guys run away.
But take this transmitter… Leave this to me! Hidden Cloth Jutsu! That was a good move. I wonder how far
you can run away. We can't fight her normally. We need to regroup with
the rest of the team. I'll try to contact them! You saved us, Ruka. My Water Style is pretty good, huh? Sorry, I'm so useless… So this is where you were. You can't fight me, and it seems you can't run away
from me either. What will you do? Are we going to continue to
play hide-and-seek? Sensei… Just let me say this. You cannot erase the past,
but you can help create the future! I believe that our experiences,
from fighting in the Allied Shinobi Force, will change future relations
between the villages! We'll have a new shinobi world that won't make
the terrible mistakes of the past. So, Pakura Sensei, you died
as a hero of the Hidden Sand… Please remain a hero. This is one flashy fight… Zaji, Omoi! Sorry we're late.
We ran into some trouble. Now! Did we get him? Our enemy has a Kekkei Genkai. If you get hit with that fireball,
it's all over. But we'll cover you! We're counting on you. – Ruka!
– Okay! Gotcha! They multiplied? Don't stop moving! I see you've learned
how to do it, Maki. But I can't let you capture me! Now! Ruka! On my signal,
use maximum water power! Zaji! Come on, Maki! Come at me! Before that, I'll fight you. You're being difficult. Well then,
I'll take care of you first! Ruka! I'm the one who'll get you! We've got her! Explosion Style! Gari of the Explosion Style! This is bad… More people showed up
out of nowhere. You're a mess, Pakura. If I had recovered a little later, it would have been
all over for you. Are these guys that strong? You've gotten strong, Maki… The good thing about this body
is that I can revive quickly. Well, let's continue. I'm going to take out
that pesky sealer first. We're not going to let you. We're going to make sure
you can't revive yourself again. You won't be able to…
Don't regret it in the afterlife. What do you think
you're doing, Pakura? If children don't hurt themselves,
they never learn. So I feel like giving them a chance. I'm giving them a chance
to change the future. I don't understand. Are you feeling sympathy
for your old comrades? I don't care if you take it that way. Run, Maki! While I'm still conscious! I think we should listen
to what she says. It will be difficult to fight
the two of them. Let's go, Maki! Maki… Let's go, Ruka… Pakura of the Scorch Style… I've always wanted to fight you,
at least once. But it seems I'll never
get that chance… Yeah… My consciousness
is being taken away… Maki! You still can't contact
any of the other teams? Please be quiet for a moment! It's hard enough to hear as it is. Huh? Where's Maki? What? She was just here… Tsunade, when was
the first time you decided to

 place all your bets on Naruto?

 Was it when he defeated Pain?

 No, it was long before that…

 Back in those days,
all I could bet on was money…

 And if the money and booze ran out,
I just kept topping it up…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Things You Can't Get Back"

 In this world, there are some things
that you can't get back.

THINGS YOU CAN'T GET BACK

 THINGS YOU CAN'T GET BACK

 Tune in again!

 Naruto, the Hokage's faith in you
is awfully strong. Have you two had this bond
for very long? Yeah, I made Granny a promise… that I won't die until I became
the Hokage. Yo! That's an interesting promise
to keep. The significance is pretty deep. So Granny decided to bet on me! And she gave me
a symbol of my promise! Just as Minato believed! Letting Naruto go is the way
to protect shinobi, and everyone! I will let Naruto pass! So what is your decision?! Tsunade… When was the first time you decided
to place all your bets on Naruto? Was it when he defeated Pain
and became the village hero? No, it was long before that… He… I could give a damn
about being Hokage. No one but a fool would take it on. Anyone who makes fun of
the old man and the Fourth Hokage… It doesn't matter if you are a woman! I'll clobber you with all my might! Damn it! Hey, brat! I'll ask you one thing
before you faint. Why get so passionate at
the mention of Hokage's name? Unlike you, I… will take on the title of Hokage,
no matter what! Because Hokage is my dream! Then how about a bet? A bet…? I'll give you one week. If you can master that jutsu, I'll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage, and give you this necklace. Naruto won the bet. And so, you decided to gamble on him. Yes, that's right. GAMBLE

 GAMBLE

The first time we met… you only placed bets on whether
the dice was odd or even. Oh… All I could bet on
back in those days… was money. Things You Can't Get Back

 Lady Tsunade,
Just a min…! Hurry up, Shizune! The next den… I mean, inn…
won't wait for us. The inn isn't going anywhere. Shinobi? Lady Tsunade, was that…? Don't get involved! Let's go! Th-That's… Bro! Bro! What? What's going on?! Zaji! If it's something stupid,
you're gonna get it. It's not stupid! Over there! – Huh?
– Huh? Look at those… She's…! She's the legendary… Legendary? The legendary… – The legendary…
– The legendary… C'mon… You called us because
you knew, right?! I wanted to liven things up
and make you look good, Bro… You idiot! I'll slam you! But you're smiling, Bro. Of course… After all, she's… – The legendary Sucker!
– The legendary Sucker! And she's got the goods! Change all this into tokens. – Thank you for your patronage!
– Thank you for your patronage! Huh?! Don't mind them. Please have a great time. – Please enjoy yourself!
– Please enjoy yourself! She's already being suckered! No corpse…
It seems the enemy escaped. Damn it! They…got Nigai… It's unfortunate about Nigai… We must hurry and
have Amai take a look. We've arranged to meet
at a nearby inn. I know you're in pain,
but bear with it. I-I'm sorry… I'm sorry. Here I go! All right! Place your bets! – Even!
– Even! – Even!
– Odd! Snake eyes! Even! Odd! – Even!
– Odd! Even! – Thank you very much!
– Thank you very much! What on earth are you doing?! You can't go into debt to
make money anymore! Just go and borrow money again. From where?! There they come. Huh? Is there a woman called
Tsunade staying here? The one with the huge jugs! We're gonna look for her! Hey! What's the big idea?! – We're bill collectors!
– We're bill collectors! We'll go through this joint from
one end to the other! – Right!
– Right! Who are you men? Well… We're really scary vultures
from the Land of Gold. Lassie… Have you seen a lady
who looks like this? She's got a big chest. Oh, that pretty lady is
in another room! – Where?!
– Where?! I'll go and call her! Wait a minute, lassie! What's that shiny thing
in your hand? Huh? Oh, this? The pretty lady in the picture
gave it to me. She told me that she had
a really bad experience, and she went crazy on the mountain. Then a bountiful of this sparkly stuff
started coming out of the rocks. Bountiful?! Uh-huh! Lots and lots and lots… She said there was so much,
she couldn't carry it. So she gave me some too. That thing the brat had
in her hand… That's gold! Gold?! It seems Tsunade struck
a mother lode of gold. Are you serious?! Which means… We'll lose big time if
she pays up her debt now. What do you mean? We have to keep loaning her money,
and rack up interest. There's no doubt we'll get
our money back. So we'll let her keep
borrowing and borrowing! Oh my, if it isn't the bill collectors! I'm sorry you had to come
this far to find me. – Oh no!
– Oh no! No trouble at all. My war chest is full for tomorrow! All right, time to go drinking! That was fraud! I didn't lie. When I split a rock on the mountain,
I did find gold. It's true?! Well, it was one shard. You said the mountain was bountiful! Yeah, I found it on Mt. Bountiful. Really! Lady Tsunade! Tsunade…?! Is that you, Amai? Lord Raikage… Thanks to you distracting
the enemy, my side went without incident. We obtained the Ninja Art Scroll for the Hidden Jutsu unique
to the Cedar Village. However, we cannot return
to the village right away. Karai! Hey…Amai… You idiot! What about Nigai? Nigai… Damn it!
Don't underestimate me! Lightning Rat Tremor! Nigai! Don't come! Please… don't come! Nigai! It's this bug-shaped lump! Inside this lump is a mass of chakra
with Paper Bomb-like properties. The chakra of the possessed
is sucked out and when it exceeds
a certain volume, it explodes. You mentioned that Nigai used
a jutsu at the very end. Using a jutsu involves releasing
a large amount of chakra. That chakra is absorbed, and the lump suddenly
increases in size. Are you saying it exploded?! Can Karai be saved? My Medical Ninjutsu… is not powerful enough… I see. But there is someone
who can save him! What?! And…she's here in this town! Who might this be? Lady Tsunade of
the Hidden Leaf Village! No one in this world can match
Lady Tsunade's skills as a Medical Ninja. Surely, that person… Amai! Your name may mean "sweet,"
but don't get saccharine! But Lady Tsunade can… A shinobi from another village doesn't
merit being addressed as "Lady"! The Hidden Leaf and
we of the Cloud are not allies! As if…she would come to our aid… She will! Rather, I will make her! I will bring Tsunade here,
if I have to drag her! And… No, Lord Raikage… Do not rely on a shinobi from
a rival village just for my sake… I will make her heal you! Will you abandon your pride
as the Raikage?! I will keep my pride!
And I will save you! Lord Raikage… Now you sound
more naïve than Amai. What pride is there is letting
my subordinate die?! How can I call myself the Raikage?! Karai! You do not have
my permission to die! I order you to stay at my side
until we return to the village! Lord Raikage… Let's go, Amai! Take me to Tsunade! Shizune, we're out of sake. Hey! Wake up! Sake! We're out of sake! Sake! Damn it! What a wimp…
Passing out so soon! Sake! Sis! This… Is this…? Yes, this is the necklace that belonged to the First Hokage,
our grandfather. I love you, Sis! I'm gonna be
like Grandfather and take on the title
of Hokage one day. Because becoming
the Hokage is my dream. Just one more time… Just one more glimpse… of that smiling face… I love this village
and my comrades. So I want to protect them. Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me. He is just like me. So I'll become the Hokage. A person that protects everyone. Becoming the Hokage is my dream. I'd like you…to take this. I could give a damn
about being Hokage. No one but a fool would take it on. I just wish he were alive… I truly loved him… That's why… I want to see him
and hold him tight… You are one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Village Hidden in the Leaves… Lady Tsunade, I have sought you out
to make a request! I beseech you…
Please hear me out! Who are you? Yes! I am Amai, a shinobi
of Hidden Cloud Village! Please use your world-renowned
Medical Ninjutsu skills to save my comrade! Are you a Medical Ninja of the Cloud? Yes, ma'am! If your comrade is hurt,
you heal him. The situation is beyond my skills… I don't want to. But…! The Cloud dares to approach one who belongs to
the Hidden Leaf for a favor? You tried to steal
the Hyuga's Byakugan. That was settled between
the two villages. A typical answer from
the one who started it. Please let bygones be bygones. Enough Amai. I never expected her
to listen willingly! May I present the leader
of the Hidden Cloud… Lord Raikage. Well, now… So the big shot's waltzed in. If you refuse,
you will be forced to come. That's interesting. Do you realize who
you're threatening? You're going to regret saying that! I will wait for you in
the clearing in the back. That bitch! Tsunade!
You broke your word to me! You will pay dearly! Wake up! Get up and fight me! Who are you? Lord Raikage of the Cloud. Huh?! Well, isn't this a surprise… You said that yesterday! Don't be angry! I know. Let's make a bet. A bet? You said you'd force me
to come, right? So we'll arm wrestle. If you can beat me, I'll go with you. Uh… What happened while
I was asleep? Ready… Go! She's overpowering me?! This…woman! I cannot lose! If I lose here, Karai will… I… cannot lose! Lady Tsunade, you lost a contest
of physical strength…? No! This guy… He purposely weakened
his hold for an instant to create a space between our grip. And he seized that moment to
push down swiftly against my hand. He didn't beat me with power. He won with speed! I won't let you accuse me
of being cowardly. I'm not going to. We didn't say
this was a contest of strength. You beat me in arm wrestling. Then you'll treat Karai?! We're this way. Let's go, Shizune! Y-Yes! Amazing… Karai! It's Lady Tsunade! We brought the best Medical Ninja
in the world! You're going to be all right! You mentioned that you stole
the Hidden Jutsu of the Land of Cedar. Who would have imagined that the Cedar Village would have
someone so skilled. It wasn't a shinobi who belonged
to Cedar Village. What? It was the Nokizaru Troops
who were hired by the Cedar Village. What?! The Nokizaru Troops? You mean,
the shinobi who hunt shinobi?! I cannot let my treatment
be compromised. Tell me what you know.
Tell me everything! The Explosive Bugs should
be removable through simple surgery.

 I leave Karai in your hands!

 Shizune, do it.

 Why are you having her do it?

 Don't worry about it!

 Shizune is a highly skilled
Medical Ninja!

 But I want you to…

 Silence! I'm going to have
Shizune do this!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"One Worth Betting On"

 You'll be sorry if
anything happens to Karai!

 One Worth Betting On

 As I explained en route,
our mission was to obtain the Hidden Jutsu
from the Cedar Village. Collecting Hidden Jutsu…
What else is new? Go on… After obtaining the Hidden Jutsu,
I left to tend to another matter, so… I'll take over now. Lord Raikage… Leave it… Leave it… What? A smokescreen? Taking us for fools! Leave it… Who are you? Are you from the Cedar Village? We are not shinobi of
the Cedar Village! We have no homeland,
nor a master. People seek us out,
and we fulfill their wishes. The Cedar Village came to us
and their wish is… Death to those who stole
the Hidden Jutsu of the Cedar Village! Mercenary shinobi, eh! Lightning Attack! Karai! Karai, what's wrong?! Why you—! We are the wandering phantoms
of the forest. Nokizaru! Nokizaru…? Shinobi who prey on other shinobi… Nokizaru Troops eh? Lord Raikage! Karai is in no condition to… I'm fine. Let's go! That's it? They're such cowards! Lord Raikage, do not let
the enemy provoke you! There should be someplace
we can go just up ahead. The Raikage of the Cloud
isn't much of anything… What—?! Damn it! Don't underestimate me! Lightning Rat Tremor! Nigai! Don't come! Please… don't come… Nigai! Why you…! You won't get away with this! No, Lord Raikage! Both Nigai and I used our jutsu and that induced an anomaly
within our bodies… If you use your jutsu too… Stay back, Karai! Perhaps they saw I meant business
and were scared off… They did not appear again. But I wonder why? They were the aggressors… Furthermore, Nigai used his jutsu
and it caused him to explode. Karai also used his jutsu. He realized the change
in his body, and quickly suppressed any further
activity to prevent an explosion. But the chakra with Paper Bomb-like
properties that's attached to his chest is absorbing his jutsu's chakra,
and he's in great pain. Lord Raikage manipulated
the most powerful of all the chakra. But he is safe and sound. He's not sound at all. You can't tell by looking
at him now. But I can sense in the Raikage, the same type of chakra
as that lump. What do you mean?
I feel perfectly fine! For now, you are. I'm certain that this lump
is an Exploding Bug that only the Nokizaru Troops
have been successful in propagating. You've seen what it does. Once it finds a host,
it absorbs chakra and grows, and inevitably explodes. The size of the larva merits concern. Huh? You felt it? The larvae are as tiny as cells,
invisible to the human eye. Then… Yes… You fell right into the enemy's trap
on first contact. Larvae scattered into the atmosphere
with that explosion of light… and you kept breathing them in,
unaware of anything. Then why is Lord Raikage…? She's right! Why don't I have a lump? I was in the same situation
as Karai and Nigai! And I can't say
I didn't manipulate chakra! Earlier, when we arm-wrestled,
I used quite a bit of chakra. The unruly Cloud brat
only grew in size. How dare you…! Now, now… Hear me out before
you start yelling. In the first place, we shinobi activate our jutsu
by manipulating chakra. The quantity of chakra depends
on the level of the jutsu. And we adjust the amount
with each jutsu we use. The stronger the jutsu,
the more chakra we require. Hence, we store chakra in our bodies
for fixed periods of time. Just a minute… Earlier, you mentioned an arm-wrestling
match between the two of you. Don't you use chakra when
you use physical strength? Yes… However, the Raikage
did not use chakra for strength. To counter my physical power… he used speed to push me back. Naturally, one uses chakra
to release speed too. Reducing chakra into speed
requires instant consumption… Not nearly enough time for
the Exploding Bug to steal the chakra. So I am going to end up like Karai? Exactly! One uses a little chakra even
for normal daily activities. So until the insect is removed,
you must remain sedentary. Then it can be removed? Yes. Simple surgery should remove it. Shizune, get ready to operate! Yes! And… Oh, please wait! I will assist! Thank you. What is it? Huh? Oh, we'll operate on
your subordinate first since he faces risk of exploding
at any moment. That's fine. I want you to save Karai. No, please wait! You must let Lord Raikage go first! Impossible! I said the surgery itself is simple. However, if the Exploding Bug
has attached itself intricately to the Chakra Network, it will require considerable
medical skill and experience. Furthermore, it could explode
at any time, and the surgeon must take
the risk of dying too! So I'm not going to listen
to your nonsense! All right, Tsunade.
I'm fine with that. Tend to Karai first. Oh, sorry… I got carried away. But there's one more reason
why your surgery is not possible yet. The Exploding Bug in
your system is too small for the human eye to see. Until it grows larger,
there's nothing we can do. Yet, you can't just sit back and wait. We don't know
how much chakra it takes for the Exploding Bug to grow
into a lump and explode! So, give me your word, Raikage! That you will allow us to proceed
with the surgery in our own way! That you will not move at all. All right, I give you my word! Looks like you'll keep your word. What is it? Just a bug. What's wrong? Nah, it's nothing. Anyway, our target is definitely
inside that abandoned building. And how is the Raikage? No change. Are you sure he inhaled
the Exploding Bug? No doubt about it. The timing and distance
were spot on. Then why? Why isn't the Exploding Bug
maturing? If I knew that, we wouldn't
be here spying on them. Let's just attack them. Waiting like this is boring. Don't be stupid. One of them could explode
at any time. If we go in now,
we might end up dead too. Don't forget our goal. We were hired to get
the scroll back, intact. The easiest way is
to negotiate a trade. We remove the Exploding Bug
in exchange for the scroll. It doesn't matter
if the enemy lives or dies, but we must retrieve
the scroll undamaged! Then we'll be rewarded in full. It looks like others have come
to aid the enemy. So as a precaution, we'll scatter some more
Exploding Bugs again… when everyone is gathered
in one location. I brought the antiseptic. Thank you. May I assist? I'd like to learn
for future reference… I'd appreciate that. By the way, are you able to
perform hemostatic jutsu? Oh yes, you can count on me. That will be very helpful. Please go over to that side
and help me. This will save so much time, instead of controlling the bleeding
and doing the excision by myself. Thanks…Amai. Don't you worry. Lady Tsunade will get every
little bug out. We're going to start
the anesthesia, so please relax. Are you ready to begin the surgery? Yes, we just gave him
the anesthetic. It will take effect
in a minute or two. All right, Tsunade!
Take care of Karai! Shizune, do it. What? Why aren't you
taking up the scalpel? I thought you were… Silence! I'm going to
have Shizune do this! Don't tell me to shut up! I recognized the fact that you are the best Medical Ninja
around, that's why… Don't worry about it! Shizune is a highly skilled
Medical Ninja! Besides, you gave me your word… That you would allow us to proceed
with the surgery in our own way! You're right, I did. But you'll be sorry
if anything happens to Karai! Don't worry,
I'll step in if I have to. Why don't you go downstairs
and take a nap? How are we, Shizune? Okay! We're ready anytime! Fine, go ahead and begin. All right. We will now begin
the procedure to open up the chest cavity
and remove the Exploding Bug. Please begin your hemostatic jutsu. Right! What's the matter? It's all right. The Exploding Bug got big
for just a second. My god! How am I supposed to
keep my word to stay still? What's wrong, Tsunade? What's wrong, Tsunade? Blood? I see… Hemophobia…
So you're afraid of blood! So that's why you left the surgery
up to your subordinate… Excuse me… I'm going outside
to get some air. What a debilitating condition for
a Medical Ninja to be plagued with… Nawaki… Dan… Hey, Shizune… Tell me something. I'm in the middle of surgery. I know that. I'm not asking you to stop. Tsunade is right up there
with Jiraiya and Orochimaru, as one of the Legendary Sannin
of the Hidden Leaf. What on earth happened
that made her fear blood? I'm curious too… Even though Lady Tsunade
is not from our village, she exemplifies what
we Medical Ninja strive to become. But what I observed earlier… I understand. Lady Tsunade had
two great loves in her life. One was her younger brother,
Nawaki. But on the day after his birthday, after she had just
given him a present… he was killed in battle during
the Third Great Ninja World War. The other person
was the man she had promised to share her life with… Dan Kato, my uncle. I…don't want to die yet. I have so many things left to do… Don't speak! I…can't die…here… Don't worry,
I stopped the bleeding. You're going to be all right. You'll be okay, Dan! Good… I'm so glad… Damn it… Don't bleed out! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I said stop! Ever since that day, Lady Tsunade
has been traumatized. I, too, must have been in shock after watching Nigai die
before my very eyes. Otherwise, I would never
have gambled our lives on the hands of a Medical Ninja
who has lost it. Lady Tsunade hasn't lost it! The removal of
the Exploding Bug is complete. This surgery is over! Please close him up! Yes! One more thing… Lady Tsunade's Medical Ninjutsu
is not lost. I will carry on for her. And Lady Tsunade will
get back on her feet. She must! For my late uncle's sake too! I won the bet, after all. Huh? The reinforcements Arai called,
rushed over and the Nokizaru Troop
seemed to have given up. It was just luck. Hmm? Well then, what is the connection between overcoming your hemophobia and Naruto winning the bet
he made with you? That's… Don't die… Don't die…
Don't die… Don't die! Don't die! Naruto's tenacious life force and… Becoming the Hokage… – Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
– Becoming the Hokage is my dream. That passionate will
to become the Hokage… Once more… Just one last time… I just felt like betting
on Naruto again. Are you telling me I went along
with a silly bet with no odds? It's too late to complain. Why don't you just suck it up? Don't be ridiculous! I've been prepared… ever since the Allied Shinobi Force
was formed. Oh, that's true. The First Hokage's pendant.
Now that I want to see. C'mon and show it to me. I don't have it anymore. I think when the Nine Tails
got called out… I ended up destroying it. Hey, hey…
Wasn't it something important? It's okay. Granny and me… we keep that promise deep down
in our hearts. Yo! Let's hurry! I'll bet everyone's waiting! You revel in killing.

 I hate to think that
we're both called shinobi…

 How arrogant…

 Who gave you permission to
wield the Executioner's Blade?

 That blade belongs to the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist!

 An outsider wielding it
is impossible!

 I don't like it one bit.

 Going up against these two alone
is going to be rough, but…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Danger: Jinpachi and Kushimaru!"

 Looks like you're backed up
against a wall, buddy!

DANGER: JINPACHI AND KUSHIMARU

 DANGER: JINPACHI AND KUSHIMARU

 Tune in again!

 Sai of the Hidden Leaf sealed away
one of the Ninja Swords! Looks like you did well, Sai. I just hope we can
keep morale high. We've received
the information we wanted on the Ninja Swordsmen from HQ. We should gather as much
information as we can while the enemy's stopped
all movement. I should have expected it.
They're all quite fearsome. We need to be especially
careful of these two. We'll be at a disadvantage
in a group battle. Help me! What's wrong? Strings are controlling my body… Strings?! He's crucifying them alive and
taking pleasure in their suffering… Stop! Stop! Is this some kind of game for you? Ran! You are unforgivable! I feel sorry for the legends
of past generations who are being forced to fight
against their will. It pains me…
You revel in killing. I hate to think that
we're both called shinobi… Stop being so full of yourself. Who do you think
you're pointing that at?! That belongs to the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist! An outsider wielding
the Executioner's Blade? I don't like it one bit! He's mine! Even though they can't die, they don't take each other
into consideration when they make
their brutal attacks… I'm going to kill you and take back
the Executioner's Blade! No, I will. I'll kill you if you get in my way! I'm already dead. Going up against these two alone
is going to be rough, but… Looks like you're backed up
against a wall, buddy! Severe… Leaf Hurricanes! I'm Might Guy,
the Hidden Leaf's Noble Blue Beast! Sorry I'm late, Kakashi. Danger:
Jinpachi and Kushimaru

 Thanks, Guy. You're the one who wanted us
to regroup because it was dangerous
to work in platoons. So why are you doing this
by yourself? Furthermore, you're fighting two of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist. I wanted to save as many people
as I could and got in over my head. I figured that was the case. Anyway, we should get her away
from here while we can. Yeah, thanks. It's kind of creepy to see you
being so grateful. But…I guess your opponents were
just strong enough to make you feel that way. Where am I? He… He killed my comrades! I know. We're going to defeat
the enemy, so you go regroup with
the main regiment. B-But… When we fight them,
you'll only get in our way. Be careful. Now then… How dare you treat our comrades
like they were your toys. Be careful, Guy. Kushimaru Kuriarare, who wields
the Long Blade the Sewing Needle… And Jinpachi Nanashi, who wields
the Explosive Blade, the Splatter… One killed his master and
the other killed his older brother. Aside from that, they've committed
countless acts of cruelty. If you get in my way,
I'll kill you too! I guess you could call them
the cold-blooded combo. We've got to stay focused! That's no problem! They may be the cold-blooded combo,
but we're the comrades combo! No one is a match for the Hidden Leaf's
invincible comrades combo! They're open to attack. They've underestimated my speed. His swings are big because
of that gimmick. But… He doesn't have his Long Blade! Be careful, Guy! Ninja Art Long Blade!
Stitching Spider! This thing! Explosive Blade Jutsu!
Multiple Explosions of Death! Guy! Don't mind me! Get out of here! You saved me again, Kakashi. Earth Style! Multi Mud Wall! I was naïve. I thought I had all the data on the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist… But I never expected them to take
advantage of being reanimated that well. Kakashi? Did they… Yeah… They got my eye. I think it's temporary,
but this is bad. Our enemy is the reanimated
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and we're in terrible shape… This is really bad. Guy! I've survived many
tough situations like this. There's something
I remember every time… Three kunai knives and
one paper bomb… This is all we have… The Stone's best men have us
completely surrounded outside. Yeah… They're going to attack us
first thing in the morning. There's no need to worry! I have my fists. It doesn't matter
if we're short on ninja tools. Let's break through
the enemy lines. Your overconfidence is what got us
stuck here in the first place. Don't you get it? Don't do anything on your own. Why are you being such a bore?! Our next rival challenge is whether I can break through
the enemy lines. Shinobi who defy orders are scum! I'm your captain, and if you
can't follow my orders, leave. I…just don't want that to
ever happen again. Kakashi, you… That's right. Follow me. I'll be a decoy. If the enemy is drawn to me, you'll have a greater chance
of escaping. I'm Might Guy, the Noble Blue Beast
of the Hidden Leaf! I don't die easily! What?! I'm not done yet! Not yet! I need to buy time until dawn! Sorry, Kakashi… As you said, I'm probably not
suited to being a shinobi… Kakashi?! We'll talk later! Let's get out of here! We're all out of chakra. We can't use
any big techniques anymore. Kakashi… Why did you come? Because you defied my orders. I'm not worthy of being
a shinobi, am I? No… In the Shinobi World,
orders are absolute… But if you defied orders to save
the life of your friends… And if I couldn't tell the difference
between the two, I'd be a failure as a captain. You… Besides, I think your plan
could have gone really well. We've been able to draw
the enemy away like now. Rin should have regrouped with
the main squad by now. All that's left is… I have to take care of him… This is bad! Guy! Stone Shinobi… They use jutsu formulas
that cover a wide area. D-Didn't you run out of chakra? Chidori! He cut through a lightning bolt
with Chidori? I thought he was out of chakra! Are you all right, Kakashi? How strange… I thought I was out of chakra… But when I thought about
saving my friends, it came out of nowhere. You should rest, Kakashi. I'll handle the rest. But you can't run on those legs… If I can't use my legs,
I'll use my arms. If I can't use that,
I'll use my fingers or my mouth… and struggle all the way until
the end to save my friends. Just like you did now… Friend, huh? You can't see.
Don't push yourself, Kakashi. If I can't see,
I'll sense things by sound. If I can't do that,
I'll use smell or even my skin… and struggle all the way
until the end to save my friends. You remember that time too…
Let's go! Yeah! C'mon! Let's do this! Don't underestimate me! It seems like repeating
our rival challenge wasn't a waste of time, after all. Even if I can't see you,
I know exactly where you are! By matching your movements… I can even tell where the enemy is.
It's as if I can see. You're in the way! You should disappear! I'll deal with you first! You don't think of your comrades
as comrades… You were never a match for us! Shut up! Substitution Jutsu? You idiot! I can't dodge it! Did we succeed? Damn it… I'm done with this stupid fight! Get back, Kakashi! I'll use my Explosion Blade
to blow up this whole area. We may be immortal,
but if you do that we'll die! We won't know until we try! Shadow Stitching Jutsu! I-I can't move! Captain Kakashi! I've brought the Sealing Team! You can see again, Kakashi? Yeah… Seal these two away. Yes, sir! I knew that you two
would get revenge! W-Withdraw! You made it just in time,
Guy and Kakashi! When a shinobi uses his powers
for his friends rather than himself, his power multiplies. That's what I learned back then. Even I can produce
unfathomable power for my friends… It's strange. Yeah… That's right. I think everyone is feeling
that way in this war. Come on,
let's go look for the other platoons. Yeah. Please help, everyone! – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! Ameyuri Ringo…

 One of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of the Mist.

 Wielder of the Lightning Blade,
the Fang.

 What sort of person is
this Ameyuri?

 Stop hiding!

 Isn't there anyone here that can
send shockwaves through my heart?

 Oh wait…there is someone here
who'll come at me!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Lightning Blade: Ameyuri Ringo!"

 I'm never going to let you go.

THE LIGHTNING BLADE:
AMEYURI RINGO

 THE LIGHTNING BLADE:
AMEYURI RINGO

 Tune in again!

 There's no sign of the enemy. I don't see our forces either. We're too scattered. We must gather the troops together. You're right. Captain Kakashi! Yurui's unit is requesting
reinforcements! Omoi's in that unit.
What's up? They're engaged in a fight
with Ameyuri Ringo! Ameyuri Ringo… One of the Seven
Ninja Swordsmen who wields
the Lightning Blade, Fang… I'll go! I'm going too. Ameyuri Ringo uses
the Lightning Style. I may be able to neutralize her
with my own Lightning Style. The Lightning Blade:
Ameyuri Ringo!

 Stop hiding! Isn't there anyone here that can send
shockwaves through my heart? Lightning Style: Lighting Fang! Cowards aren't my type! Where are the reinforcements?! As punishment…
I'm going to burn you to a crisp! Lighting Style: Thunder Gate! Yurui! Hang on, Yurui! It's over…
Everything's…going dark… Don't give up, Yurui! Help is on the way! Nurui… It's in…
your hands now… Yurui! Yurui! Damn it! I've had it with this! How many have died already? Is this what war is?! Are we the only survivors? It looks that way. I'll take command from now on. I have seniority here. Ameyuri Ringo went after
the other platoon in the other direction. But she'll be back. We have to decide
what to do quickly. It's obvious. We retreat. Are we running away? Just because she's one of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen? Are you suggesting we take on
Ameyuri Ringo? Well… That's not like you, Omoi. I thought you were
the cautious type, just like me. War is not the place
for revenge. And besides,
we don't have a chance against someone with
a Ninja Blade. They are like elephants and tigers.
We're mere ants. Then why the hell are we here?! Don't get full of yourself, Omoi. Are you trying to be a hero now? In any case, I'm the leader now! We'll create a diversion for
Ameyuri Ringo and make our escape. How boring… Not a single soul
to give me a thrill. Oh, that's right. There were two or three
more back there. Maybe they're more my type. That flash of lightning earlier… There's no doubt it was
Ameyuri Ringo's Lightning Style. Damage of this scope,
in an instant. Not even a hundred chunin
could defeat her. Well, who knows… In a desperate moment like this, a hero could rise up
from among them. Wishing for the survival of
our scattered comrades is one thing. Hoping for a hero is
just wishful thinking. Whatever the case,
judging from the traces of battle, Ameyuri Ringo is headed north. There should be survivors
beyond that. Let's hurry! Damn it… If we keep running
and running… Pretty soon,
we'll circle the globe. And if we keep circling
the globe over and over again, we'll forget why the hell
we're fighting. And no one will think
that I'm still alive. I'll keep running and
running until I die. If that's the case, then… Captain! Are we still gonna
keep running away? If we keep running,
maybe the reinforcements will arrive and take care of that bitch. Waiting for others to bail us out?! What are you doing? We have to make it look
like we put up a fight… Otherwise, who knows what
they'll say after the war. How stupid. Talk about ego… And this trap is so obvious! It's like telling the enemy exactly
which way we're running. Nothing good's gonna come
from following this guy! You can't run away from me. They call this a trap? They must think I'm stupid. I'm never going to let you go! Just who is
this Ameyuri Ringo anyway? A woman known to be an exceptional user
of the Lightning Style. Although she died young
from an incurable disease, it's said she never lost her prey. There's no escaping her? That's enough, Kayui! Nurui! You knew this, and still… Here she comes! Damn it!
She's faster than I thought. Of course, she's gonna catch up!
This is such a lame strategy! We can't outrun her! Let's fight! No! It's no use! How far can we run?! She always gets her prey, right?! I know! Well, do you know that our lives
are in your hands?! That's why we're retreating! How can you call yourself
a shinobi?! Have you even thought about
our fallen comrades?! Omoi! You don't understand Nurui! And Nurui, you too! Why don't…?! Shut up, Kayui! I've… had enough of running! Omoi… I know…about your reputation
in the village, Nurui. Omoi! That's enough! That you being cautious is
just to hide your cowardice! Well, I'm a cautious guy,
but I'm no coward! Stop it, Omoi! Fighting is useless right now! We can't be heroes! The thought didn't even
cross my mind! I just keep seeing Yurui's face
as he was dying! And even if we escape somehow, I can't go on living with
that image constantly flashing
through my mind. Stop it, Omoi! Fighting is useless right now! We can't be heroes! The thought didn't even
cross my mind! I just keep seeing Yurui's face
as he was dying! And even if we escape somehow, I can't go on living with
that image constantly flashing
through my mind. Omoi! Looks like Ameyuri Ringo is
still in pursuit of someone. This isn't good… There aren't any Allied Shinobi
units beyond this point. The pursued are only making
themselves more isolated. Let's hurry! Oh, here's one. Someone who's willing to face me! I'm avenging Yurui! What? Running away so soon? You were so worthless after—! Fooled ya! Cloud Style: Deception Slice! No one tricks me! Lightning Blade Jutsu!
Thunderbolt! She's strong…
If I'm gonna beat her, I have to use the one
Bee taught me! My sword technique is
one to behold! If you get 10,000 tickets sold, and if you come and watch me rap
I'll help put your skill on the map. You'll really teach me
your lethal blade technique? Hey, are there really 10,000 guys
in the Hidden Cloud? To put it bluntly,
your sword power and skill ain't too much of a thrill. Unlike my rapping
which keeps feet a-stomping. In other words, you are saying
I'm average? Except your Deception Slice
which is divine. So polish that up and you'll be fine. Now this lesson is at
the end of the line. So you're telling me to tweak
my Deception Slice and make it better? Yeah! And the result of that is… Hidden Mist Slice. Still not giving up? At least you have some backbone. This sword style makes it difficult
to read the path of the blade! I'm just beginning to
execute this jutsu! My personal style…
Hidden Mist Slice, Kai! Let's see you counter this! Huh? They're all decoys?! Gotcha! Lightning Style! Depth Charge! You're not bad at all. Most guys would be dead. Sorry, but I'm really strong. Omoi! I won't kill you just yet. Because I'm the type of person who saves the things
I like to eat for last. Don't come! Nurui! Kayui! Nurui… Nurui! Are you all right, Nurui?! Did you have to act so foolishly? I'm sorry… For my sake… Damn right. Everything's ruined. Now listen carefully… Omoi… Found you! I won't let you get away. It's no good…
I don't feel like I can win! More like, I can't beat her! Are you all right, Kayui?! Yes… Is there anyone else with you? Nurui and Omoi are up ahead… Ameyuri Ringo is there too, huh? And they're going to
bring her down. Nurui was right. Running away was my only option! I'm no hero! How could I have been so stupid?! Now then, are you prepared? Fine… You want me to fight?
I'll fight then. You're determined.
I'll give you that. Please let us get there in time! I have to, I mean,
we have to bring her down. Nurui… Yurui… Bring me down? Are you still talking nonsense? I planned to lick you
from the beginning! 'Cuz my flavor today is apple candy
and your name means just that! Bring it on with
your strongest jutsu! Too bad!
And you were my type too. Lightning Style: Thunder Gate! What is this?! You trapped me?! This is actually a bottomless marsh. Once you're stuck,
you'll never get out. And you're coming with me? What a gentleman! Yurui was my friend. I'm the one who let
personal feelings interfere. I wanted to avenge Yurui… There was only one way
for us to beat her. There is a bottomless marsh
up ahead. It's been covered with
an Earth Style lid. If she uses her Lightning Style there, she'll sink into
this bottomless marsh. I planned to lure her there. Yurui, Kayui and I had made
a number of traps in preparation for a big battle. So you…weren't running away? Omoi, I know the limits
of my strength. But my plan won't work.
You must run away. I'll stop Ameyuri Ringo here. You can't in your condition! And besides, there's no
running away from her, right?! Stop… Omoi… Omoi! Kakashi! Guy! We made it in time. Pull him out. Weren't you going to
come with me? Sorry, maybe another time. In my next life, I'll remember
to eat what I like first. You won't be
reincarnated anymore. Here's a farewell gift from me… Thank you. Omoi… My name's Omoi. Omoi… That's a thank-you gift
from me. I'll be waiting for you
on the other side. You did well, Omoi.
You're a hero. The real hero…is you. So there are new heroes,
after all. It's always a heartwarming sight… This deep bond between men. Kakashi, Guy…
Listen up. I wanted to give you
advance notice. Naruto and Bee are heading
to the battlefront. It seems nothing worked
to convince Naruto. So, we're going to use
this opportunity to turn this war around! Over and out! Did you hear that, Kakashi? Yeah… They're finally on the move. The heroes we've waited
so long for. Since days long past,

 that location has been
a site reserved for sacred use.

 And it's been referred to
as "The Hole."

 The villagers charged with taking care
of the site have been slaughtered.

 – What?
– That's so…!

 Locate the perpetrator

 and mete out
the appropriate punishment!

 – All right!
– Yes, ma'am!

 Next Time on                                              
Naruto Shippuden: "Power - Episode 1" It's been a while, Naruto…

 Tune in again!

He was formidable. I'd expect no less of
my imposter. I did it... Yes! Everyone!
Have things been settled? <i>Yes, Guy Sensei!</i> <i>- Yeah...
- Naturally!</i> All right! Now we head off to
back up Team Kakashi! - Roger!
- Roger! Granny Chiyo! <i>Granny Chiyo...</i> <i>I'm not surprised...</i> <i>Sasori's poison could knock her out
at any moment...</i> <i>We've finished what
we were supposed to do.</i> <i>We need to return to the village
and neutralize the poison immediately...</i> <i>More importantly, I've still got...</i> <i>something I must...do.</i> <i>It's probably...that powerful will
that's keeping her conscious...</i> <i>But...what is it she has
to go this far to do?</i> I'm sorry... Here we go! They're following me. <i>Shall we do this?</i> Naruto. Get back...a little. Got it. Mangekyo Sharingan! <i>Kakashi Enlightened!


</i> Mangekyo Sharingan! What is...this?! <i>A Vision Jutsu...?!</i> <i>Oh no!</i> <i>What is this Jutsu...?</i> <i>It's amazing...</i> You won't get away! Damn it! <i>Damn it...!</i> <i>My arm's getting sucked into space...?!</i> <i>What kind of Jutsu is this?!</i> <i>I missed...</i> <i>I guess I still can't control
the location or size</i> <i>of the dimensional barrier very well...</i> <i>But I won't...miss next time...</i> Damn it! I let him get away! I shook him off, huh? Rasengan! All right! Shadow Clone Jutsu. Gaara! Gaara! Gaara! Kakashi Sensei, you all right? Yeah... somehow... Gaara. I'll get you out now. Gaara! It looks like they came through here. Yes. They were probably going after
Gaara who was taken... You jerk...! Hey! Gaara! Are you listening?! Knock it off! That's enough, Naruto! You should know... That's right. You know, don't you? He's been dead for a while. Please hurry. Right! Please let me know if
it gets too painful. I will... Lee...! I'll leave you behind if
you drag your feet, Tenten! What're you talking about?! I was waiting for you guys to catch up! I see. Naruto and the others
should be expecting us to rendezvous with them. So let's hurry! What? We should wait
for Guy Sensei and Neji... We don't need to worry about that. Huh?! You're late, Lee, Tenten! Oh! It's your fault
they got ahead of us, Tenten! Hey! Hold it, Lee! Kakashi! Can you hear me?
Hey, Kakashi! Just as I thought.
The radio isn't working. Neji, what's happening with Kakashi
and the others? It looks like they're still fighting
the one from the Akatsuki... But it seems they've succeeded
in retrieving the Kazekage... However... However?! <i>Gaara...</i> Gaara! Hey... Hey, Gaara! Gaara! <i>I told you, didn't I?
He's already dead.</i> <i>It was fine using the Kazekage
as bait to lure out the Jinchuriki.</i> <i>But I didn't plan on...</i> <i>him coming along...</i> <i>My left arm...</i> <i>Sand Prison!</i> <i>was crushed by the Sand Jinchuriki,
and even my right arm, too...</i> <i>Now I can't even use a Jutsu.</i> <i>I guess this is it...</i> <i>But...I never thought there was anyone
with Visual Jutsu as good as Itachi.</i> <i>This Jinchuriki's nothing special.</i> <i>Kakashi's the more important issue...</i> I'll pound you! Fine, fine. I'll take you on again one of these days. You let your guard down... Oh no! Yes! I told you that you let your guard down... Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto... It's clay... Was it a Substitution?! <i>That's...!</i> Get a handkerchief ready. The next episode features
a raging conclusion that will leave you in tears. I show great concern for
my foolish pupil from afar. My finally-honed foresight will save
Naruto with the power of love! Oh, I'm involved in this too, <i>so make it the love of
his two  masters that saves him.</i> Then how about,
"Love Saves the Foolish Pupil," for the title of
the next episode? Excellent, Master Jiraiya.
Let's go with that. You're okay with this,
right, Naruto? Next time:
"Aesthetics of an Instant" All right! I haven't been
on a mission in ages! Pipe down, Naruto! It's not something
to rejoice over. Huh? There's been an incident
in the small village of a small nation bordering
the Land of Fire. The inhabitants there
were slaughtered. – Huh?!
– Are you serious?! Since days long past, that location has been a site
reserved for sacred use. And it's been referred to
as "The Hole." There were rumors of it
having hidden treasure and it seems there were
defense measures in place to guard the area from bandits. But total annihilation? I wish I could assign you
more people, but we have serious issues
to deal with in our village too. Are you referring to
the grave-robbing incident at the cemetery outside the village? Yes. Also the attack in the forest where
the Akatsuki is sealed away… Where the sickle was stolen? Things will become much
more hectic for us, but we cannot ignore anything
inflicted upon the general public. Apprehend the ones responsible
for attacking the village, and punish them. I'm counting on you. – Yes, ma'am!
– Yes, ma'am! All right! Everything's burned to the ground… What kind of weapons
did the assailants use? What an amazing forest! But just a bit beyond this
is barren land… Could this be
a treasure storehouse? Let's find out. Oh… Spring water is being
pumped somewhere. A space like this…
exists underground? It's huge. What a strange room… There's nothing in here. Could it have been robbers? Looks that way… Don't move! Are you trying to exploit
the current situation and rob us? No. We're here on request
by your government. We are Hidden Leaf shinobi. We are here to investigate. I beg your pardon.
We are aware of that request. And who are you? We are a security unit from
the neighboring town of Hachou. Tonika Village and our town
have a pact of friendship. I see. Please come this way. There is someone
I'd like you to meet. Shiseru… Who are they? I see. I appreciate your quick response. I am Disonasu,
the head of Hachou Village. Yesterday, a few who
escaped death came to the village seeking help,
and the situation came to light. Do you have any idea
who the assailants were? No… I believe bandits have attacked
on a number of occasions, lured by rumors of treasure. This treasure? Do you know
what it's supposed to be? No… I think only a few
in the village knew. So I guess someone
was attacked by something… Man, this water tastes great! Oh, you… It is pretty though… Inside this "Hole"… It's like it sucked up the life and
energy of everything around it… It's just exploding with vitality. You are absolutely right… This water overflows with life. When did you appear? It's been a long time, you two. Kabuto! Why you…! As always, you love getting
into fights, don't you? What are you doing here? Oh, this and that… Right now…
I'm conducting some research. What the hell is that? I created these snakes using
Lord Orochimaru's cells. Their regenerative power
is so strong. They can multiply in no time. And…thanks to the success
of my experiments, I'm able to implant the nucleus
of other living things and regenerate genetic data. Conveniently, this water seems
to accelerate cell division at an extremely high rate. It's almost like a virus. And then…birth… A new…life. It can't be, it's the Akatsuki's… Yes… Hidan. I guess you're not here
by coincidence. Are you the one who attacked
the village? But since you are here,
you can tell us what happened. You think you can capture me? We won't let you get away. I wonder about that. This isn't my only pawn. Nagato?! Itachi?! They're…members of the Akatsuki! Asuma Sensei and…
Hayate Sensei?! Not…Reanimation?! You bastard! You robbed their graves! That's…? SICKLE I'm going to enjoy this. Quit…screwing around! Naruto! Captain! Why aren't they moving? Is the jutsu still… not complete?! Captain, don't let that guy get
a hold of any of your blood! I know that! I'm sorry…Sensei! Shiseru! I can't hold my breath any longer… POWER



I can't hold my breath any longer… POWER



 Mina, you really like
that melody, don't you? Did you compose it yourself? I hear it. Hear it? Hey, you're pretty weird. Is this supposed to be Sensei? That doesn't look like Sensei! I'm not done yet! – Give it back.
– Here, here! – Come and get it!
– Brother! – Give it back!
– Here, here! Leo… Dokku Sensei, eh? Is he doing well? Uh-huh. He's like this. He's gotten bigger? But he's cute as a teddy bear. Huh? Nice and soft! More like big and fat. Do you like him? Yup! A lot! I see! It seems he's more suited to
this than being a guard. Get inside and hide! Where's Grandpa? No…! I don't wanna die! Help… Someone, please help! Help! Leo? Leo! Leo! Dokku Sensei! Leo! – Sensei…
– Minna! Jump! I'll catch you. Come on, hurry! Don't wanna… Mina, you have to hurry! I'm scared! Don't you like me, Mina? Can you trust me? Uh-huh. Then, be brave! You did good!
That was amazing. Okay, now you, Leo! Don't go… There might still be people in
the village that need my help! Mina, don't you want to see
Yoshi and Satchi? Listen to me. If I don't come back,
you must go to Hachou Town. Got that? When you get to town, go to the town hall and get help. You can do it, right? – Uh-huh!
– Uh-huh! Okay… Okay then… Be brave! The master of the Great Lake once
created "Ama no Goko,"

 but its power was
taken away by evil…

 and it almost destroyed the world.

 Power… So that's what
Kabuto is after.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Power - Episode 2" If I only had more power…more! Tune in again!

 Power I guess that's the limit. That hole from earlier…? That man… is a village guard! Let's meet again. He escaped… Mr. Yamato… Who is he? I'll explain. We're going to need reinforcements. I got a bite! Got it! Here… This one's on me! Thank you, mister. You're from Tonika Village,
aren't you? Huh? You know, the guard. Oh… Well, yes… But I was fired. You seem to be badly wounded. What happened? Oh, just an accident. We've got cheap prices!
This just came in! Stop by! Sensei! Whoa! I'm sorry! I did it! Look how many! Wow! Gotta hand it to my skill! But I chose the bait. You didn't catch a single fish
until you changed bait! Fish, eh? I don't care for fish. Faz, don't be so picky. They're a pain to eat. I don't like things that smell fishy. Mom would make
something different… Your mom is gone! You used to hum
that tune in class too. She says she can
hear something. Hear? Even now? Do you know the survivor
from the village, Shiseru? Yes, he and I were
childhood friends. We lived together as kids. I used to called him, "Brother." I still do. I hadn't seen him at all lately. He put on a lot of weight. But I'm relieved that
he's still his old self. He protected five kids! That's amazing. What's the matter with you? I feel so bloated. Can you wait here? I'll see if he's around. Run away! Huh? What is it? Brother? Sensei! Why're we running away? The symbol on the headbands
of those shinobi… The ones who attacked
the village wore the same mark! Hold it. Please wait.
We mean no harm… DANGER!
DO NOT CROSS Leo, don't!
It's dangerous! But we have to get away! C'mon, Sensei! Mina… Let's go! Sensei! – Sensei!
– What'll we do?! Naruto! Right! I'm sorry… What's happening? Brother?! You're heavy! I'm sorry, I overreacted. The children did it for my sake… I'm sorry. Yeah… You know Shiseru. I'm Dokku. I was their teacher
in the village. This is Leo. Hi! You're gutsy. You could say that! Lando and Faz. Hi. Hello… She's Sora. Hello. Nice to meet you. And…Leo's younger sister, Mina. Huh? Isn't that vest kind of big? Oh, that's mine. But she likes it and refuses
to part with it, so… Oh… Well, nice to meet you. Huh? Oh, sorry… What's wrong, Mina? Hidden treasure? But why would Kabuto want
something like that? It's not like him. Just what was there anyway? I used to be a scholar and conducted
archeological research. In particular, I studied quite
a bit about "the Hole." These are the results
of my research on the ancient writings about
the legend of "the Hole." I believe that actual historical events
are described in them. The master of the Great Lake
once created the "Ama no Goko," but its power was taken away
by evil. This evil hated everything… and by using the "power,"
it tried to destroy the world. The "power" covered
the world and… was on the verge of destroying it. But just by chance, one of the dead picked up
a shard of the "power." And it turned crimson…
and was enveloped in flames. And it took revenge on
the tainted one. After seven hours
of fighting in purgatory… finally, the one in flames
emerged victorious. In order to prevent the "power"
from being stolen by the next evil, the crimson one divided "power"
into seven sounds, and sealed away this "Saezuri." That's a quick summary. "Saezuri"… That's what Kabuto stole? That's if it really exists. Ama no Hoko… What could it be? This is just a guess. But it's something that
surpasses human knowledge. Undoubtedly… One gets the feeling that a deep,
dark secret lies hidden in that "Hole." However, even if they conspired
to steal the treasure, that's no reason to kill
innocent villagers. Such an act is unforgivable! I totally agree. Kabuto will be made to
answer to his crimes. I'm counting on you. Naruto. Everyone's going to
the outdoor bath. Huh? I get to bathe with you, Sakura? As if! – Wow…
– Wow… No wonder
he's a legendary hero… Hey, if you guys train,
maybe you'll be able to do it too. – Really?!
– Really?! Damn! Once more! You're famous even in
a rural place like this. I thought you'd be more
fierce and scary. I'm shocked at how young
and easy-going you are! It's amazing… Your body must store
immense power. When I was your age,
I couldn't even save a single girl. Shiseru… What are those…? These scars? I fell from a cliff
a long, long time ago. What?! About 50 meters, maybe? Luckily, I fell onto a tree! But how…? I was careless. Stop it, Shiseru. – Brother kept warning me too.
– It's dangerous. Wanna fight?! Did Dokku…? Uh-huh. He grabbed me immediately… and held on tight
for what seemed like an hour. I hated exercise and
my arms were weak. I was so frustrated
and angry at myself… If I had let Shiseru die… I… Really, it was all my fault. It wasn't his fault at all. I hated myself for being weak,
so I was determined to be a guard. And I did my best, but… I wasn't suited to it, after all. Then we drifted apart. Even when I went to see him,
there was a wall between us… And before I knew it,
we were like strangers. But that night… If only I… I was so happy to see him
after so long, but… If only I had more power… More strength… Brother's probably
beating himself up right now. I wish I could've saved
more people! He lost so many people
who were dear to him. I can't do it! It's impossible! Naruto! Show us the trick
to doing it! Sure! I noticed something was
wrong in the village just around bedtime. All of a sudden, the village
was engulfed in a sea of flames. A shinobi attacked me too. He was so strong,
I thought I was going to die. Suddenly, he stopped moving. It was as though some
puppet strings had been cut. The Reanimation Jutsu is
a Forbidden Jutsu that uses the sacrificed body
as a vessel… It imbeds the soul of a dead person
and forces it back to life. It was believed that only the Second Hokage and
Orochimaru knew how to use it. It seems that under
the Akatsuki's control, he's failed… and the jutsu still hasn't
been perfected. Do you know about the "Saezuri"? The ancient writing? That's what Kabuto seeks. Do you know any thing about
the "Saezuri" that could help us? Take this and run! Throw it away somewhere,
that's fine. However, never say
a word of this to anyone! No…not especially. I see… We'll be joining up with
the Security Unit tomorrow and begin our pursuit. However, there is the guard
that was captured. Just to be safe, I'll assign
someone to keep watch over you. Thank you. Also, about the children
you rescued. The town's willing to
make arrangements with an institution to take them in. What would you like to do? They're fast asleep. Yes… The kids actually laughed today. It's the first time since that night… Kabuto… You're so violent with your jutsu. You didn't have to
kill them all. BUT IT'S FUN For you, right? OROCHIMARU WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME THING I've improved the jutsu technique
by adjusting it to my chakra. It'll be easy to control this time. It's time I also tested… situations involving intent
and memory. BY THE WAY,
I STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH THERE MIGHT BE
SOMEONE WHO HAS IT So? Do I have to look for it? THAT'S BEEN THE ORDER
SINCE THE START You really like to make me work. Well, that's fine. This just gives me something
to look forward to. WHAT? Naruto… I want to see you!

 Papa, Mama!

 I'm so lonely!
I'm so lonely!

 Why are you lonely?!

 They're with you always!!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Power - Episode 3" Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!! Tune in again!

 Mina…? I'll go ask him about
what happened earlier. His genetic data slumbers here. The sacrifice is still alive too. I don't think it's a cold. Is he all right? Could it have been the breakfast? Oh no, no! He's been feeling like this
since yesterday. Brother Naruto! Time to train! Our ninjutsu! Everyone, Naruto's not feeling well… Huh? You were gonna
teach us self-defense… And you're supposed to be
a Hidden Leaf hero? All right, guys! In order to overcome all sorts
of hardship and challenges, you need to build up
your strength and physical fitness! But training without a set plan
isn't gonna work! And so! I put together… – He's so eager…
– all my years of harsh training and… I named it,
"Naruto's Powerful Miracle Training"! Looks interesting. – Why don't you try it too, Brother?
– If you do this training, you'll be effective
when the time comes! It looks hard… I don't want to do anything tiring. Don't be such a wimp!
Put your all into everything you do! – Got it!
– Got it! All right! First, we'll run to the lake! Man, this is lame… No kidding…hmm. What's this diversion anyway? You don't even know what it means?
What are you, stupid? No! I'm just saying being used
by Kabuto is the worst! Being immortal was your best trait. Yet look at you,
you're all in pieces. So pitiful. Huh? What about you?
What happened to blowing yourself up? No, with my Ultimate Art… I scattered in an extraordinarily
sublime manner, hmm. What's to brag about? You died. You're in the same situation! This is the end of training! I worked up a nice sweat! That was easy! You all did great.
I'll go buy some drinks. Wait, okay? Naruto…
That's so uncool. I'm not feeling
a hundred percent today… – Are you really a hero?
– Cut it out! Sounds like a lie. You're always harping
about art this, art that. But the explosives you design
are so trashy. Idiot! Well, your ceremonies are
always so damn long! Think about how I feel,
having to follow you. I don't need you to do
anything after me, you fake! Shut up! You can't even do anything if
you step out of the curse symbol. So there! Hmm! Huh? Then maybe
I should curse you! Not before I blow you up
with my art! We're done warming up! Yeah! – Can I get ice cream from that shop?
– Of course! – Do it!
– Do it! – Watch me, Dad!
– Oh! – Is it good?
– Yeah! I'm glad you like it! – Over here!
– Wait up! Papa… Mama… Papa… Mom… Mama! Dad! I wish I could see them… I wish I could see them… I miss them… I miss them… Why are you lonely? There's someone
who's always with you! Hey, you're making no effort
to lose that weight, are you? That's not true. When I'm all healed,
I'll start exercising. Oh yeah?
Then I'll oversee your training! Hi…there… What's the matter, everyone? Naruto? You pushed yourself too hard. I'll be fine once I get some sleep. Take… Take it… Take it… Take it… Take it… Take it… Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Hey! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! – That's enough, Mina.
– Get out! –What's the matter?
– Get out! Get out! Get out! – Don't say such rude things to Naruto!
– Get out! Get out! Get out! – Mina! Mina!
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Mina! She doesn't like you. Did I do something?
I don't understand. Do you really feel all right? I'm fine… Let me examine you. Huh? Hey, not like that…
Stop it, Sakura… Stop wiggling around! Why am I worrying
about you anyway?! Isn't that the chief of the village? I wanted to let you know,
so I rushed over. This man came to
the town hall this morning. Chief! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! I'm so glad you're both all right. And you too, Chief. I injured my eyes… I was wandering across the wilderness
when someone saved me. Dokku, I put such a burden
on your shoulders. Oh, no such thing. By the way, I have something
important to ask you. Yes? Do you remember
that item I gave you that night? You may already have guessed… But, that was a portion of the treasure
which was hidden in the village altar. To protect it from robbers, I entrusted parts of it to another guard,
just as I did to you. Regrettably, five of the parts
including mine… are now in their hands. The remaining two must
be protected at all cost. That is why I intend to
ask Disonasu here to take custody of them,
and keep them safe. Yes. You're sure about this? Yes. That's my decision. I understand. And…where are the rest? Yes, that's… Don't! Grandpa is strange! Huh? – Huh? He's…
– a Reanimation?! That girl is sharp. Is she special? Kabuto! We've been tricked! I'm taking fatso over there
and getting information out of him. And then… Chief… Grandpa! A sacrifice that's almost dead
is useless, huh? I'm very sorry! What's wrong, Naruto?! Take it. Take it. Get out, get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out! – Mina, stop that!
– Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out! – Mina, Mina…!
– Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out! – Mina!
– Get out! Get out of Brother Naruto! The Nine Tails' power, eh… Why you…! POWER People like you
with immense power…

 Even if you choose to use that power
for good or evil,

 you still have to shoulder the weight
of having such a huge responsibility.

 What made you want
to become stronger?

 Next time on                                               
 Naruto Shippuden:      "Power – Episode 4" That strong conviction inside
will surely guide you. Tune in again!

 It has such a fiendish appearance! You're real bad news,
aren't you?! That's Naruto transformed
into the Nine Tails. Huh?! Although it's different from
a Shadow Clone. The Nine Tails' chakra is immense! It's a clone that's no different
from the real thing. Not only that, it even seems to have
copied the Nine Tails' chakra. Naruto! A counterfeit, eh…
like the way Hidan was created. When did you do it to Naruto? It was by chance. And I never expected these results. I won't let you get away! This is going to be…
quite amusing. This is…how shinobi fight… Awesome! Lee, let's do it! Right! More… More… power! Lady Hinata! Power! Good… This is good… I'm more than happy to
give you more chakra! A person? It's a person. He fell from the sky? That's…! What was that?! Kakashi! All right! We're going to
rescue the townspeople. Shiseru! Take care of the kids! Brother! Let's go! Shiseru…! Naruto, Naruto! – Sensei!
– Sensei! Out of the way! Excuse us! Yes, and then we became aware… that the village chief was
nowhere to be found. I just hope that he's all right. I hope so too. Excuse me… Good news, everyone! There were no fatalities! That's a relief… But what about Naruto and Dokku? Mister? Naruto! According to Shiseru, just as
they were about to be trampled, something like
a giant snake appeared. There were no bodies,
so in all likelihood… Kabuto has them. Akatsuki members suddenly stopped
in the middle of fighting… Which means Kabuto
achieved his goals. Where are we? I don't know. When I came to,
I found myself here. Wait… And the Nine Tails' clone
or whatever… It lost its power quickly. Kabuto seemed to have
a hard time controlling it. He probably hasn't perfected
the process yet. Just what was his objective
in the first place? Compared to the level of
the Reanimated Shinobi, they didn't seem to
be fighting seriously. I'm so glad that you're not hurt. Thank you. Take care… Yes. Shiseru… I guess we just have
to have faith… that those two are all right. Brother… Where are the kids? Mina gets scared at the sight
of blood and injured people, so I took her home for now. Accept it… That is your true nature. You and I are of
one mind, one body. So… give in to me. SEAL Free… me! Naruto… Naruto, Naruto… Are you all right? – Leave me alone!
– Leave me alone! Sorry about that. Get out, get out, get out! – Mina! Mina!
– Get out! Get out, get out! Mina! Oh dear, what have I done… I'm not even her mother. But I slapped her very hard. I think you did that because
you truly care about her. But I know Mina well… from the time
we were in the village. She wouldn't do that.
She's not like that. I'm sure there's a reason. I guess letting the facility take
the kids in is the right thing to do. It's in their best interest. Besides…I can't keep relying
on you. I… Actually, I was thinking
how nice it would be to take the kids and live together. How lively it would be… All the laughter and the tears…
and the occasional fights… And if someone were
to always be by my side… Would you be against it? You can stay my "Brother." What do you say? You're still not… Do you still blame yourself
for that? It wasn't your fault! Everything's okay! Don't say that. You can't have children
because of that… I'm sorry… Please… Please let
everyone be safe. Sorry, mister. I'm to blame. He's part of me. He exists deep inside me… It's my other nature. If anything happens to
Auntie or the kids… I'll… You're wrong.
You were used! That's not you. Not that— That thing is me! I'll kill… I'll destroy…everything! I will destroy it all! Sakura… Get ready. We leave shortly. Yes, sir. But where are we going? To the "Hole." Kabuto is probably there. I'm going with you! Please let me come. You're shinobi, so I'll probably
be a nuisance, but… You'll be no such thing. We understand what it means
to care for someone. Let's go together! People like you with
immense power… Even if you choose to use
that power for good or evil… you still have to shoulder the weight
of having such a huge responsibility. What made you want
to become stronger? Was it your desire for power? To protect…my friends…
those dear to me. I want to…save my friends… No doubt it's that intense desire… that is guiding your strength. Do not waver. I believe… in you! I picked it up for you. I believe in you… I believe in your power… in the good inside you! Let's go save Sensei! That's crazy, we'll be killed. It's too dangerous. Besides, Shiseru told us
to wait here. Without Sensei, we'd be dead. And… I have what those guys want. We'll ask them to
return Sensei for these! This time, it's our turn
to save Sensei! Uh-huh! Yeah! Uh-huh! Let's go! – Okay!
– Okay! But go where? Where else? Back to our village! Chief?! Enough of this farce! If that fool from the town hall
hadn't reported this to the government, everything would be
over and done with. You… Do you even know
the value of that "sound" you have in your possession? SAEZURI I'll get him!

 Amazing! Amazing!
This is amazing!

 This is impressive…

 This is the "Ama no Hoko"?

 Up to now, I've been taught
a lot of important things

 from a lot of people…

 I won't give up now that
we've come this far!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Power - Episode 5" My power is…! Tune in again!
 
 This is…the Saezuri… that has slumbered here
for many years. It is a legacy from ages past! I wasn't expecting such resistance
from the guards, so obtaining it wasn't easy… Then… The village head should've
minded his own business. I wasted precious time
in gathering the "sounds." Then the one
who attacked the village… That was me. I put him up to it. Why you—! Do you know what
I went through in order to regain
the power I lost…? After learning about the legend,
I went as far as becoming the head of
the village to dig around… and uncover the hidden secret. So, where are
the remaining "sounds"? I don't have time to waste. If you tell me,
I will let you die painlessly. Or maybe,
I should kill you and make you talk with
the Reanimation. Why you—! And you, Naruto.
You're amazing! I hear you brought down Pain
of the Akatsuki. Even someone like me
couldn't beat him. That's how I lost my power. – But I lived…
– I could care less about your past! If you lay a hand on him,
I'll kill you! Those snakes…consume chakra… The more you increase your chakra,
the tighter they squeeze. You bastard!
You're so full of yourself. Just who do you think you are? H-Here! This is what you want, right? You can have it,
so let Dokku Sensei and Naruto go! It seems these kids
had the "sounds." What?! They're up above. It seems they're so brave,
they've come to save you. Kabuto… He's likely a clone…
and about five children. The kids! I wondered
where they went… Why? In any case,
let's approach cautiously. – Sensei!
– Sensei! Everyone! Stop! Don't lay a hand on the children! I got them all! I got all seven of them! I did it! I actually did it! Now my "power" will return! How can I…?! Consume…chakra? One takes control of
the "power" by activating it with a combination of
seven "sounds." By varying the sound patterns, you can increase and
decrease the level of "power." Inputting this sound can
be a manual operation… Or it will automatically renew
its power every 12 hours. If a certain sound pattern does
not exist and is not recognized, the previous pattern
will be maintained. If this is correct… Mina! How could you be so reckless?! Because… We wanted… …to see you, Sensei! Amazing…amazing…
This is amazing! This is impressive… This is…the "Ama no Hoko"? If this is the activation pattern, the way to release "power" is…! Too much ambition…is destructive. This is no longer something
people should use. I verified it on an old bulletin
of wanted persons… Apparently,
it was believed you died in a scuffle with the Akatsuki. You specialized in
the Summoning Jutsu, and you were known
as a homicidal maniac who claimed
several thousand victims. Along with Orochimaru, you researched the forbidden
Reanimation Jutsu… Give up, Disonasu! Brother! Shiseru? You're…! That guy is mine! Naruto! Naruto… Naruto… It's all over for you guys! Ino! Choji! Sakura! Get a little taste of some art! Art is… an explosion! He needs to create a Curse Mark
in order to perform the ritual. So we can't give him
a chance to do so… No way… What are you…? This power of yours… Over the years, I've been taught
a lot of important things from a lot of people…. Even now, I learned something
from an incredibly strong person. My "power" isn't the Rasengan
or Sage Jutsu… or the Nine Tails' chakra. My power is… right here! Sai! A reanimated shinobi
that doesn't resurrect? I guess…
they were sacrificial pawns. We finally got you! Why you—! Your ability is useless without
back-up support. It's because it requires
so many steps. Support, huh? Well then… Damn, he's such a nuisance! Now then! That's as far as you'll go. As if… I'm gonna… Give it up. Like I'm gonna give up
at this point! This is…! Hey! What the hell…?
Damn you! Looks like that clone snake
that constitutes you has a big defect… They reach maturity quickly, but their lifespan
is just as short. That about explains it. Just in case, I came up
with 20 more strategies… I guess that wasn't necessary. What was that just now?! The ground caved in… This terrain was raised up
and supported by tree roots… We have to get away from
the "Hole" immediately! Y-Yeah. Sensei!
Is that thing going to stop? Power will cloak the world…
and destroy it… "Power…" If I bathe in that "power"… That's why
I'll never let go again!

 If I do, we'll fall together!

 I've been in love with you
since then!

 But who's going to protect
the children?!

 You're the only one!

 You're the only one
who can save their future!

 But… But!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Power – Final Episode" Please. Save us.

 Tune in again!

 Are you sure you should be
spending your time on me? Because it seems like you've got
some trouble on your hands… Don't underestimate us. Are you going to do
something about that too? Naruto! Are you going to die? Are you going to die here? That good-for-nothing… I'll lend you some… "Power"… Power? Control…your "power." Control my "power"? Naruto! I can't…let it end here.  I know you can do it. I believe… in you… That's amazing… But…it's not
the Nine Tails transformation. Naruto… He escaped… Naruto! Dokku! It's dangerous here!
You must get away. But…I must stop that. I know. Leave it to us. I… I was fired,
but I used to be a village guard. Protecting this place…
the "Hole"… is my duty. All right. You can't do it alone. No! It's too dangerous! You think you can get there
in your current condition? Please, let's go together. Sensei… I don't want you to go… Don't go! – Sensei!
– Sensei! All of you… Faz, you can't be
picky anymore. Don't complain even
if it doesn't taste good. You need to become strong,
and look after everyone. Lando, you're the oldest,
so take charge. If anyone's in trouble,
help them. Do your best. Sora, take care of everyone. Especially Mina…
Watch over her. Leo, there may be
tough times ahead, and sad times too. But do your best to
help everyone out! Mina… Please, Mina! I'm sorry I slapped you that day. You were the only one who sensed
that Naruto wasn't himself… I didn't realize it. I'm so sorry! Things will probably
get tough from here… But hang in there and
do your best! I want you, your brother,
and the others… to be strong, and live! We weren't together too long,
but it was fun. They were such happy times. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. I love you. I love you. All of you…
Please look after the children! Yes. We'll do everything in our power. Shiseru! – Sensei!
– Sensei! Brother! If… If we make it out of here alive… Huh?! If we make it out of here alive…! Let's get married! You finally said it! Well then, we're gonna get
through this, no matter what! There it is! The "Saezuri"! That guy said it was
the combination of sounds. Like what? I don't know. That's it! Mina's melody! The one she's always been humming! Kill… Destroy… the entire world! This should work! Naruto! Naruto?! This is bad! He's completely lost control
of himself! What?! Shiseru! Shiseru! Hurry… Climb up! I can't… I think it's dislocated! Huh?! Sakura… Heal me. What? Hurry! – Thanks!
– Don't mention it. The Nine Tails is too strong, I don't know if I can
keep restraining him! He's in pain. Mina! I can't do it! We have to try something else! Don't give up… Brother, stop it. I'm prepared to die! No! I won't let go! There's no time left! Hurry and stop
the "Ama no Hoko"! Like hell I will! I'm not going to watch
the person I love fall again! Never again! I've loved you! Since forever
and ever and ever! That's why I desperately
held on, but… I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! That's why I'll never let go again! If I do, we'll fall together! I've been in love
with you too, since then! Even if I grew taller… And you kept getting fatter,
and lost your hair… Even if you were indecisive
and scared of everything… Even if you kept turning away
from me! All that time, I still loved you! But who's going to protect
the children? You're the only one! You're the only one who
can save their future! But… But…! Please…save them… To protect…my friends…
those dear to me.  I want to save my friends.  My papa and mama… I believe… – I believe in your power…
– in the good inside you.  …in you.  Brother Naruto! Please! Save them! Our… – Papa and Mama!
– Papa and Mama! Please save the world… and protect…the children… I love you… I love you so much… my precious… Na… Naruto? Mister! Hurry up and stop that thing! Don't get…in his way! "Power - Episode Final" Brother Naruto! Brother Naruto! You guys are heavy! Thank you for saving me, Naruto! Thank you! Thank you so much! Sure thing! Madara, I'll never forgive you for
resurrecting the Jinchuriki

 with the Reanimation Jutsu!

 I'll end this war!

 Naruto's now able to sense
his enemies.

 He has no choice,
but to join the battle.

 All according to plan!

 Today, the Senju's Will of Fire
will be extinguished!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto Enters the Battle!"

 It's time for me to make
my appearance! Tune in again!

 NINJA NETWORK NEWS





Ninja Network News! Good evening,
I am Mabui of the Cloud. I'm Shikaku Nara. Today, we'll be bringing you
the latest news from various battlefronts via satellite. Before that,
here are some highlights from battles that continue
to rage on the frontlines. On the desert front,
the standoff continues between Gaara's Fourth Company
and the previous Kage. On the coastal front, Darui and his First Company
sustained heavy losses when the enemy summoned
a giant humanoid. However, they succeeded in
eliminating most of the enemy force. The Third Company under Kakashi
are sealing away the Ninja Swordsmen
one after another. The company has been split up
into smaller units and expanded the area
of fierce fighting, in order to take down
remaining enemies. Mifune's Fifth Company have joined up
with the Commando Unit. Deidara's escape was unexpected, but they were successful
in recapturing him. Next up, we have news
about White Zetsu. His jutsu with which he mimics
not only appearances, but even chakra, has created chaos
within the Allied Force… However, thanks to
the fine observations of Sakura Haruno of
the Medical Unit, our genius strategist, Shikaku,
has been able to draw up a counter strategy. I'm refining the strategy right now,
so please be patient just a bit longer. At the front, Sakura has just
begun a news conference in order to get data out
about White Zetsu. I understand you received
a love letter, but rejected it immediately.
Is this true? Err…N-No, that's… That hasn't been the only declaration
of love you've received, has it? U-Um… Please… You supposedly said that
you're already in love… – Who is this person?!
– Please tell us! That has nothing to do with
this news conference!! Cha! Whoa… The "Kosuke Kills" corner
was scheduled in this time slot… but we just received an update. According to this bulletin, the key figures of the
Fourth Great Ninja World War, Killer Bee the Eight Tails and
Naruto the Nine Tails, have persuaded Lady Tsunade
and Lord Raikage… and at long last, they are heading
towards the battlefield. I'm amazed that they were able
to convince those two. Looks like we have a satellite link
with the duo. Let's ask them if they're excited
about joining the war effort. Naruto… Naruto? Was the link broken? Is the equipment malfunctioning? I'm not sure… Okay, it seems we're connected now. All right, let's try again.
Naruto! So do I talk into this
as I'm running? Stay put, so the camera can focus. And I'll plant a kiss
on you like this. Hey! Get out of my way! What are those two doing?! We're still on the air… Naruto Enters the Battle

 If Kisame's intel is correct,
Naruto now has the same ability, just like Mito Uzumaki,
the wife of the First Hokage, to sense the enemy. Naruto will have no choice. He'll have to battle
with White Zetsu. It's all going according to plan… Today, the Senju's Will of Fire
shall be extinguished. The two Kage who block their path
and refuse to let them go are… Lord Raikage and Lady Tsunade. Demanding that
they get out of the way, Naruto makes his approach. The indomitable Bee is quick
to react and jumps in to assist. Shockingly, Lady Tsunade
steps aside to let them pass, inciting Lord Raikage
to roar his dissent. But the sun inside Naruto
softens his heart… The light of brotherly love and
parental love burns so bright, it makes him squint. And so, he relents
and lets them go. In an intense,
touching moment between men… Lady Tsunade and Lord Raikage
let Naruto have his way. Oh sorry… Lady Tsunade isn't a man. This is momentous. To think that Lord Raikage
could be persuaded… I'm not that surprised. There's something about Naruto that makes the impossible
seem possible. But…this could be just
what the enemy is hoping for. Consider White Zetsu's
Transformation Jutsu. It's as though it's used specifically
to lure Naruto out. It definitely could be a trap. However, we have no choice,
but to leave this in Naruto's hands. No one is allowed near
Lady Shizune's tent! Anyone making a move will
be considered an enemy! So, just stay put! Don't move! You must not move! Sakura, take a look at
this genetic sequence data! It's finally done?! It has changed and become
even more like Captain Yamato's than it was at
the Five Kage Summit! In other words, there's very little difference from
the First Hokage's genetic data. So it was true. What are you saying?! What's this about the white guy
and the First Hokage? Namely, this white guy is
a clone of the First Hokage. Or rather, judging from
how many there are, the First Hokage's cells
were cultivated and using mobile plants as a medium,
clones that can move were created. They are diluted in strength,
but they still use the Wood Style. Huh?! I still don't get it… I don't get it, but I'm supposed to guard you
against plants. Right? Well then, how about
using termites? Looking at this data,
I'm sure Captain Yamato is being used to make
these clones stronger. I'll notify HQ immediately! I'm back! I got word that those white beings
are transforming, and are causing havoc
on the battlefield. Perhaps it's too much
of a coincidence, but letting Naruto go
couldn't have been timed better. I agree. Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a report
from the Medical Team. It's data about those white beings. Give it to me! Who would have thought that
Madara and Orochimaru's fixation on the First Hokage
would create this? Botanical Ninja created
from Grandfather's body. This is proof that Madara has possession of
the First Hokage's cells! He's cultivated them and developed a way
to replicate them. Including his own body. No wonder he's been
able to live this long. Well? Do we have an idea
of how to destroy him? No… Just the opposite… Now, we don't even know
what will kill him. It seems Madara is really…immortal! An immortal leader and
his mobile plants… Reanimation zombies… Not a normal human among them. Notify Naruto and Bee immediately about the White Beings'
Transformation Technique! Naruto, please listen carefully.
You too, Lord Bee. I am transmitting this message
directly into your minds. Let me explain the enemy's battle jutsu
and their objective. Pay close attention. That explains all the weird,
fuzzy sensations I've been having. I guess I have no choice,
but to step up. Yeah! But remember, I mentioned
that Madara's Project Tsuki no Me won't work without
your Tailed Beasts… That means you two are his targets. I know that! As if I'd sit still and
let them capture me! Then this time, don't even think about
negotiating with him, Naruto. Madara is different from
Pain and Nagato. He has no interest in peace. He's a truly evil man
who covets the entire world. Controlling people requires
the skill to manipulate the darkness in their souls. Although, Nagato just happened
to be easily influenced. Don't compare yourself with Nagato! His ways were different,
but he truly wished for peace! But you're different! You're right. The appearance of an Uchiha…
gathering Tailed Beasts… Just what is your goal? What do you hope to accomplish? Let's see… If anything,
it's to become complete. And with Project Tsuki no Me, he'll be able to completely control
humans through genjutsu… That's about it.
So don't let down your guard! I once talked to Madara
in the Land of Iron. He told me about
the Uchiha Clan's destiny. He knows all about hatred,
and took advantage of Nagato. He's the one fueling
Sasuke's hatred too. I know how evil he is. He doesn't act out of hatred.
He simply exploits hatred. He's unlike any other foe
you've faced, so be careful! In any case, I'm going to
pulverize Madara and bring this war to an end! Only then can we talk. I don't know about Kabuto, but Madara is supposedly immortal. Furthermore, those mobile plants
that were restructured with the First Hokage's cells… You know,
those otherworldly zombies… Nothing works against them
except by sealing. Talk about an undead army. Beware of them too! That's the only piece of
good news. I don't have to worry
about holding back! That's… It's chaos out there
in the battlefield! We've got to get back and
shore up HQ's defense! Rasengan! Naruto?! Leave it all to Naruto here. Those he gives his stamp of approval.
Are the only ones I'll give an ear. They're all enemies! Let's do this, Octopops! Rasenrangan! Rasenkyugan! Naruto's attack is affecting
the Wood Style, and turning them back
into wood? It's just like before… This way, we won't be so vulnerable
to the effects of his attack. Mini-Rasen Shuriken… Summoning, Mayhem Jutsu! All right! Yay! The fruits of training.
Thanks to my mentoring. Yay… I'll leave my Shadow Clones
and Mr. Gamahiro to keep an eye here. Let's go! I'm gonna hit all the battlefields
at the same time! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! It's no good. He caught up to us! H-He's…?! He's a Cloud Ninja with
a Kekkei Genkai! Magnet Style Toroi! The Hidden Cloud has
a Magnet Style user too? When he attacks, you must always… You Idiot! I said you always
have to dodge it! Huh? You didn't say that! I didn't have time to finish
my sentence! His Magnet Style magnetizes
any object that he touches. And subsequently, anything those
things touch becomes magnetized… although the effect is not
as strong. You are the first transfer point
to have touched the shuriken, so the magnetic power
in your body is… Huh? What exactly do you mean? Right now, your body is infused
with magnetic power since his shuriken is magnetic. Which means,
your body and his shuriken are going to be
drawn to each other. Which means, in his second attack, you won't be able to dodge it! That means I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die! Rasengan! Are you guys okay? What is all this ruckus? Lord Bee!
What are you doing here? Are you okay? You shouldn't be here! Those white beings are disguising
themselves as our comrades. I know that. So this is one of the zombies controlled by
the Reanimation Jutsu… Looks like sealing them like this is the only way to stop them. We were rushing back to
Headquarters with Eff to tighten the security there,
but got separated… Eff was actually a white guy. Huh?! Things here have gone awry. Octopops, we have to catch up
with everyone else. Yeah! If Eff and the others
were imposters… – You…
– You… No, both of us were almost
killed by the enemy. So we're okay. Y-You're right. Gotcha! Are you trying to kill me?! It's your fault for joking around
at a time like this! We can't retreat any further. We'll have to make our stand here! I agree. First, the two of us will launch
long-range offensives. We'll see how the enemy responds! They were slowly retreating, but it seems they've made up
their minds. Fighting those from other villages
is understandable. But we are forced to
bring ourselves to take on shinobi from
our homelands. Damn that brat Orochimaru
for controlling us! He will regret this! I never saw eye to eye
with you before, but for the first time,
I agree with you. Do not lament. I'm certain our children have grown
and surpassed us. I hope you are right… Here they come. First, two of them. Look at those
amazing waves of sand! This is Shukaku… The power of the One Tail… So they're starting off with
the Playing Possum Jutsu? Gold Dust? I see… You were the shinobi
who manipulated Gold Dust with the Magnet Style… It stopped. Gold Dust is heavier than sand… If I mix Gold Dust into
the sand, I can slow it down. I'm impressed that you knew
how to counter it. When Shukaku the One Tail
would go on a rampage, I'd stop his sand like this. It's not Shukaku…but Gaara?! From above… You've aged, Ohnoki! Do you owe your long life
to the Particle Style? – Particle Style!
– Particle Style! – Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!
– Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! My predecessor's Particle Style…
is as powerful as ever. The sand is even more powerful
than before… Wait for the signal. Particle Style… Don't tell me that's
your former pupil, the brat Ohnoki? Now I really feel like
I traveled through time! It's been a while…Father. Gaara… Where's Shukaku? He's long gone. I am no longer the Jinchuriki
that you created, Father. I am Kazekage now.

 It is a leader's duty to eliminate
threats against one's village.

 We must protect it.

 This Reanimation Jutsu may
have some merit, after all…

 Let me see what
you may be worth!

 Can you defeat me?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Father's Hope, A Mother's Love" 

 A FATHER'S HOPE,
A MOTHER'S LOVE

Karura, you… A FATHER'S HOPE,
A MOTHER'S LOVE

 Tune in again!

 A Father's Hope,
A Mother's Love

 You're no longer a Jinchuriki?! What do you mean? The ones that are controlling you
extracted the Shukaku from me. That killed me once. Sealing Jutsu!
Nine Phantom Dragons! Just what… am I? But thanks to Chiyo and my friends,
here I am, alive. Granny Chiyo… She did that?! And friends? You have friends?! The things I did in the past
were nothing but mistakes. But in my last hour, it seems I'm finally able
to do the right thing. The Village of the Sand and the Leaf Village… The future is likely to be different from the way things were
in our time. Gaara… Gaara! Naruto… This is…? Everyone came to help you. You thought he'd have no friends? Man, he must've been
some lonely kid, huh? At that age,
everyone has friends. Father, you tried to kill me
six times. And each time,
my fear and hatred of you grew. But I no longer hate you. I can understand
why you did it. I am the Kazekage now. It is a leader's duty to eliminate
threats against one's village. We must protect it. You are…the Kazekage? That's not all. He is also
the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Shinobi Forces'
Main Battle Regiment. Despite his age,
he not only calls himself Kage, he has the respect of
all the other Kage as well. No wonder… I thought it was odd
I sensed chakra types from various villages mixed together. Imagine that, shinobi
forming an alliance. Not having eyebrows makes
a face more charismatic… Oh hey,
I don't have eyebrows either. Then what about that wisp
of a moustache, Mizukage? Guys, if you're going to kill us,
start with the mummy here! I'll be more than happy
to root for you. He's your son, huh. He's a fine shinobi. He's small…
So he was premature? Are you sure he'll be all right? He's adapting. At last, with the third child,
we know he's compatible. This child must be brought up
with great care. Please let me see…
my child's face. Are you all right, Karura?! He's…so tiny. Lady Karura's heart rate
is dropping. Do something! Quick! This child is a failure as well. The rampages have begun. If we can't maintain
our defenses further the Sand will be weakened
beyond repair. We need to figure out how
we can negotiate with other lands, and we have to do something
about the Shukaku. As long as the Jinchuriki is unreliable, we must rely on Lord Kazekage's
development of new jutsu, and in our gold dust trade
for village stability. As for Gaara… Yashamaru, I need to speak
to you later. Yes… But Lord Gaara is still a child… Over the years, I've had to judge
the value of many things. And I must test his worth too. We will assess Gaara tomorrow. After the village has been evacuated,
corner Gaara. Tell him about his mother,
and provoke him emotionally. If he doesn't go berserk,
I won't kill him. About my sister?! Are you sure about this? I know that he loves and
respects Karura with all his heart. If that is taken away from him,
and if he can still suppress his rage… then and only then,
will he suffice as a Jinchuriki! What? Why me…?! Why only me?! Who is it? Why? I must hand it to you, Lord Gaara. Yashamaru…! Why? Why? Why you…Yashamaru? Why? It was an order. I was ordered to kill you. By your father…the Kazekage. Father? Why does Father want me dead? Lord Gaara, before you were born, the Shukaku of the Sand
was placed inside you. And you were nurtured carefully
because of that experiment. However, you are unable
to control the power of the vengeful Spirit of the Sand,
the Shukaku. Thus, you pose a threat to the village. Before any more damage is done… So you had no choice, but to go along with
Father's orders, Yashamaru? No, that's not so. It's true, I was ordered
by Lord Kazekage. However, I could have refused
if I chose to do so. Lord Gaara… Deep down, I'm sure I resented you. You…who stole my dear older sister's life
when you were born. You were my late sister's legacy. So I desperately tried to love you. But I couldn't. My sister never wanted you. She was sacrificed for the village, and she died cursing it. My heart has borne the wounds
of that moment, and it has never healed. My sister gave you that name. Her words were… "This child will be known as Gaara,
a demon that loves only itself." "Love only yourself and
fight only for yourself." "Then you will continue to exist." That was her wish. But she didn't name you
out of love or concern. She gave you that name hoping
that you would survive. She died resenting and
cursing this world, leaving you as reminder. So that the world would
remember her hatred. You were never loved. It's a failure, after all. Gaara is a failed experiment. This Reanimation Jutsu may have
some merit, after all. Let me see what
you may be worth! Can you defeat me?! Ohnoki… Stop me. Against my Particle Style,
the number of opponents means nothing. Only you can stop me. I'm aware of that. Also, you remember what
to do with allies after a victory, don't you? Once the fighting ends,
so is the alliance. There will be a scramble
for the spoils of war. That is what truly decides
which village is the victor. Hey, Tsuchikage, quit playing dirty! I won't let that happen. I have no intentions of doing
such a thing, Lord Mu. I see… I guess you didn't turn into
a stubborn old geezer. I wouldn't be too sure. In any case, we have no control
over our movements. Our bodies are set to automatically
counter the enemy's jutsu. So hurry and kill us, and send us
back to the netherworld. We will tell you what
our weaknesses and powers are. You just have to stop our actions! It's not going to be easy. Everyone, go! Let's go! – Right!
– Right! Sand Hail! Damn it! Sand Hail is just a diversion. He used it to force me to
lift the Gold Dust! Karura… You still live on
inside this child… That really is our old man… You've grown, Gaara. All a parent needs to do is
to believe in their children. Just that little bit is
the most valuable treasure. Isn't that right, Karura? It seems I didn't possess the ability
to see the true value of things… What do you mean? No matter when or what,
the Sand will always protect you. That's not the Shukaku's power. But it's your mother's…Karura's. He's so tiny. No matter what happens,
I will always protect you, Gaara. Your mother loved you! Mother…loved me? But that day when Yashamaru
came after me, he said… You were never…loved. I ordered Yashamaru to lie to you. In order to provoke you, and to test the volatility of
the Tailed Beast inside you… For the sake of the village. If there was anyone
Yashamaru hated… it would be me, not you. I'm the one who sealed
the Shukaku of the Sand into his pregnant older sister. But Yashamaru was also a shinobi. He was my right-hand man and
a member of the Sand Black Ops. So he did as he was ordered,
for the sake of the village. I failed. It seems I failed
in everything I did. I burdened you unnecessarily, and arbitrarily decided that
you weren't worth anything. I took away your future
by turning you into the Jinchuriki and I took your mother away
from you. I robbed you of your love
for your mother. I took away the bonds you had
with people. And I even tried to take your life. As a parent… there is only one thing
that I gave you. I gave you a broken heart. It's not bleeding. But it really hurts right
around here. Physical wounds will definitely bleed
and may look painful. But over time,
they heal by themselves. And if you apply medicine,
they will heal faster. What's troublesome are
wounds of the heart. Nothing is harder to heal. Wounds of the heart? They're a bit different
from physical injuries. You can't apply medicine,
for one thing. And sometimes, they never heal. There's only one cure for
a wound of the heart. It's a bit bothersome and you can only receive it
from someone else. What is it? It's love. – Love?
– Yes. How do I get it? You've already received it,
Lord Gaara. Mother… I believe your mother
loved you immensely. Essentially, Shukaku of the Sand is
a wraith to be used for offensive assaults. But when the Sand instinctively
acts to protect you… That is your mother's love. I believe your mother's will
has seeped into the Sand. My sister…even in death…
wanted to protect you, Lord Gaara. Karura… Mothers are powerful. She's dead, but she believed
in you and still protects you. She's the one who has
brought you this far. She gave you life, so that
you would become the Kazekage. She gave you friends. She gave you the bonds with
your siblings and community. All things that I took away from you. All I did as your father was
to torment you. I don't deserve to be called
your father. My mother was wonderful indeed. Thanks to her, for the first time,
I received medicine from my father. Gaara… You… SEAL You surpassed me long ago. I leave the village to you, Gaara! Itachi Uchiha and Nagato?!

 You know these guys, Naruto?

 Yeah! Both of them!

 Never would I have thought
I'd have to battle you again, Naruto!

 You now command
the Power of the Nine Tails?

 I'm impressed with your development!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi"

 Naruto, I must ask you…

 CONTACT!
NARUTO VS. ITACHI

 Tune in again!

 They've been making us walk
quite a distance since sunrise. Our battle must be imminent. Who will we be fighting? You don't think it's… Are they close? It feels familiar, nostalgic… Itachi Uchiha…and Nagato! You know these guys, Naruto? Yeah, I know both of them. I never imagined I'd be forced
into fighting you again, Naruto. It's probably been
a while since we last met. But since I've been dead, it feels
like it's only been a moment. You've changed a bit, Naruto. Oh, you mean this? I'm in control of
the Nine Tails' chakra now. This is my Chakra Mode! What? I see…
No wonder you look different. It's your face. You now command
the Power of the Nine Tails? I'm impressed with
your development! He and I are sibling students. I'm not surprised! For that, it's me he owes… Before I came along, he was
pretty much in the shadows. That's so not true! So you've overcome hatred, Naruto? Oh yeah! As my senior,
you taught me about pain. The training I did at the Waterfall
of Truth with Octopops… My mom and dad… I have all of you to thank
for where I am now! I see… Naruto, I must ask you… That reminds me— I have a question for you,
as well. Seems like I found you first…
Eight Tails and Nine Tails. With these two cards,
he'll fall right into my hands. Too bad I won't be able to see
the frustrated look on his face under that mask…
when he realizes! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi!

 Naruto, I must ask you… That reminds me— I have a question for you, as well. Yo?! Oops, was that hot? Sorry for not giving it all I got. Samehada… So Kisame is… He was still talking… He's under a spell… Even if he cuts you off,
what the hell? Okay? Above you! I see him! What happened to Sasuke? He says he's going to take
revenge on the Leaf Village! He joined the Akatsuki! Why won't Sasuke return
to the village? He found out about
your top-secret mission, and chose to destroy the village! Top-secret mission? Don't tell me Madara…? Madara told me the truth too. So that's how it was… So Madara was telling the truth! The Uchiha Clan tried to
take over the village and… You've said enough, Naruto. Is that true, Itachi? Itachi… You died playing the villain in order to protect
the village and Sasuke! Sasuke surely understands
your pain and resolve! But instead of seeing
your wishes through, Sasuke is trying to
destroy the village. This is his way of avenging the pain the village caused
his beloved older brother! Damn Madara,
he knew the truth about me… Do the villagers know about this? Kakashi Sensei and
Captain Yamato were there too. But there was nothing to prove
what Madara said, so Kakashi Sensei is keeping
everyone tight-lipped. I don't think anyone else knows. Then don't ever tell
the village about this! You can't let the Uchiha Clan's
reputation change! And one more thing… Damn! My body is moving
on its own! Universal Pull! Nicely dodged, Naruto! I'm stronger now than
when Pain and I fought. I'll let you deal with Sasuke. That was my plan from the start! Entrusting it to you was
the right thing to do, after all. Okay, Naruto, pull me away! I can't move by myself. Summoning Jutsu! What?! Or maybe I can… Did you always do that? Behind you! I got it! Okay! Fire Style! Phoenix Flower Jutsu! Hot! Hot! Hot! Caught you! Ya fool, ya fool! For someone so big,
that was easy! Keep your guard up, Naruto! What the hell's happening?! Genjutsu! Don't look at my eyes! Ouch! Wake up! Samehada! Killer Bee the Eight Tails!
That's me! Yay! This'll go on forever! He multiplies every time
you hit him! Knock me down first! Watch yourself, Octopops! If you get struck by Amaterasu or
Tsukuyomi, it'll be the end of you! He's got the Mangekyo Sharingan! It's out. Did he do something to Naruto
with his Visual Prowess? Why did a crow
come out of my mouth? Why are you so attached
to my brother? He's a Rogue Ninja. That's because unlike you… I think of him as a brother,
more than you ever did. You're already under my genjutsu. Damn it! I'll say it again. I just wanted to talk to you
for a moment. You've been trying to take
Sasuke back to the village. But what if it doesn't go
the way you want? I'll do anything to make it happen. Even by force? If, by some turn of luck, Sasuke goes with you
willingly, great. But what if the exact
opposite happens? What does that mean? You just said you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother… What if Sasuke were to attack
the Leaf Village? What would you do then? What?
Why would Sasuke…? There's no way he'd do
something like that! Sasuke is still naïve. He can easily be dyed any color. In such a case,
can you stop him? Even if you have to kill Sasuke? Come to think of it, back then… I have shared some of
my power with you. Though I hope the day never comes
when you'll have to use it. This feeling! Naruto! It's Amaterasu! Almighty Push! Damn it! My body's moving
by itself again! What was that?! What's going on?! It's not Amaterasu? So that's how it is… How what is…? Amaterasu… He used Amaterasu? That crow… It's yours, isn't it? What did you do with that crow? I underestimated him… Itachi Uchiha.
He's clearly different from the rest. He resisted my Reanimation Jutsu. It worked… Oh, so that's it… Amaterasu! You! Relax… I'm no longer being controlled. I used a new genjutsu against
the enemy's jutsu. A genjutsu that orders me
to protect the Leaf Village. It erased the Reanimation Jutsu. I prepared that crow to respond
to my Mangekyo Sharingan. Just in case, for times like this. What're you talking about? It's implanted in that crow's left eye. It's his eye! There's only one genjutsu
that can do that. Shisui Uchiha's… The ultimate Mangekyo Sharingan
genjutsu in existence: Koto Amatsukami. Using that genjutsu,
I was able to restore myself. It appears Shisui's Mangekyo
had already worn off, though. Shisui Uchiha? The Uchiha's most powerful
genjutsu user…. Shisui the Teleporter? Shisui's Visual Prowess creates
a powerful genjutsu that allows you to control someone
without them ever realizing it. I programmed the genjutsu,
to protect the Leaf, into Shisui's eye. Then I put it into the crow's left eye, and after that,
I gave the crow to you, Naruto. I never realized that I'd be
using it on myself someday. Why did you have that eye,
and why did you give it to me? Self-sacrifice… The mark of a true shinobi is
that they do not seek glory. They protect from the shadows. Shisui taught me that. Shisui anticipated that a battle
would ensue for his eyes. He faked his own death and made it seem like
his eyes were destroyed. I helped him by becoming
the target of suspicion in the village. When I last saw Shisui, Danzo had managed to
steal his right eye. He bequeathed his remaining
left eye to me, telling me to use it to protect
the village, and disappeared. I gave that eye to you,
because you share Shisui's feelings. If Sasuke, whom I left behind, ever became a threat
to the village… then I would have violated all
that Shisui entrusted me to do. You are the only one
who can make it right. You said you consider
Sasuke a brother. That's why I felt that you, Naruto, were the only one
who could stop him. True power… In his quest for
the Eternal Mangekyo, Sasuke planned on transplanting
my eyes into himself. If that ever happened, that crow was supposed
to emerge from you, in response to your coming into
contact with my transplanted eyes, and cast the Koto Amatsukami
to protect the Leaf, onto Sasuke. That was my plan. Why didn't you cast that jutsu
on Sasuke from the start, using Shisui's eye? It's not that I didn't, I couldn't. Not at that time… Shisui's Mangekyo would take
decades to reactivate, unless you had
Hashirama Senju's chakra. Also, there were many things Sasuke wanted to
use my death for. Itachi… Thank you for trusting me. You don't have to worry anymore. You've done more than
enough for the village. Let me take care of the rest. I would defend the Leaf Village! But I would also stop
Sasuke without killing him! My little brother is lucky…
to have a friend like you. Even Shisui's eye… Luck just keeps coming my way! Almighty Push! Where did he go?! Almighty Push! It isn't going to be that easy.
Fool, ya fool! Lariat! Gakido! Are you absorbing chakra? Octopops, you okay? Ningendo! What… …is this?! Planetary Devastation!
He got me with this jutsu once!

 It's super bad ya' know!

 If you get caught in it, it's over!

 Hey, Naruto, if it's a sure death,
how come you're still alive?

 In that case, we'll be all right!
We'll get through this fight!

 Hey! This is no time to be laughing!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Acknowledged One"

 THE ACKNOWLEDGED ONE

Every jutsu has
a weakness! THE ACKNOWLEDGED ONE Tune in again! What jutsu is this anyway?! A jutsu that pulls…
A jutsu that repels… A Summoning Jutsu… A jutsu that absorbs ninjutsu! You have all of Pain's jutsu! But I'm…not familiar with this one! Oh, right! I just confirmed that he can absorb
ninjutsu a minute ago! Stupid me! Nagato! What the hell is
that jutsu anyway?! Tell me! No good! He's completely being controlled… Jigokudo! Hey, wait… This is… It's the reviver Pain's jutsu! What are you after?! Use Ningendo to extract
their soul and kill them off. Hide their bodies and souls
with Jigokudo… and bring them back to me,
so that I can revive them. I can make the Jinchuriki mine
without Madara finding out. Now then, what else could he do? Damn it! So you're not gonna
give me any answers, after all?! How does that reviving jutsu work again? This stuff…
It's like my soul's coming out! And I'm losing strength… I'm getting a bad feeling about this! The Acknowledged One

 Shurado! What did he summon? A fancy armor? Octopops! He sure uses a lot of hands.
To change tactics and his stance. Naruto, remember when you had
that tug-of-war with the Nine Tails! Susano'o! Itachi! So this is the Susano'o!
Man, what a show! You're a lifesaver! Thanks, Itachi! What kind of ninja is he?! Damn, he's strong! Fool, ya fool! He's known as Pain, and has the strength of
the Sage of Six Paths. So, of course he's strong! And this time, we're facing him,
not his corpse puppets! So his power and moves are
in a different league. Oh yeah… We can still use that planet jutsu
to capture them… Planetary Devastation. Here it comes! What is that?! That black sphere looks like
it has enormous gravitational pull! He got me with this jutsu once! It's super bad, it's super bad! If you get caught in it, it's over! Hey, Naruto… What?! If it's a sure death,
how come you're still alive? Well then, no need to worry,
about our victory. This is no time to be laughing! How can you be so easygoing
when we're in a bind like this?! If we're caught,
we'll never be able to get out! Its gravitational power is awesome! I got out only because
of Nine Tails' rampage… It's not about being easygoing. Analysis requires calm. It's safe to assume that the mass
that Nagato threw earlier is the central core of gravity. We need to destroy it. We'll attack the center simultaneously, each of us using our most powerful
long-distance ninjutsu! We can't aim properly under
these conditions! Our jutsu will make contact,
even if we don't aim correctly. This tactic takes advantage of
the core's powerful gravitational pull. Every jutsu has a weakness! Okay. That was fast! All right… Me too! Yasaka Beads! Tailed Beast Bomb! Wind Style, Rasen Shuriken! Forgive me…Itachi. You're back. This is the Totsuka Blade… Do you think an attack
like this is going to stop me? This sword…
This is the Totsuka Blade! Itachi, you had this hidden
with you all along! What is that sword? It's the Totsuka Blade.
Also known as the Sakegari Blade. It seals away all it pierces,
into a world of eternal genjutsu. The blade itself is imbued
with a sealing jutsu and is a variant of the Kusanagi Blade. It's a sword that possesses
a sealing jutsu. You will be sealed away soon. Do you have any last words? Naruto, I will return to our master's side
and watch your story unfold. If you ask me, you are
the final volume of the trilogy. Jiraiya was the perfect first volume. But the second volume
was a failure…me. One that our master
would not acknowledge. The series will culminate with
the third and final volume. You must make it
a masterpiece… One that will completely overshadow
the failure of the middle volume, Naruto! Farewell. Damn Nagato…
He wasn't mobile enough! I hoped to compensate his lack of mobility
with the summoned Rinnegan, which would give him
the same field of vision. But Itachi was able to target it with
his kunai even from his blind spots. That's his shuriken jutsu. Even Nagato couldn't dodge it. I have no choice,
but to bring out my special reserve! This Reanimation Jutsu or
whatever they call it stinks! Guys are forced to fight,
even when they don't want to. This is happening at
other battlegrounds too, right? I will put a stop to
the Reanimation Jutsu. I leave Madara to you two. We fought with a Reanimated Ninja
on the way here. The Sand shinobi sealed him… But it seems he can't be killed, okay? This is a perfect jutsu that
has no weaknesses, okay? I told you earlier. There is a weakness in every jutsu. I wonder about that… No, I'll stop him! Like I said…
Leave the rest to me! Shadow Clone Jutsu! You've used Nine Tails
Chakra Mode too much. No more clones right now, Naruto! Don't try to do everything yourself. I am the best one to put
an end to the Reanimation Jutsu. I also have an idea. I'll put an end to this war… It's my responsibility! I'll admit that you're stronger
than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight
of what's truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village,
who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It's because you fought hard
for their acceptance. You once said it was
everyone who cares about you who helped you get
where you are now. If you forget others because
you now have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you'll eventually become
just like Madara. No matter how powerful
you become, do not try to shoulder
everything alone. If you do, you will surely fail. Your father, Minato, was able to
fulfill his duty as the Hokage because he had your mother, Kushina,
and his comrades at his side. You share your father's dream,
don't you? Then don't ever forget… Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean
people will acknowledge you. But when the people
acknowledge you, you can become the Hokage. Never forget your friends! Naruto… I swore to that Iruka fella.
Simply put, that I'd protect ya. I won't let you go alone, bro!
Cuz' I'm still alive, and rarin' to go. Don't act like a spoiled brat! To me, you are… To me, you are… An important student. And…I think of you as
my little brother. The enemy leader is targeting you
with everything he's got. How can we allow you
to face such danger? And besides, there is no reason for you
to shoulder that burden alone. You're right. I forgot. I thought I had to do it all alone. W-Why?! Shisui's eye won't work for
another decade or so. You won't be able to use it against Sasuke. But you possess something
far greater than Shisui's eye. You have the same soul as Shisui. That is what Shisui really
wanted to pass on. You don't need his eye anymore. As you are now, you can stop Sasuke without
something like this. You can stand
before Sasuke now. This time, you can… No. I tried to do everything myself
and I failed. This time, I will leave it
to my comrades. I leave Sasuke to you. You're not just a powerful shinobi. Killer Bee…
Take care of Naruto. For sure! Itachi! Let's go, Octopops! Hey! Don't underestimate my jutsu!

 You really should stand back!

 Here are my weaknesses! For real!

 I'm a Shadow Style user,
and my summoning creature is…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Mizukage, the Giant Clam, and the Mirage"

 My summoning creature is…
a giant clam!

 THE MIZUKAGE, THE GIANT CLAM,
AND THE MIRAGE

 Tune in again!

<i>What is...that...?</i> <i>That's...what Master Jiraiya
<i>was talking about...</i> <i>The Nine-Tail's Cloak...huh...?</i> <i>So that's the Jinchuriki's...</i> <i>No wonder...
<i>his punches were so hard...</i> It's so hot...! <i>Listen carefully, Kakashi.</i> At some point... the Nine-Tail's Chakra may
leak out of Naruto's body... and take the form
of the Fox Spirit. The Chakra will turn
into the Fox Spirit?! You can refer to it as
the Nine-Tail's Cloak. The Nine-Tail's Cloak...? If the Nine-Tail's Cloak appears,
you must be careful! Listen carefully... You must stop it while
there's still only one tail... If you don't... you'll end up seeing
something frightening... <i>Aesthetics of an Instant


</i> Right from the start... Calm down, Naruto! <i>He's lost his ability
<i>to think calmly and rationally.</i> <i>It's dangerous to
<i>approach him carelessly...</i> <i>If the need arises...use this.</i> <i>With this, you can immediately suppress
<i>the Chakra.</i> I'm saved... Have you calmed down, Naruto? <i>What in the world
<i>did Master Jiraiya see?</i> <i>I got to see something pretty cool.</i> <i>Someone's...coming...</i> We finally meet up. S-Sakura... You did well to find us here. We felt a huge tremor earlier... You guys...did it, huh? Yeah... It looks like you're still...
having some trouble here... Unfortunately... What happened with Gaara...? All right... <i>Don't tell me...</i> <i>I can't believe my man Sasori</i> <i>got beaten by a little girl
<i>and that old hag...</i> <i>Eternal beauty that remains long
<i>into the future, my butt.</i> <i>He goes and dies just like that...</i> <i>He was too confident in that form
<i>with its weakness in full view!</i> <i>Well, from my standpoint,</i> <i>it was an ending befitting of an artist.</i> Good work, Neji. Good work, Neji! I haven't worked at all. I see... That must be the Byakugan
that's passed down through the Leaf... along with the Sharingan. You used those eyes to approach me
from my blind spot, huh...? It's the first time
I've seen the real deal... I'd like to see how it's different
from Itachi's Sharingan. But I think escaping from
this situation comes first now. Heh! Now that Team Guy,
the strongest in all the Leaf is here... you can't escape! Exactly! Prepare yourself! Team Guy, huh? <i>Not bad.</i> Severe Leaf Hurricane! <i>Looks like it's impossible
<i>to get away by foot...</i> Here I go! 8 Trigrams! Air Palm! <i>These guys are sure pesky...!</i> <i>I'm sure it's around here...</i> <i>Down there, huh?!</i> He went down! We don't know what he's planning. Don't lower your guard! - Roger!
- Roger! Be careful, everyone! He's a long-range type
who uses explosives! I'll show you my ultimate work of art... He's concentrating his Chakra
in one spot all at once! Don't tell me... Get back quickly, everyone! Art is explosive! We won't make it in time! What's going on?! <i>I somehow made it in time...</i> You okay, Kakashi Sensei? <i>I'd expect no less from my rival...</i> What in the world...
did you do? I blew the explosion...
into another dimension. Another dimension?! <i>This is...a Sharingan Vision Jutsu...</i> I don't really get what happened, but the enemy has
been defeated, right, Tenten? Hey! Don't ask me that. More importantly...
Is everyone okay? Sakura... Sakura... Why...? Why did...
Why is it always Gaara? Did he have to die like this...?! He's the Kazekage... He just became the Kazekage... Calm down, Naruto Uzumaki... Shut up! This wouldn't have happened if you Sand Shinobi hadn't put
a monster inside Gaara! Did you even ask Gaara at all
about how he felt?! Jinchuriki, my butt! You've no right to act
so self-important by labeling us... with that word <i>you</i>  created! Naruto... I can't save Sasuke... And I can't save...Gaara... I trained so hard for three years. Nothing's changed
since three years ago... Granny Chiyo...
That Jutsu will...! <i>Granny Chiyo...</i> Everything I've done until now
was wrong. However, it looks like I'll finally be able
to do something right at the end. The world of the Sand and the Leaf created
by foolish old people is finished. I'm sure the future you build
from here on out will be much different than ours. Next episode: "The Legacy" So they'll use these tags to seal us. All right!
Well done, young Kazekage! What? What's going on?! I'm totally ready to be sealed! Our bodies are programmed to
automatically counter an enemy's jutsu! Here they come! Surround those two! Particle Style… Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! You've aged, Ohnoki. Nonsense… You'd better get the Kazekage here
to use his sensory skills or you'll die, Ohnoki! The Mizukage, the Giant Clam
                   and the Mirage

 Hey! Don't underestimate my jutsu!
You really should stand back! For real! For real? Here are my weaknesses! For real! For real? For real. Now listen! I'm a Shadow Style user,
in other words, I use genjutsu. And my summoning is… a Giant Clam! I'm a Lightning User! Line up your Earth Style shinobi
and use them as a shield… and attack with
your Wind Style shinobi! Thanks for your thoughtfulness!
In fact, I'd like to know more! I have no control over my body! I can't waste any more time talking! Come! Wind and Earth Style shinobi,
follow me! Sealing Unit, keep up with us! That's right. Go away, Raikage. If you and I stick together,
these guys won't be able to seal us. So, do you have a strategy… Fifth Kazekage? I'm leaving you guys in charge here. Huh?! Commander! We have to deal with him
without you?! Hey, hey! What kind of tactic is that?! Didn't you hear me?!
I am a Shadow User! This Giant Clam can cast
a genjutsu over a wide area! It'll make you see illusions! A physical attack won't work! I'm talking about a mirage! I can tell.
You have no desire to kill. Of course not!
That's to be expected! I can't stand being manipulated
by some other jutsu user. That's why I want you to
seal me quickly, Kazekage! Hey! Deal with him. Hey! You can count on us! Hey, wispy whiskers! Wispy whiskers? Don't call me that! I don't care about
the Reanimation anymore. I'll kill you! He means it! Man, this is awkward. Let's go, guys! – Yeah!
– Right! Let's do it! – Yeah!
– Right! I'm counting on you…
Do something. Good! Now you look like you
mean business! Listen up, I'll tell you one more time! Attacking this me is useless! Your sensory skills are useless
against me. You shouldn't underestimate me. Stone Clone Jutsu! So you'll come at me in numbers…
That might work. Did we get him? No way! I told you attacking
this me is useless! This me is just a mirage! Then what do we have to do?! So, defeat my Giant Clam first! It's the one creating the mirage. But its shell is hard. Use large-scale weapons
or Paper Bombs! But… What? We just used them
with the last attack… Just hurry up and
retrieve the weapons! I'm sorry! Everyone, quickly! Hurry! Hey, that's mine. Where's my weapon? Hey! There are a lot of 'em
over that way too! What are you doing here?
Digging for clams? Pardon us. This is awkward… All right! Let's do it, everyone! – Right!
– Right! Target the Giant Clam! Take that! Did we get it? Huh? Damn it! I can't stand this anymore! – Why?!
– Why?! Hey! What's going on? Yeah. So I keep telling you
over and over again… That Giant Clam is also a mirage, idiots! Aim for the real one! Yeah, so tell us where the real one is! Like I said! Look around behind me! It's camouflaged within
a mirage and hiding! Aww, damn it! I told you attacking
this me is useless! Oh no, I was aiming for
the Giant Clam in the back. Like I said, that's a mirage, idiot! Aw man, I don't understand! I don't get it! – We don't get it!
– We don't get it! Look, you guys… Wispy whiskers! I'll kill you! He means it! – Who said that?! Apologize!
– Come out and apologize! Hurry! I'm sorry. This is awkward… What the heck!
Once more, an all-out attack! Let's go! Are you sure? Are you really sure
you want to do that?! Where did that come from?! Behind you, Tsuchikage! Not now! Particle Style! Atomic Dismantling Jutsu. Is that…?! Planet Rasengan! Is that…Naruto?! Damn it! Lord Mu is a Sensory Shinobi. Gaara! Sand! Using Sand as a springboard
for his attack? I see. Dodge this.
My jutsu is faster than yours! All right! This is…  a violently rotating… Rasengan! Earth Style… Boulder Jutsu! Now you're so heavy, you won't even be able to
raise your arms. Owww… You used to hate the other villages,
now you work so well with them. It's worth living a long life. You get to enjoy change. Don't let down your guard. I'm still… All right! Way to go, Gaara! Oh yeah…
Nice work too, Shorty Gramps! I am the Tsuchikage, you know. By the way— What are you doing
on the battlefield?! Why did you come?! Err… Well… Let me explain… You better have a good enough
explanation to persuade me! That would be impossible. So I will do the talking. This is Shikaku Nara at HQ. Both you and the Tsuchikage
were in the middle of fighting, so I thought I'd save
the complicated talk for later. Let's hear it then.
But the fighting is not over. We must head out immediately. You can brief us on the way. You know,
I'm not trying to win here. You're too strong for us. Yeah well…
Still, you must seal me. Otherwise, I'll remain a puppet… Okay, everyone, get up! Get up! So that's how it is, eh? I can't believe even
the Raikage relented. All right, I understand. I'm going to cease transmitting now. Naruto. I have nothing against going
from one battlefield to another to identify the enemy
using transformation. But as a former Jinchuriki,
I know… The Nine Tails' chakra… Are you sure you can handle
using it so frequently? I don't plan on dying
until I become the Hokage. Don't treat me like a kid just
because you're the Kazekage now. I'll take the right battlefront! Gaara and Gramps Tsuchikage,
take the left! Naruto, the Third Raikage is there! Got it! And our opponent is
the Second Mizukage, correct? The Genjutsu User… Yes… Ordinary methods
won't work against him. – Oh, man…
– Still? I keep telling you it's a mirage. Go retrieve them! I've had it. Hey, you there! Huh? You mean me? You're from the Hidden Mist,
aren't you? Aren't you familiar with my jutsu? I know little about you,
Lord Second. I mean, I only know about
the current Lord Fifth. The secretiveness of
the Hidden Mist is to blame for this. If I knew things would be like this, I would've left behind
a bigger legend! Not good… Hey, you there! Playtime is over!
Come at me seriously now! We have been serious! I have no control over my body.
It's casting jutsu on its own. Damn it! I can't stand this! It's my Water Balloon Jutsu. Defend yourselves! Commander Gaara! Huh? What took you so long?! I hope this time you'll seal me! I intend to. I'm looking forward to it. Commander! This is not the time to be
looking somewhere else! Hey… Is that all you got? I keep telling you my weaknesses,
yet every single one of you… You tell us, but you're still too strong! This is closer to oil than water. Even if I use Sand as a barrier,  it'll just seep in and
make it collapse. You went to tackle Mu first,
didn't you? You always want to go for
the stronger one first. That's what you call battle! And that's what we did. Isn't it obvious I'm the stronger one?! That guy looks like
a half-dead mummy. Am I right? True… I realize now
that appearances can deceive. You certainly are strong. Finally, you understand. Huh?! What do you mean
"appearances can be deceiving"?! But you've got wispy whis— Cut it out! I told you…
that this me is a mirage, created by the Giant Clam's
wide-range genjutsu. So physical attacks are useless! Find the Giant Clam quickly
and destroy it! Otherwise, this will never end… That's right. Your Sand… I like to let my actions
do the talking. Over there! So you were already searching
for it with your Sand. I wondered why you were just focused
on the defensive. Well, finally a worthy foe! Now hurry up and defeat me! I used too much chakra in
my fight against Lord Mu. I can't use the Particle Style now. Well, I have no choice. I have to smash it
into pieces myself! Earth Style! Stone Fist Jutsu! One problem… You've got to put your back
into it a bit more. A light punch won't work, Lil' Ohnoki. You're not using
the Particle Style… Have you run out of juice? I'm not that Lil' Ohnoki
you used to make fun of long ago! Earth Style… Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu! Not bad, Ohnoki! Uh-oh… I've done it now! The genjutsu is undone. Oh, my back! I always knew
you'd be Tsuchikage. But you're nothing more than
a geezer with a sore back right now! I'll admit that was a punch
with some power to it, but you overdid it and
strained your back! Anyway! Hurry up and run! I'm about to use
the Hozuki Clan's Water Gun Jutsu! I can't stop myself! No matter how many times we attack,
there's no effect!

 We haven't inflicted
any damage!

 We need an even more powerful
Wind Style user.

 I'm a pretty good
Wind Style user myself, you know.

 Honestly, among the Allied Forces,
there isn't a stronger Wind Style user.

 There is! It's me!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Paradox"

 PARADOX

Is it a new Rasengan?
Maybe with this jutsu… PARADOX


 Tune in again!

 Who are you aiming at? You're too fast for our attacks! I'll say it again. I am a Lightning Style User. When I arm myself with
the Lightning Style, my speed and defensive power exceed
the normal limits of my body. Unless you attack with
the Wind Style, you will never be able
to take me down. The trouble is,
we can't land a blow even with that! No, wait… Wind Style Unit!
Attack Formation C! Right! Here we go! Humph! Instead of doing it quietly, she announces how
they're going to attack. Group Wind Style Jutsu! Wind Style: Casting Net! A wide-range jutsu
to overtake my speed… Splendid! All right! We'll surround him
all at once! Paradox

 No matter how many times
we attack, there's no effect! We haven't inflicted any damage! Our only choice is to batter him
with consecutive top-speed Blade Dance! Is that you, Dodai? Yes. The Third Lord Raikage was a shinobi blessed not only with
strength and speed, but also with extraordinary
physical resilience. Even long-distance Wind Style attacks,
which should reach him, do not affect him. We need an even more
powerful Wind Style User. I'm a pretty good
Wind Style User myself. So how did he actually die? In order to save his comrades… He used himself as a decoy
and faced 10,000 enemy troops alone. It's said he stood for three days
and three nights in order to buy enough time to
let his comrades escape. I need this one to
buy me some time… while I finish summoning him. Guess I'll just have to take over. Honestly, among the Allied Forces, there isn't a stronger
Wind Style User than me. There is! It's me! What?! Is that Naruto?!
What is he doing here? That feels like Wind Style!
Is it a new Rasengan? With this jutsu,
it just might work if it hits! No! That's not good enough! Not with his Cloak of Lightning… I know! Raikage are
always super fast! That's what he was aiming for! It's no use!
He dodged it again! We have to distract him,
or it won't hit him! Okay! When it comes back… At this distance… It's gonna hit! That Wind Style is strong! This will work… Now, Sealing Corps! Hurry! Right! All right! W-What?! Third Raikage… You are so strong,
it's frightening… I don't believe it. Rasen Shuriken didn't work?! The look in Lord Raikage's eyes
has changed… He's been completely taken over. That's…?! Everyone, get away from
the Third Raikage! Earth Style Shinobi,
form a wall immediately! Everyone, link up! – Right!
– Right! – Earth Style: Great Mud Wall!
– Earth Style: Great Mud Wall! Disperse! Come with me, Naruto! Lava Style: Rubber Wall! What the—?! That was the Third Raikage's
most lethal ninjutsu… The Piercing Four-Fingered
Thrust of Hell! He accumulates Lightning Chakra
in his fingertip and strikes… This thrust technique complements
the Lightning Style. Just like Kakashi Sensei's Lightning Blade
and Sasuke's Chidori. Everyone, get as far away
as possible, now! No! If we know where he'll appear,
we should aim for that spot all together! Everyone, stand by! It's payback time for all
the times we missed! Stop! Listen to the Cloud Shinobi! Get him! Damn it! Fools! He's switched to
the Three-Fingered Assault! What kind of jutsu is it anyway? It's way too powerful! He took dozens down in
an instant, all by himself! The fewer the fingers he uses,
the more focused the energy and the more powerful the Thrusts of Hell! It's the Third's Invincible Spear! And he can handle it with
his impermeable body. It's his ultimate shield! Is that old man even human…? They say he is the only shinobi
to have ever been able to go head to head with a Tailed Beast,
unarmored and unarmed! No way! Raikage are amazing! Huh? What's the matter? So what's up with that? With what? Look at that…
The scar on his chest! If his body's the ultimate shield,
how'd he get that? He didn't even flinch against
my Rasen Shuriken! Oh, that… Once, the Third Raikage helped everyone
get away from the Eight Tails by stopping its rampage
all by himself. Then the Eight Tails hurt him? He called that the most
shameful incident of his life. One that he never spoke about… Not even the Fourth Raikage knows. Okay, I get that ordinary attacks
won't hurt him. But if he got hurt fighting
the Eight Tails, then the Eight Tails' strongest jutsu is… Speaking of the Eight Tails…! Tailed Beast Bomb! What'll we do, Lady Temari?! Even that hero, Naruto, couldn't
take him down… Huh?! Naruto? You mean the hero of
the Hidden Leaf? Where? Where?
Which one is he? Where were you looking, Yukata?! He's the one who just released
that flashy Wind Style Jutsu! Huh?! But that guy's about
the same age as us! Yes! At his age, he managed
to defeat Pain of the Akatsuki! So how can we beat an enemy that
even the hero of the Hidden Leaf can't? That's what I'm trying to
figure out right now! You two can't use
long-distance Wind Style! So go away, it's dangerous! – R-Right!
– R-Right! So what'll we do? Even Naruto's Rasengan couldn't
inflict serious damage. How do we fight the Raikage? We have to consider retreating. What a nuisance these Kage are…
even one who's by himself. This is the ideal time since
they're separated. If we retreat and allow him to join up
with the other Kage, it will get worse. What to do? What to do? W-What's this I'm feeling? Is Naruto trying another jutsu
or something? Th-This is the Tailed Beast Bomb…
The same as the Eight Tails'! He's holding a mass of chakra
this heavy in his human form?! Is this even possible? I figured it was impossible. What?! What happened?! Damn it! It still didn't work! His cloak of chakra is gone. He overdid it… Lady Temari! The enemy has broken through
our ranks! Many are hurt! Everyone, hurry and gather the wounded! Notify the Medical Team! Tell all to maintain
a standby position at a distance—! Are you all right?! Hey, hang on! Hey, Bendy Guy! I need to get a hold of Octopops
and Eight Tails right away! How do I reach them?! Go through the Com Corps and have Intel Unit Captain Inoichi
Yamanaka connect you with Bee. I just have to look for
a Com Corps Shinobi, huh? You're in luck. Huh?! I'm with the Com Corps. All right! Naruto! Watch out! He's withdrawn
his Three-Fingered Assault! He's aiming for a KO with a punch. Lava Style: Rubber Sphere! Lord Dodai of the Hidden Cloud!
What do you need? Naruto needs to speak to
Bee and Eight Tails. Please contact them immediately! While the Third Raikage is still chasing
after the dummy Rubber Ball! He made it look like
he had me inside that ball, but he pulled me out and
hid me behind a boulder! Bendy Guy thinks fast! Thanks, Bendy Guy! Now I'll have time to talk
to Octopops! He'll probably catch on right away! Remember, you don't have much time! Yeah! Naruto, you want to talk
to Bee and Eight Tails, but aren't they nearby? You're supposed to
be working together. They're not here now. Besides… Never mind, hurry and
contact them please! There's no time! Naruto's gone on ahead! Hurry up and finish your business! How long is it going to take?! The urge to go pee is
beyond one's control…y'see? Octopops, it's me, Naruto! I have to ask Eight Tails something! Put him on! Relieving oneself takes concentration.
So let me focus on urination. I can't talk now… I'm here, Naruto! What's going on? You seem to be in a panic! Hey, Eight Tails… You've fought the Third Raikage
before, right? Yeah, long ago. He was solid and
could take the blows. Once, he used this move called
the One-Fingered Assault and cut off all my tails. How did you manage to scar
Gramps Raikage on the chest? Huh?! Maybe it was my Tailed Beast Bomb? No, maybe it wasn't… We were pushing against
each other with all our might, and we both fell forward. I don't quite remember. Maybe… Hey thanks, Eight Tails! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What? Is this different
from the one earlier?! Gramps Raikage is headed this way. When he gets here,
get out of the way, Bendy Guy! There's something I want to try. Got it. Rasengan! Everyone! Do not assist! Sealing Corps! Stand by! Right! I don't know
what he's planning, but that's just a Rasengan! Is that going to be enough? His Invincible Spear will cut
through Naruto's arms and legs. I'll have him brought back
to me half-dead. Sage Mode: Frog Kumite! With this, I can sense danger
over a wider range, and it's faster! So I'll be able to counter
at the last minute… And aim straight for his arm! Just like I thought! I see… That's how he got
that scar on his chest! – We did it!
– We did it! All right! Way to go, Naruto! Yes! That was sharp of you! Eight Tails told me that they were
pushing as hard as they could, then fell forward. I figured that he must've fallen
on his own hand. He injured himself.
That's why it was so embarrassing. He was the shinobi with
the ultimate spear and shield… What a paradox. Lord Third's spear was stronger,
it seems… Yeah! Probably the shinobi with
the greatest shield is Gaara! I always knew you'd be Tsuchikage. But look at you now…
An old man riddled with back pain. I'll admit that was a punch
with some power to it… but you overdid it and
strained your back! Anyway! Hurry up and run! I'm about to use
the Hozuki Clan's Water Gun Jutsu! You were cooperative
until just now!

 What happened? Have you decided
to side with the enemy?

 I am a former Kage, after all.

 I am helping you out…
Just in a different way.

 Which is what exactly?

 If you can't win against me
using all of your abilities,

 that means you're less
than dead old me, you fool!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Terror: The Steam Imp"

 How are you gonna win against
the enemy boss like that?!

TERROR: THE STEAM IMP

 TERROR: THE STEAM IMP

 Tune in again!

 What did I tell you, idiot?! It's because you're way
too old for this! Oww… Thanks, Kazekage! An Eye of Sand… So he used that to keep
an eye on Ohnoki all this time! When he got the Giant Clam, he switched out with
a Sand Clone, eh? Oww… This one's gonna be big… And he doesn't have eyebrows. Okay! We got him! No, it didn't work! The slime is making the Sand
not stick together! This is bad!
I'm starting to enjoy this fight! Grand Sand Mausoleum! Now! Throw every Sealing Tag
you've got! There's no way his slime can
keep up with this much Sand. Attach the Sealing Chains! SEAL Good! We have this one! Wha—?! Th-This can't be…! What the hell is that?! Is it another genjutsu? Is it a genjutsu? No… It's not a genjutsu! That gave my predecessor
Lord Mu some trouble! It's the Infinite Explosion Ninjutsu
of the Mizukage! The Steam Imp! Terror: The Steam Imp

 Hail? Air forced upwards by
the steam explosion gets cooled in the upper atmosphere
and turns into hail! It shrank! What's this? He's a clone made from
oil and water taken from inside
the Mizukage's body. WATER       OIL

The exterior surface of
its child-like form is composed of oil, WATER       OIL


while its interior is just water. WATER       OIL

Its special feature is that it can
both heat up and cool down easily. When it moves around, STEAM       OIL


WATER      
the oil on its surface
heats up precipitously, STEAM       OIL


WATER      
causing rapid vaporization
of the water inside, resulting in an explosion of steam! And when the hail cools it, it shrinks back down to its original size
and it is ready to explode again. It's coming! He's faster than I expected! Are you all right?! Damn it! This clone's a wily one! The real one should be
around here somewhere! Don't bother with the clone.
Look for the original! Another feature of
this jutsu is that it greatly weakens the caster
while they are using it! That brat, Ohnoki,
sure knows a lot! Mu must've told him. If it's not a Mirage Genjutsu,
and he can't make himself disappear… I should be able to sense him. The original is behind that rock! Damn, my back!
Of all times for it to go out! Oww… Oh! Found me? Before the hail stops… I will seal you! What's going on with him? He's getting bigger and bigger! It's like Lord Tsuchikage said. The more it moves, the faster the water heats up
and vaporizes. The hail has stopped too. There's going to be
another explosion of steam soon! We've trapped the original! SEAL Hey! Damn! Whoa… This is a perfect hiding place! I was once one of
the Five Kage too. As long as I have my oil,
your Sand is useless. Unless, of course,
you seal me real fast. Seems like it! Now! How are you going to take me down?! I was hoping you'd tell us. I'm done doing that. Sorry. You were cooperative until just now!
What happened? Have you decided to side
with the enemy? You're wrong. I am a former Kage, after all. I am helping you out…
just in a different way. Which is what exactly? If you can't win against me
using all of your abilities, that means you're less
than dead old me, you fool! How are you gonna win against
the enemy boss like that?! I think he's about to explode! Retreat! Just when I thought I'd found
the Golden Child of the Five Kage… Kazekage! You're just
an ordinary kid, after all! Over there! Hold on! I'm coming! This is…the Sand Shield?! Lord Kazekage protected us! But where's Lord Gaara?! You protected everyone and
attacked at the same time, knowing full well
you'd sustain damage! Unless you stop this guy, the same thing is going
to keep happening! The hail has stopped…
Let's see what you've got! You mistimed getting your shield up
because of its sudden expansion! Another Sand Clone? That's within expectations… I knew it.
The real one was hiding below! What're you going to do?
It's going to explode again! You'll never catch him with
the speed of your Sand. What're you… Huh? What's happening? Did he increase the speed
of his Sand? Either way… Ka-boom! More smoke! They've got to be there! It stopped moving! Is that…? Gold! Did he mix that Gold Dust
his father left behind and do something to it? I hid Gold Dust in
that Sand Clone earlier. I took advantage of
that thing's heat to melt the gold
and bond it to him. Gold is about 20 times
heavier than water. Which is why its movements
have slowed down. That's why it was so easy
to trap it with the Sand! Still, why didn't it explode? Sand mixed with the hail was
more than enough to cool him down. Gold also has good conductivity,
which helped chill its steam. Well played. Truly befitting
a current Kage! I'm impressed that you came up
with such a strategy! Wait a minute… You really are… the Golden Child, after all! I never expected to be
at such a disadvantage. Still, I'm glad that clone was sealed
before he could say too much. Given Naruto and his power… Even if it's a Reanimated body,
it will take some time to regenerate. How naïve, Ohnoki… You were my student. How could you miss that
I had fragmented myself? This is… a violently rotating…
Rasengan! Earth Style! Boulder Jutsu! Be careful, I'm… All right! SEAL


 SEAL

As I thought,
I can't get this tag off. It's an impressive Sealing Jutsu. If I remember correctly, Mu's jutsu is not cloning,
but fission. Because the real body
simply splits into two, he doesn't need to make signs
and it's faster. However, his power is halved. Summoning him will take time
in this one's weakened state. I must buy time with another tactic… Are you all right, Gaara?! What about you? We sealed the Raikage! I saw an explosion, so I rushed here ahead
of Temari and the others. I see! I'm almost done here too. So, where's your enemy? Hey, so you have a friend! Huh? W-What is this guy?! Man, what a weird body! No, that's my jutsu. Kazekage… Unlike you, he seems like an idiot! You make a good pair. Really? It's been a while since
I had this much fun! SEAL Relay our current battle status
to HQ! Yes, sir! You fought well against
the former Kage, everyone! Victory is ours for this battle! All right! Extract the injured and transport them
to the Medical Corps! Those who can still fight will
stand by for orders from HQ! Lord Tsuchikage, you should go
to the Medical Corps, too. I'm fine now. Owww… Don't overdo it, old man. Don't treat me like an old man! I can still take
you young ones on— Okay, come on. Let us take you to
the Medical Corps. Fool! Let me go! I can walk on my own! You should just admit
that you're old. How dare you!
I am the Tsuchikage! Yes, I heard that yesterday too. Lord Gaara, please come by later. Let go, I said!
Didn't you hear me? We're going this way! Owww! Please stop moving around!
We're going. Naruto, you're a clone, right? Yeah… Then where's your original now? We are not taking in
any more patients. We just received orders to focus on the wounded
we have here already. But they keep bringing in
wounded from the battlefront. There's no way for us
to distinguish who is an ally and
who is the enemy in disguise. But that's… Even our chakra is
being copied perfectly. I might as well just consider
everyone besides me the enemy. Man, what a drag! But we have to figure something out. Where did they hide
the Bashosen anyway? It would be so handy! Any sign of the White Zetsu? No. But he could be disguised
as anyone. Please be careful, Lady Hinata. Yes… You as well, Neji. It still blurs… The Sealing Corps just reported in. They failed to seal
Pakura and Gari. I see… Two remain from
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen… Fuguki Suikazan and Mangetsu Hozuki. Everyone, wait for me! We get to play with you again!

 We aren't just simple Reanimations,
you know.

 Our Curse Mark's power
has been intensified

 to a level more than
when we were alive!

 You strategy-loving idiot!

 Tayuya, girls should speak properly.

 Shut up, fatso!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ghosts from the Past"

 It's game over for you! GHOSTS FROM THE PAST


 Tune in again!

 Captain Darui! I'll take over the watch. Please get some rest! Maybe I will. Black Panther! Captain…Darui? Man… It's enough to make
a guy doubt people… when fakes keep attacking
like this. S-Sorry. We've pretty much taken care
of all the enemy on the beach, so let's withdraw to the hills. Y-Yes, sir… This is more dull than fighting
with my predecessors. This is risky… What's wrong, Shikamaru? Zetsu's powers have destabilized
the entire Allied Force. You're referring to being unable
to trust each other, right? That's terrible. Sometimes mental exhaustion
is worse than physical. How can we go about
easing everyone's suspicions? Maybe by confirming identities
by using secrets only the other person
would know? Get real… We can't do that with
so many people. But… Fortunately, Headquarters has a strategy
for identifying transformed fakes. Headquarters has a strategy? Okay, you had me worried there. The problem is, it'll take time
to implement HQ's strategy. We need a plan to
hold out until then. Gentle Fist! Neji! This is… Yeah, I know! We get to play with you again! And we won't hold back this time! Haven't seen you in a while,
you gloomy piece of crap. Tayuya…
Girls should speak properly. Shut up, fatso! It's them… I'm going to give you
your first assignment. We pursued the group that
abducted Sasuke with a hastily assembled squad. We were prepared to lose
a man for every enemy we killed… Kidomaru of the East Gate. Sakon of the West Gate. Jirobo of the South Gate. Tayuya of the North Gate. The Sound Ninja Four. Damn. Trouble's come back to haunt us. Choji, can you come? Yeah! W-Wait! We'll fight together— No! If the fakes infiltrate us
during the chaos of battle, it could break up the entire unit. That's why Choji and I
will stop those four! We know those guys
better than anyone. Right… But let me make this clear! Even if it looks like us,
if it moves, it's an enemy! Attack without mercy. But…! Isn't that right, Captain Darui? Just as I would expect
of Shikaku's son. I think you're making the right call. Sorry to have to keep
relying on you, but take care of the matter
as you outlined. Ghosts from the Past

 W-What are these threads?
I can't break them! You saved my life… Withdraw from the area! Indiscriminate killings… Neji! This method of attack, it's… I see it. It's a special thread created
by mixing chakra with a unique bodily secretion. No doubt about it. This thread can't be cut
by anything except the Gentle Fist! Lady Hinata, take some
Gentle Fist users with you and rescue our men! Understood! What about you, Neji? I'm going to take down the one
controlling these threads from the shadows. Right! Multiple Legs Barrage! What took you so long? Look who's talking? How many years has it
been already? Not that I was waiting
or anything, though. Human Boulder! I'll finish you this time! You never give up, do you? Did you know? One person in every five
is always a little behind. That one gets treated like a fool. When push comes to shove,
he's the first to be sacrificed. I'm talking about you. Die…you pathetic fat outcast. If I hadn't taken the secret Food Pill, I'd have been killed
for sure back there. Did you go on a diet
or something? This is so unlike you! Take this! He doesn't attack needlessly. And he gathers information
from the results of his attacks. On top of that, he knows about
the only weakness in my eyes. As I expected, he's the strongest
enemy I've ever fought! Die! Fang Over Fang! Multi-Leg Hurricane! I'm getting used to
my dead body… You're taking too long!
Let's kill them and get this over with. Even though you're dead,
you haven't changed, Bro! Ouch! You bit me…
I must be a pretty lousy master. The bastard…
He's not even breaking a sweat. Don't underestimate us just
because your dog grew up. Akamaru! Wolf Fang Over Fang! Inuzuka Style!
Man Beast Team Transformation! Two-Headed Wolf! Let's go! Wolf Fang Over Fang! Still doing the same old thing. Do the Summoning Jutsu, Brother! Summoning Jutsu! – Rashomon!
– Rashomon! This one is dangerous. Take this! Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia! That was close! Is this genjutsu?! I can't move! Tayuya draws her victims into
her genjutsu with those strains. There are jonin capable of
countering genjutsu, but now that direct contact
between one another is forbidden, I can't rescue my comrades
who are under its control. Not good… Any closer,
and I'll become a victim, as well. You're in no position to be worrying
about others, you lowlife. She has a greater range of efficacy
than she had before— You've gotten nimble, fatso! It's game over for you, man! That's a special version designed
to protect Lord Orochimaru. If you hurt yourself
with your own power, it's no skin off my back. Let's finish him now, Sakon! Sure! We aren't just simple Reanimations,
you know, you strategy-loving idiot! Our Curse Mark's power
has been intensified to a level greater than
when we were alive! Not that you can hear me. Looking for me? Damn it! How come?! Huh? You were saying? What?! Your flute's annoying. But as long as I can't hear it,
it's okay, right? A simple trick. But no matter—! Huh? I can pretty much guess
what you want to say. You want to say you and
your friends are stronger now because of a Curse Mark
or some such, right? The problem is… I might have barely beaten him
using the secret Food Pill, but… Not knowing when to give up
hasn't changed, I see. "Hasn't changed"? No, that's not so. What?! Thanks for your help. Huh? Thanks to you,
I got a lot of practice with the Byakugan's blind spots
and range. Akamaru, sorry about that time. You had to be hospitalized,
all because I was too weak. Yeah, you bet! Let's show them
how strong we've become! You guys look down
on the living too much. Granted, you now have
immortal bodies and you're stronger than
when you were alive. But… we've been constantly fighting
against something way tougher. A rival called "the future." Ghosts from the past don't
even stand a chance. It's over for you… Shadow Stitching Jutsu! Partial Expansion Jutsu! 8 Trigrams Air Palm! Gentle Fist Chakra bundled
and then hurled. I never suspected
you had gained such a jutsu. Super Wolf Fang Over Fang! – No!
– No way! He did it! The Hidden Leaf defeated the enemy! Way to go! What is this? What are these fuzzy things
I'm sensing? It's unlike any "evil"
I've sensed before… This is…pure "hatred." The gloom of someone consumed
by feelings of revenge! Guys, stop! They're after something! – Transportation Jutsu Formula!
– Transportation Jutsu Formula! – Underworld Transfer!
– Underworld Transfer! Bastards! This is what you were after
from the start! Screw the future, lowlifes! Why don't you come
join us in Hell?! What the…?! Choji! Kiba! Neji! Shikamaru! What are we going to do, Shikamaru?
I need instructions!

 I'm going to have you all
move on my command!

 We're getting our old team
back together!

 The main goal of our plan of attack is
to return to the battlefield alive!

 – All right!
– All right!

 Naruto, you're included too.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Underworld Transfer Jutsu"

 Shikamaru, just hold on
a little bit longer!

 THE UNDERWORLD
TRANSFER JUTSU

 Tune in again!

 What just happened? You too? I thought we brought down
the enemy, but I think some kind
of jutsu activated. Yeah… He was barely breathing,
so I brought him this far. But because of
those white guys in disguise, the Medical Corps have stopped
taking in any more wounded. We can't do anything else for him… Neji! Wait! Don't come any closer! We can't tell if that's
a White Zetsu's Transformation Jutsu. What could have happened, Shino?! We probably fell into
the enemy's trap. We'll have to find
the enemy immediately and… You're not your usual self! Weren't we all using
our sensory powers, including Neji and Kiba? We must maintain calm if we are
to save those who can still be saved. First, Hinata, your eyes are crucial. Could you look at them?! Byakugan! What's going on? It's weak,
but I still sense chakra. But…the chakra is stopped. I see… It's weak, but there's a heartbeat. In other words, he's in
a state of suspended animation. Then we can save them? If the flow of chakra is stopped,
they won't last very long. But… So you two went off
on your own again… Kiba, Neji… This time, I'm not letting
you guys go on without me! What?! There's no chakra flow?! I'll get the Medical Corps right now! No! Whoever shows up could be
the enemy transformed to look like a Medical Corps member. Shikamaru would say
the same thing if he were conscious. But…! I'll do something about
these guys. What are you doing? I'm going to inundate them
with my own chakra and use the pressure to circulate
their internal chakra! That's ridiculous! You can't rotate the chakra
of two shinobi by yourself! But I have to do something! I'm the only one here
who knows Medical Ninjutsu. Why should I hesitate?! One wrong step and
you could die too… No one else can do it! Shino, what are you going to do?! My Parasitic Insects devour chakra. Chakra is like water. It flows towards wherever
there's empty space. Doing something like that will deplete
what little chakra they have left! Yes… But I'm going to let
the insects eat my chakra and transfer it to Kiba and the others. You can do something like that?! Leave it to me. Essentially, Parasitic Insects
don't have the trait that enables them to transfer chakra. But if I can successfully manipulate
each insect one by one… I have tens of thousands of insects. I'm not going to let the chakra flow stop
in Kiba and the others! But won't you use up
your own chakra? Don't worry about me! Don't worry about me! In the meantime,
get word to HQ… Have them figure out
a counterstrategy for us! Right! Right! We have to do
whatever we can! A jutsu that transports
only the soul into a barrier… The Underworld Transfer Jutsu. It seems to have worked nicely. Extracted souls are placed inside
a special barrier where they shall be reanimated. They won't be able
to escape from there. And they can fight without interference
from the living. However, the moment
their physical bodies die, their souls die as well. But those four who were resurrected
with Reanimation Jutsu had no physical bodies
to begin with. Inside this barrier,
they are invincible… They are immortal. This is going to be so interesting. The Underworld Transfer Jutsu

 What is this? What's going on? What happened? What are you and Choji
doing here, Shikamaru?! Never mind…
Where are we? Looks like you've been snared
by a nasty jutsu too. I guess so. Shikamaru! Look! The game's already gone
into the next stage. Damn it! And we had to lose just to keep those bastards
from getting away?! Damn, that pisses me off! Tayuya… Watch your language. Shut up, fatso! This is a special barrier… made especially to lock you guys up
and reanimate your souls. No one's going to come to save you,
and you can't escape. We're going to get our revenge
for that last time! A special barrier to reanimate souls? Souls? Hey! Don't tell me we're dead?! But I don't feel like I'm dead… How did we end up here
from the battlefield? Neji, can you take a look at
our chakra flow, and this barrier? Use your Byakugan. Got it! Byakugan! How is it, Neji? Everyone's chakra flow
seems to be intact. Which means we can probably
still use ninjutsu and taijutsu. However… I can't see anything beyond
the barrier. It's like there's a thick wall
in front of it. That's fine, Neji! As long as we're not dead, we can pulverize the jutsu user
of this stupid barrier and get out of here! We have to get back to
the battlefield as fast as we can! Looks like they're finally
ready to fight… And we're just about ready
on this side too. Let's get going! Damn it… I'm getting
a bad feeling about this. And… Shikamaru… Shikamaru… Shikamaru! Huh?! Are you all right?! Y-Yeah… It's going to be all right, Shikamaru. Something's not sitting right, huh? We'll handle the enemy,
so you go on and analyze it! Choji… If that's the case…
Let's do this, Akamaru! Spiky Human Boulder! All right! We're counting on you! Thanks. 8 Trigram 2 Palms! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! 64 Palms! Fang Over Fang! I can't keep relying on them. Now! You almost had him, Shikamaru! Damn! It's hard without Ino, after all… Imagine, you on the offense. I thought you'd leave
fatso behind again, but it looks like you found
your sense of duty. He's right about the last time. But it's different this time! We don't intend to lose
a man for every enemy we kill. Watch it, Choji! I made it in the knick of time! Thanks, Shikamaru! I owe you one. Shucks, I missed… You okay, Choji? Yeah, I was just caught off guard. But I'm good, thanks to Shikamaru. What's the enemy resistance like? Physical attacks are working. But… Their bodies don't die,
thanks to the Reanimation Jutsu! Give up already! There's no way you can beat immortals
like us, you piece of crap! Tayuya! Ladies should watch
what they say… Shut up, fatso! Hey, guys! Listen up. Remember what I said earlier… Don't even think about
risking your lives to break through
and finish the enemy. What do you mean? Are you saying
we can't fight them directly? No, it's not that. Just first and foremost, concentrate on getting
through this alive. I want to make one thing clear… I don't see any way of
beating these guys this time. That's… There are three reasons for this. One: These guys originally
possessed jonin strength, plus their bodies have
been reanimated. The risk is too great to
take them head-on. Two: There's no guarantee that beating these guys
will dissolve the barrier. But isn't that how it usually works? Like I said earlier,
these guys are dead. It doesn't matter to them
if a jutsu carries risks. He's probably right. So what do we do?! And there's the third reason… Men quietly whispering
amongst themselves is disgusting! That's enough!
Let's get started! – Sound Ninja Four: Summoning Jutsu!
– Sound Ninja Four: Summoning Jutsu! – Four Corner Beast Formation!
– Four Corner Beast Formation! We're surrounded. What'll we do, Shikamaru? What are our orders? First, let me ask you… The last time, we were prepared
to lose a man for every enemy we killed. As a result,
you guys were severely wounded. And you still want me to lead you? Huh? That was the best thing to do
at the time in order to get Sasuke. Kiba's right. Each of us decided on
one life for one enemy. If we got hurt, that was because
we weren't strong enough. That's all. Yeah! Don't let something
like that bother you! And besides,
we're not like the last time! We have more intel
on the enemy this time. And your analyses and decisions
have been spot on. You should know who makes
the best team captain in a situation like this! Am I wrong?! Next time, I'll get it perfect! And I swore back then that
I'd never whine again… I'm going to have you all move
on my command! We're using the same formation
as we did back then. The main goal of our plan is to go back to
the original battlefield alive! – Right!
– Right! Naruto, that includes you too! Hey, guys!
Where are you all headed?! To join up with the Second Company
to provide logistical support! Oh, that so! There're no more fakes
in this company. You've been a big help. Say, is there anyone in this company
who can transmit to HQ? Not here… But there should be someone
in southern encampment. Got it! Thanks! Hey! Shikamaru… Choji… Neji… Kiba… Just hold on a little bit longer! I'm sure HQ will come up
with a strategy! Not yet… I can't give up yet. It's because… such a thing
is unthinkable! Shino, we got word from HQ. Huh? That's all that's necessary? Basically, it's the same as thing
as releasing a genjutsu. If someone is able to touch
the stolen soul with chakra… the soul can come back
from the barrier. How is such a thing possible? You're doing it right now. This transmission is chakra itself that flows through our subconscious
and allows us to communicate. Then let's hurry and rescue them! There's nothing I'd like better.
However… Even HQ's system cannot pinpoint the exact location of Shikamaru
and the others. No doubt they're in
a special kind of barrier. Their souls are trapped inside. Unless I know where the barrier is,
I can't communicate with them. No way! There's no way to find a soul that's separated from
its physical body! Shino… You're just a fatso who relies on pills, and there's nowhere
for you to run! Shikamaru! Leave that one to me! Super Expansion Jutsu! So you can now grow without pills. I don't have enough chakra… I can't get any bigger. Choji! Think back to when
that guy caught you! So that puppet of mud has
the power to absorb chakra? I'll bash that guy,
so help me out! Huh? Hey! Only I can get that spider bastard! Shikamaru! How do I stop these guys
in their tracks? The stuff coming out of those
giants' mouths are Material Ghosts! They'll devour your chakra
with just a touch! And it's the jutsu user's flute
that manipulates them! I get it… With sound! Human Boulder! – The bastard!
– The bastard! Damn it! So you used your friends
as camouflage to expand! The Shadow Possession Jutsu complete! Now then…
How shall we cook you guys? This is my chance! Now, Neji! Damn it! We did it. Yeah, although barely. You're putting a lot of
wasted effort into this, aren't you?! It's to get back to the battlefield! Our efforts won't be wasted! I wonder about that. We're thrashing you with
our invincible mode. Nothing's more pathetic than
watching desperate weaklings like you! Suck it up a bit, will you?
Make our reanimation worthwhile. Still, it's a wasted effort. Let's reward them for trying
so hard, Sakon. Yeah. You deserve to know
a little secret about this barrier. Even if… That's even if
you had beaten us, this barrier still would
never have opened up. What?! No way… There's no way you can
win this game. To end this game, either you die here or
your physical bodies give out. In any case, it's not if you die,
but when you die! Damn! I'm starting to get a bad feeling… We are tools of war.

 We've been seeking vengeance
since the day we were born!

 Don't lump us into
the same category

 as those other damn Reanimations,
you pieces of crap!

 Hatred and resentment
liberate our strength!

 No one can stop us!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Vengeful"

 We're going to
tear you apart! THE VENGEFUL

 Tune in again!

 If only I knew where
their souls were located… I could save Neji and the others. Shino! Shino! You're an asset to our military strength!
We can't afford to lose you! Shino, please! I'm not giving up, Hinata. Shino… We're just a step away
from saving Neji and Kiba. If I give up, the flame of hope will be extinguished
before we even reach them. Giving up is easy. If the only way to save them
is to find their location, we can't give up.
We have to keep searching for them! I'm not giving up… Mister Shikaku! Did something happen to
Shikamaru and the others? All of a sudden,
I stopped sensing their chakra! Tell me if there's anything I can do! Say something! Shikaku… Connect me to Naruto. Naruto, can you hear me? Mister Shikaku! What's happening to Shikamaru
and the guys?! We know the jutsu
that they used. It's the Underworld Transfer Jutsu
that extracts the soul from the victim's body and places it inside a special barrier. Extracts the soul? But they're all still alive, right? Then find the location
of the souls and… That's impossible… There's no shinobi
who can locate souls. What can I do? Right now, you are the only shinobi who can mitigate the chaos
within the Allied Forces. No matter how immense
your chakra, there's no way you can
cover every battlefront. You're stretching yourself thin as it is. At this point,
the Allied Forces can't spare an important military asset
like you for just four shinobi. You idiot! They're not "just" shinobi! Shikamaru is your son! I heard how Shino and Ino are
desperately doing their best to save them! You're his father! How can you
turn your back on them?! As the strategist,
I must coordinate everyone's actions. I cannot allow people
to go off on their own. Your duty is to identify the enemy
by sensing their malice. You must do your absolute best. Give me a break! Naruto! Shikaku said to put every effort
into your mission. Do you understand? Roger on the mission! The Vengeful

 Give it up! Like I told you earlier,
we're immortal. And even if you do beat us,
this barrier won't come down. There's nothing you can do. What an idiot.
You're wide open! 8 Trigrams Air Palm! Fang Over Fang! Eat up his chakra so that he can never
get back on his feet! Now, Sakon! Shadow Pull Jutsu! That fool! What is he doing?! It worked! It's such a huge gate, I wondered what would happen
if it lost its foundation. It's dead on! Why you… You made us attack that area?! You were aiming for
that all along? Damn…you bastards! Cornered? Escape is impossible? As if all that would
make us give up. You're underestimating us,
you pieces of crap! No, you're underestimating us! I thought you were
much stronger last time. Hey, does that mean
that we've improved, since the dead don't? Sounds about right! You and your big mouth! Shikamaru… No need to rile up
the enemy like that. Besides, you Reanimations were
called back to be tools of war, right? So what's all this stupid stuff
about revenge? Why are you directing it at us? Didn't the Sand siblings kill you? Us? Tools of war? We have nothing to do
with this war! Our Reanimation is simply proof
of our loyalty to Lord Orochimaru… Lord Orochimaru kept
his promise to us, and this is the result. Now kill each other off. If you're not serious about it,
I shall kill you. The feeling that is born when
one gets past the fear of death… That's what I wanted. Look at those fine eyes. I shall bestow upon you
even greater power. And you shall do my bidding
as my favored ones. – Ninja Art! Four Flames Formation!
– Ninja Art! Four Flames Formation! We've witnessed various ninjutsu
at Lord Orochimaru's side. The ultimate is… The Reanimation. That old geezer… How dare he?! It seems like you want
to say something? No… In my current state,
you can kill me. This is the time to do it,
if you so wish. Well, I guess as long as
the Curse Mark binds you, you cannot point your blade at me. Although you failed,
you made yourselves useful in the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf. I shall reward you. What do you wish for? There is only one thing. Power… Power as a shinobi. We wish for nothing more. Fine… You are all amazing. I shall grant your wish. Kabuto, add them to the sample. I understand. A vengeful heart will draw out
the next level of power within you. An extreme desire for revenge
rapidly increases the power of the Curse Mark. What's the connection between
that and Reanimation? The emotions you four learned from overcoming the fear of death
at that laboratory… are bitterness and
hatred toward me. No, it was a much stronger emotion. I'm sure you swore
you would get back at me some day. Even if you were killed in the process. When you can hate
someone that much, when you are actually killed,
you take it with you… That hatred toward
the one who killed you. You die thinking that if
you could be resurrected, it would be to only seek revenge. Yes, through Reanimation, you will be resurrected as
ones who seek vengeance. And at that time, you will
attain power you never had before. And the source of the strength will be your consuming
desire for vengeance… Take full pleasure in
your newfound power. Today, as in the past,
we belong to Lord Orochimaru! We are Lord Orochimaru's
own vengeance seekers! Our hatred and our bitterness
toward you release our power. As it is now, no one can stop us. Don't lump us into
the same category as those other damn Reanimations,
you pieces of crap! Th-That's… Are you serious? You were reanimated just
to get revenge against us? You're crazy. If what they said is true… then they're just starting
to get serious… It's too soon… to faint! Even the Gentle Fist is nothing against my improved
Gum Style Spider Thread! I've always been better
at grappling than shooting. Wolf Fang Over Fang! Did we get him? Hey, you must be joking! As if that degree of power
will have any effect. Now, it's our turn! The power of this Curse Mark
is amazing! Super quick cell fusion and
cell division are possible! So being bound by shadows
means stuff like this is possible? You're too weak,
you pieces of crap! Show off… They've surpassed
the level of humans now. So did you get it out of your system? Don't act so complacent. The only reason
why you're not dead is because we're going
easy on you! I'm holding back
my irresistible urge to kill you! About that…
Let me go. Just let me go. You've got balls… My hatred just grew
a hundred times bigger. So you hate me that much? Yeah. Why are you provoking her so much? Choji… Do you remember
what we were talking about before we got here? Huh? Luckily, HQ has a strategy using a guy who can
see through the fakes. HQ has a strategy? Uh-huh… But what about it? The strategy is to
utilize Naruto's power. Seems the sensory power Naruto
obtained enables him to sense evil. They haven't notified
everyone about it yet. Naruto's heading to
each of the battlefields now with his Shadow Clones. Hey! Shikamaru! What are you rambling about?! Sorry. This is one time
I'm going by intuition. But I have a feeling it'll be soon. The third reason why
we don't need to fight directly… Knowing him, he's definitely
going to find this place. I'm just betting on that. – What?!
– What?! Mister Inoichi!
You were right! I went toward
a pitch-black aura of evil and there was a giant barrier! Leave the rest to us, Naruto! As long as we know
where they are, we can save Shikamaru
and the others! Right, Shikaku? Naruto, I'll leave you to deal
with the barrier. All right… I get it. You kept provoking them to make it possible for him
to sense their malice. You had faith that
Naruto would pick it up. Yeah! No doubt about it,
you guys are strong. But you made
the same mistake again. We aren't fighting alone. We have comrades
who rescued us when we were in
a difficult situation. That's why when
we're in a difficult situation now, we can have faith that
they'll come to help us! We know that
as long as we stand firm, there's always hope. That's the bond between comrades. That's what beat you guys! The last time…
and this time too! We haven't lost yet! You can't break or stop this power! It's impossible! Shikamaru! Yeah! Good, we're connected! Release! You're…! That brat from last time! Ridiculous! He tore apart the barrier
from the outside?! This is bad, Sakon. If the barrier is broken,
our souls will… Before that, let's get our revenge
on this guy at least! Nothing is born out of vengeance… Our…souls! The influence of the dead's desire
for revenge on the Curse Mark… Well, the data I collected
was worth it. I think pretty soon I'll be able to put him out
into the battlefield… And when that happens… all these opening acts
will mean nothing. This time, I was able to use
the enemy's evil intent to our advantage, but the malice of war
is spreading like wildfire… I have to put an end
to this quickly. Are you okay Neji?

 My eyes have
recovered considerably,

 but I still have
a lot of blind spots.

 Please rest assured.

 Until your eyes heal completely,
I'll protect you, Neji…

 The way you protected me
back then.

 When I protected you?

 This was back when Sasuke
was still in the village.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Heart's Eye"

 I've always wanted to tell you,
to let you know.

 THE HEART'S EYE

 Tune in again!

 Lady Hinata! Are you all right, Neji? My eyes have recovered
considerably, but I still have
a lot of blind spots. Please rest assured! Until your eyes heal completely,
I'll protect you, Neji. Like you protected me back then. I protected you? Lady Tsunade had just
become the Hokage… And Sasuke was
still in the village. HYUGA Lady Hinata… N-Neji… I will be your training partner. Huh? But this is the start
of Senbon Sparring. I'm aware of that. Senbon Sparring is an important ritual
of the main family. During the summer
of one's 13th year, one must drill daily until
a thousand spars are achieved. Then the head of the family takes over
as your sparring partner, and passes on secrets of the jutsu. That's why today,
Father and I… Lord Hiashi has gone away on
business regarding Lady Hanabi. Huh? The earliest he will return
will be a month from now. I was told to be your training partner. That's so… Are you dissatisfied with me? N-No… I didn't mean it that way… Let's begin. R-Right! One! Right! Two! Right! Next! Right! Ten! Right! 23! Right! 36! Right! 54! Right! HYUGA

 HYUGA

75! HYUGA

Right! 93! Hinata! Are you all right? I didn't hit that hard. I'm kind of bruised all over. What are all those bruises? Oh, I was training… Are you training that hard? I've been training with Neji
for a clan ritual. Is that so? It's tough growing up
in a noble family, huh? If you're training so hard,
I guess maybe you can't join us. You know about the fireworks display
this coming weekend? A fireworks display? Yes! To honor Lady Tsunade
on becoming the Fifth Hokage! I was thinking of going and
wanted to ask if you'd join me. Truth be told, I was planning to sneak Sasuke out
of the hospital, and go, just the two of us. But that guy insists on coming. Hey, Hinata! Naruto…? You know.
Unless there's a partner for him, I won't have any time alone
with Sasuke. A-A fireworks display with Naruto? Hey, Hinata!
Are you going to come or not! A-Absolutely. I'm coming… What's with her?
Did something happen? 838! What's the matter?! Your chakra flow is
all over the place! Sorry! You're too hung up on
each individual jutsu! And on jutsu accuracy. It makes no sense if
the overall flow is bad! Right! You respond,
but are you really listening? Your side! Elbow! I juggled my schedule around
to make time for you. I'm sorry, Neji… Stand up! Don't waste any more of my time. Yes! 839! Gentle Fist! 8 Trigrams!
2 Palm! 4 Palm! 8 Palm! 16 Palm! 32 Palm! 8 Trigrams! 64 Palms! Lady Hinata? Lady Hinata! Lady Hinata! The Heart's Eye It's eyestrain. Probably due to sudden and
excessive use of her eyes. Will she recover? Of course. The Byakugan is
not weak like that. With time, her eyes will recover
on their own. Don't you have any idea? I don't have a clue! Hey! Hey, Neji! Hi! Excuse me, Neji. Have you seen Hinata? I haven't seen her around
for a couple of days. You would know, right, Neji? I'm not Lady Hinata's bodyguard. We didn't say you were! We're just asking what's up
with Hinata! Am I obligated to answer
your questions? Oh yeah? Is that so?! Fine! Let's just go to Hinata's house, Sakura. Don't! Lady Hinata's recuperating! Recuperating? Did Hinata get hurt or something? She did tell me that you were helping her train
for a clan ritual… Don't tell me… Did you injure Hinata? It was due to Lady Hinata's lack of skill.
It wasn't my fault. You…! Naruto! You too, Neji.
That's no way to talk! That means she won't be able
to go to the fireworks display. Fireworks display? Huh? Don't you know? We're honoring Granny Tsunade
this weekend with a fireworks show. So anyhow, on that day… I'm going on
a date with Sakura—! Like I would go on a date with you! Hinata seemed really excited
about it. Ridiculous! Sheesh! He's so inconsiderate. Huh? Sakura? Huh? Hey, Sakura, wait up! What am I going to do with him? Sakura! HYUGA Is someone there? I guess I'm just imagining it. It's going to take more time. How much more time? Don't be impatient.
The main thing is that you rest. I see… Please wait, Doctor! That's Neji. Hide! Why are we hiding? It just seems like
the right thing to do. Lady Hinata's eyes must
heal by this weekend! Did Hinata injure her eyes? Lady Hinata was looking forward
to the fireworks display. I want her to go,
whatever it takes! Yes, but something like this is… If I only had some Eyebright… Eyebright? What is that? It's a rare medicinal plant and is said to be very effective
for eyestrain. Eyebright only grows
in secluded areas and is extremely difficult to find. That's right. I heard that someone saw it
in the Valley of Judgment. The Valley of Judgment… Hey, don't even think about
going to look for it. Even jonin get lost in
the Valley of Judgment. If you go,
you won't be able to return. If she rests quietly,
she will recover. She just needs to be patient
for a week or so. But one week is…! I figured you'd show up soon! Naruto… Sakura… You're going to
the Valley of Judgment, aren't you? So you do have a soft spot, Neji! We didn't mean
to eavesdrop, but… Right? Yeah, but we were right
in front of Hinata's house and happened to hear everything. We'll come with you to
get some Eyebright! No thanks! Do as you please! But don't expect me to help
if you lag behind! As if! Damn it! Sheesh! Do something about
that personality of yours! If you didn't go,
we would've gone anyway. I want Hinata to see
the pretty fireworks. I'm going to make her see, so that she can come and
keep Naruto out of my way! What is this place? This awful mist. Will we even be able to find
the medicinal plant in a place like this? Even jonin get lost in
the Valley of Judgment. You two stay here. Since you two don't have the Byakugan,
you'll just hinder me. Neji! Hey, what are you doing? Tying us up together so that
we don't get separated in the mist. It's our red string… of destiny! Why you…! Okay, Sakura! Let's go! Does that medicinal plant
really grow here? If I didn't have my Byakugan,
I couldn't even walk through here. Huh?! No way… This is supposed to be
a demilitarized zone. It must be someone very skilled
to move through the mist so freely. Or is it someone adept
with Visual Jutsu like the Byakugan or Sharingan? Naruto! Sakura! It's a nuisance!
This string is a pain in the butt! Hurry and cut it off, Naruto! I'm never gonna let them cut the red string
that ties us together, Sakura! Idiot, that's not what I meant! Oh no! 8 Palms! Rotation! Neji! You saved us! It's too soon to celebrate. There's even more
of the enemy now. No! The red string of destiny
that binds me to Sakura! Neji, damn you! Isn't destiny something you reach for
with your own hands? Huh? Naruto, you're the one
who told me that. Don't tell me you're putting
your faith on a piece of string? All right then! I'm going to reach for destiny
with my own hands! That destiny will never happen. Sakura, punch Naruto! Cha! Naruto! Put out your fist to the left! All right! It's the first time my fist
made contact with the enemy! I see… So that's it. I can't ward them off! Stop the fighting right there! Bushier Brow Sensei! Leaf! Hurricane Whirlwind! Lightning Blade! Kakashi Sensei! What are you two doing here? Huh? Surveillance. Surveillance? Well, it was a false alarm,
so I guess it's okay to tell you. It's said that a medicinal plant
that works well on eyestrain is found here in
the Valley of Judgment. That's why we're— And Orochimaru could be after it too. Did you say Orochimaru?! Where? Where the hell is he?! Like I said, it was a false alarm. Huh? Alarm? Idiot! False.
It was a false alarm. What they were worried
about didn't happen! Oh, is that all? You know that Orochimaru
is fixated on Visual Jutsu… especially the Sharingan. This medicinal plant would
be extremely helpful in Visual Jutsu research… This came up at our meeting, so Guy and I came here
for surveillance. And? What about you guys? Youth! Ah, this is what youth
is all about! Your passionate devotion
to your comrade! That is true friendship! I'm totally impressed with you! Bushier Brow Sensei… Your actions don't fit your words. Huh? Oh well, I guess we'll take our leave. But… Neji, you saw what
they looked like, didn't you? What do you mean? Oh… They didn't…have eyes. It's said that fish that live
in a world without light stop relying on sight,
and discard their eyes. How long do you think
it would take humans… to reach that point? A hundred years? A thousand? In any case, they adapted to
this valley and have thrived. They probably can't survive
outside this valley. You know whose valley this is,
don't you, Neji? Yes. Fighting a futile battle to obtain
medicine that will heal her eyes won't make Hinata happy at all. Back then,
before the fireworks show, Naruto and Sakura
came to tell me… what you went through
to try to help me. So you knew. I've always wanted to say this. I've wanted to tell you… Thank you, Neji! Okay, let's go, Neji! Compared to the Senbon Sparring,
this is nothing! Sounds good! Show me just how much
you have progressed since then! Until Naruto comes, we'll do everything we can
to protect this place. You're Kabuto Yakushi.

 Are you still an enemy
of the Leaf?

 Right now,
you're on the same side as me.

 You're a pawn that I resurrected.

 Just…what am I?

 I would say, the body count
has increased by now.

 It will soon be your turn.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Fade into the Moonlight"

 FADE INTO THE MOONLIGHT

This is…war. Tune in again! Hang on! Bring me a hemostat! Quickly. Sakura… Yugao, take her away. All right. Digital Shrapnel! Damn it! Fang Over Fang! – 8 Trigrams Air Palm!
– 8 Trigrams Air Palm! Beetle Sphere! I would say the body count
has increased by now. I guess I'll begin. Fade into the Moonlight

 Are you awake? Well? Did you miss this world? You're… Kabuto Yakushi! Show a little discretion, will you? Keep in mind that
I'm now your master. What…happened to me? Oh… You smell blood? It's not just ten or twenty…
Is this war? Don't tell me Hidden Leaf Village…! It's so funny when there's
a time lapse with you dead people. The destruction of the Hidden Leaf
Village ended long ago. What's going on with
the Hidden Leaf? That doesn't concern
someone dead like you. Anyway, the war is entering
the middle stages and working alone is boring. So I don't mind
keeping you company. The last thing I remember is that
I was tailing you, Orochimaru's spy. That was three years ago. Under Lord Orochimaru's order, I acted as his liaison with
the Hidden Sand. That was about a month before
the destruction of the Leaf. You're late. You're the one
who requested this meeting. My apologies. I had to check the area to
make sure I was not seen. The same goes for us. We can't afford
any leaks whatsoever. Now, hand over the plans and
whatever else you have. First, I need to verify… Is he the one? What's your intent? No… We the Sound value
the Sand as partners. However, for this endeavor, the Sand dispatched
only four including you. You don't trust us, do you? No such thing.
But if something happens, we're going to have to
watch each other's backs. That's why we want to
make sure about him, since he's the key to our plans. Oh, it seems he's here. What a fool! He'll be killed! I give up…
Don't you ever sleep? What do you want? To be blunt, I was planning
on taking you out, to change the match-up
in the finals. That would open up the possibility
of me fighting Sasuke. I know all about your Sand attack. Which is faster, I wonder?
Your sand or my sound? Not feeling too well? Then I'll put you out of
your misery real quickly. Don't get riled… His blood…
goes wild during a full moon. Just what the hell…are you?! So you are the ultimate weapon
of the Sand. However, I cannot let you
have Sasuke. For Lord Orochimaru's sake. This is bad I have to find an opportunity
to get out of here. So fast! I see. So this is the One Tail! I don't believe it. A Tailed Beast,
brought into this village…! There's no denying its power. But are you able to control it? At that level, yes. But when the One Tail
transforms completely and activates
his Playing Possum Jutsu, there's no stopping him. Fine. So don't agitate him now. I'll look forward to seeing him
run amuck when the time is right. But are you all right with what happened?
He's one of the Sound's— I'm sure. He outlived
his usefulness long ago. I thought you would use him
to observe how strong this Sasuke is. There's no need for that. I have already been ordered
to recapture Sasuke. But I failed… What?! Yes… The fact that I was working
for the Sound was exposed. I understood that
you're Orochimaru's right-hand man. Now the Hidden Leaf
know who you are, and you had the gall to come
and meet me? What kind of fool are you? Oh no…
I should put it another way. They didn't find out my real identity… I let them find out. I want to see what actions
the Hidden Leaf take. From the start,
this has been the Sound's plan. The Sand will only act
behind the scenes. That is Lord Kazekage's wish. What on earth?! Here are our plans. It's about time we let them in
on this plan. The Sand, an Allied Nation,
has been colluding with the Sound?! By the way,
I'll clean up things here. No, I can take care of it. There's just one rat.
Piece of cake. Something isn't sitting right. You were there at the location. Why didn't you help the Sand? It didn't matter to me who died. Baki didn't have the strength to
stop the One Tail's rampage. There are always
replacements available. Besides, at that time, the Sound didn't have
an effective intel route to the Sand. The Sand easily disavowed
their alliance with the Hidden Leaf. To keep tabs on
the Sand's true intentions, it didn't hurt to have a corpse. I drafted a temporary report on
the status of each company. Casualties spiked up during the night. I hesitate to bring this up, but… The bodies of the shinobi are
full of secret information. If those bodies get into
the hands of the enemy, DNA data could be taken… In a worst-case scenario, the enemy will use their jutsu to
turn them into military weapons. There's no need to worry
about that! I've taken care of it. But there are many corpses
on the battlefield that cannot be recovered… These three are the bodies
of elite shinobi. I'm certain. Then I'll place them into
safekeeping immediately. Thank you. This one too. He's an elite. All right.
Please line him up over there. All right. The ones with Kekkei Genkai
and their relatives, and those families with
special ninjutsu abilities, are being given highest priority
in handling and safekeeping. When everything is over, SPECIAL

we'll send them back to their villages
with the rest of the deceased. I'll be returning. Thank you very much. She's very skillful and efficient. Well, word is that Miss Yugao
used to belong to the ANBU Black Ops. A former ANBU?
Why's someone like that here? I don't know. But it helps. Corpses make such useful tools. You can revive them and
get information. You can use them as weapons. You can get unusual data
from their flesh. Although, I wasn't able to
get Baki's corpse back then. You're mine! How unexpected. I thought that it would
be settled right away. I have to say… That proctor was very slick,
slipping past me. He's sheathing his sword?! Leaf Style… Crescent Moon Dance! It won't come loose! Your swordsmanship
is impressive. However, the blow from
a real sword can be stopped. But… a Wind Sword cannot be stopped,
no matter who you are! How unfortunate.
You should have tried a little harder. But, oh well, considering
your jutsu wasn't compatible, you fought a good fight. Maybe sometime in the future,
you'll be useful. It's so quiet. The report said it was around here. Hey, you! We got a report that there was something that
sounded like a skirmish around here. Do you know anything? I'm sorry. I'm just passing through. I see… Because of the upcoming
Chunin Exam, there have been
a lot of disturbing rumors. C'mon! Let's go. You'd better get out
of here quickly too. Thank you for your concern. I completely erased the smell. It'll be a while before
the body is discovered. If I return and get caught,
that would be a pain. Oh well…
Just his hair should be sufficient. After that, during the final round
of the Chunin Exam, the One Tail went on a rampage and descended upon
the Hidden Leaf. And what happened to the Leaf? Regrettably, they're still around. The world has changed drastically. The Third Hokage died
in that battle… Three years later,
Sasuke got rid of Lord Orochimaru… And I gained new powers. Are you still an enemy of the Leaf? Yes. And right now,
you're on the same side as me. You're a pawn that I resurrected. Presently, the Five Great Shinobi Nations
have formed an alliance and a terrible war rages on. It is an all-out war
with every village committing every man available. What a great opportunity
to collect samples! And this is where you come in. May I ask you a question? I'm just a little curious… If it's a simple question. I understand you were once
a member of the ANBU Black Ops. With such skill, what are you
doing helping in the medical camp? Every company is shorthanded now. Someone like you… I… I can't fight anymore. Yugao… I'll be right there! Please wait. Right now,
this work is what's best for me. You should return to
your station quickly too— What was that?! That explosion…
It was from the vault! That man is… Hayate?! Yugao! The scroll he has is the KIA list! The bodies of the elite shinobi
have been taken! Get them back! – Right!
– Right! Do not flinch! Not! Get a taste of this! This is fun! That's enough. Let's go! Where's Shizune? She just went into surgery. All right. Notify HQ about this immediately. And get the wounded inside the tent! Right! As for the scrolls
with the bodies of the elite… I saw the faces of the assailants. I believe one of them was a Hidden Leaf Special Jonin…
Hayate Gekko. I see… This medical tent
must be guarded too. Looking at the situation,
we can't spare many people. We'll have to contact HQ
and ask them to send reinforcements. But Iou, Yokaze, will you two go? – Yes.
– Yes. I'll go too. My battle and healing skills
will increase the odds of success for this mission. Thanks. Also, Yugao…
I want you to go too. Huh?! I know that you are not part
of the combat force. But a Sensory-type is essential
in order to track the enemy. You're the only one available now— That's impossible! I can't… Yugao? This is an emergency.
State your reason! That man… Hayate Gekko… was my lover. Yugao, you've come.

 Hayate…

 I'm now an enemy of the Leaf…
also an enemy of yours.

 So I want you to stop me.

 I don't want to hurt you… Please!

 I can't… I just can't!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Night of the Crescent Moon"

 Kill me, Yugao! NIGHT OF
THE CRESCENT MOON

 Tune in again!

 Night of the Crescent Moon

 I know how hard
this is for you, Yugao. Even so, you're the one
for this mission. Sukui… It's cruel, I know. But in order to reduce
the casualties on our side, we need as much intel
on our enemy as possible. It might even help us save lives. Now go, this is an order. You think she'll be all right? This is going to be unpleasant. They've erased their scent. Having a Sensory-type was smart. Yugao, can you pinpoint
the target? They've moved,
detouring around the battleground to the forest up ahead
at two o'clock. If we go around,
we could confront them head on. You've improved. Not bad, huh? I can get one out of two now. Get real. It's more like
one out of three. That's because
you're a Transparency Style. But just you wait,
I'll catch up in no time. Then I just have to
work harder so you can't. You're wide open! My mistake. I won't let you
surpass me that easily. Since I'm going to protect you. Okay, before the fighting starts… We should know about
who we're fighting. Hayate Gekko is an expert
in the Hidden Leaf Sword Style. He specializes in
the Transparency Jutsu. He's highly skilled. You want to avoid close combat. Let's hurry! That was boring.
I wanted to do more damage. Are you kidding?
I'm sick of being used like this. But we got to come back to life. We should enjoy ourselves, right? To meet again like this… But you could… Hey, I'm talking to you.
Are you dissing me, you bastard?! They're coming. Oh, I see… This is what it means to
have a body that can't die. This is pretty convenient. Don't talk too soon! A posse, eh? That's more like it! Two left… I wish we could have stopped
at least one more. That one disappeared quick… This is perfect though. Let's share the prey, fifty-fifty! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Please take care of that one! Right! You've come… Get back. Sorry, but you'll be going up
against me! Earth Style: Flying Stones! You're mine! Please get back. Then return that scroll! What?! Iou! You should pay attention! Go after him too. I'm sorry. I'm now an enemy of the Leaf…
and your enemy as well. So I want you to stop me. I don't want to hurt you… Please! Yugao! Take this! Kill me, Yugao! I can't… I just can't! If you don't… Yugao! Cha! That's all you got? You're the only one left. I have to go. Wait! Damn it! Iou! This is…! Please bear with the pain.
I'm going to close the wound. Iou can't continue on with the pursuit. That goes for you too… I'm sorry. It's my fault. No. But it was true then? That…you can't fight. I'm sorry. I always dreamed about becoming
an ANBU Black Ops, so I lost my head earlier… I'm going to get some water. Where are you going? Hayate hasn't changed his course. So you don't need my help
in pursuing him. There's nothing I can do
even if I remained. Why did you leave
the ANBU Black Ops? Hayate was my lover. At the time, we were training partners
in the Leaf Sword Style. We honed our skills together. There! Impressive. The Hokage himself certified
my Transparency Style. Well, with my Sensory skills
and swordsmanship, I was chosen for the ANBU. But you're still lacking. I'm almost there! Hayate? I suppose I should be happy that your strength has
been acknowledged. But the missions are risky,
far more dangerous than before. Please, I want you to be careful. I heard that… members of the ANBU Black Ops
died at Hidden Leaf Hospital…! I'll be fine. But… They were killed by Kabuto Yakushi. It seems he was Orochimaru's spy. The one who was taking part
in the Chunin Exam? He had us completely fooled. But going after Sasuke
doesn't explain their actions. Without a doubt,
they're up to no good. So we must learn more
about their movements. It's too dangerous. He held his own against Kakashi. But someone has to go. And with my Tracking Jutsu,
I'm the ideal candidate. But… I'm off. Hayate Gekko has been killed. – What?!
– Oh no… No… Not Hayate? He was found on the outskirts
of Kikyo Castle. That's… The destruction of the Leaf Village
happened a month later… Hayate, I'll avenge you. It was my way of memorializing Hayate… So I fought and I fought… But when the fighting ended… My emotions that had been stretched
so thin…just snapped. I couldn't even hold
a sword anymore. Hayate and I were connected
through fencing. Inevitably, a sword reminds me
of his death. Yugao… How can I kill him? How can I go through his death
all over again? Still, I cannot let you go…
and leave behind the injured. Am I right? I understand a little of
what you're going through… I couldn't fight the one
I used to love. But you must see this through. Sakura… Kakashi Sensei told us… "This jutsu is unforgivable." To trample on a person's death…
to trample on our memories of them… I feel the same way! Don't you have to go? Yokaze… I'm sorry if I'm being rude. But that person named Hayate… seemed like he wanted you
to stop him. Yugao…? Just call on me, Hayate…
and I'll come running. When things are really tough… If you need me,
I promise to save you! Then let's make a promise!
With the moon as our witness… I swear to you,
and you swear to me… That we will love each other
above all else, and protect each other. I'll be fine. Our reinforcements
will be here shortly. Please stop, Hayate Gekko. You're…Sakura Haruno, right? You've become a fine shinobi. I don't want to kill you. And I can't let you go. I can't let you have that scroll! I won't get into your line of attack! Right there! Where'd he go? Please run away! Yugao… I'm here. I'm sorry I'm late. Thank you. I'll assist. No, call the Sealing Corps. Killing him won't stop him. Right! – Dance of the Crescent Moon!
– Dance of the Crescent Moon! Yugao… Hayate… Moonlit Night… Secret Sword, Tsukikage! Like you said, you've gotten better. It wasn't for something like this. I regret… making that promise. You're wrong. I wondered what was taking
so long. Hurry up and do your work,
will you? I'm being called… Is he taking my consciousness too?! Hayate… This is pitiful, but… I'm really doing my best. Yugao! Goodbye, Yugao. The moon always changes shape. A promise made on something like
that is bound to get distorted. That's how man sees the moon. Whatever the shape or name,
the moon will always be the moon… That will never change. Yokaze and Iou
have been rescued. I see. That's good. Yugao… In the end… he protected me. Thank you…and… goodbye… Hayate. So, who is he?

 It seems he's a reanimated samurai.
He's really strong!

 Samurai?

 Retreat, you shinobi!

 Old Man? Is that you,
Old Man Tatewaki?

 Is that you, Naruto?
You were alive?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"An A-Rank Mission: The Contest"

 Tell me!
What happened to those two?

 AN A-RANK MISSION:
THE CONTEST

 Tune in again! This is… Okay! Which one's the fake?! Why you…! What're you doing?!
Don't attack so recklessly! That guy… Where have I seen him before? What? A samurai with ninja skills?! Get back!
Put more space between you! What're you doing?!
Where's the Sealing Corps?! They got separated from
the main company, thanks to those fakes. Right now,
we're waiting for reinforcements. Hey, who the hell are you?! What do you mean,
"Who the hell are you"?! You totally beat me up yesterday. You'd better not have forgotten! You're Naruto?! Yeah. You changed so much,
so I didn't recognize you! By the way, who is he? Oh, he's a Reanimation… He looks like a samurai,
but he's super strong! A samurai? Get back, shinobi! I bear you no grudge! However, this body is
being manipulated and I have no control over myself. Furthermore, I am not a samurai… I abandoned
the Land of Iron ages ago… I'm much like a ronin… No, that's not right. I am… Old man… Don't tell me
you're Old Man Tatewaki?! Tatewaki, that is my name indeed. Who might you be? You know him, Naruto? Naruto? Did you say "Naruto"? Yeah! It's me, Naruto,
Old Man Tatewaki! So you're still alive! Tell me! Those two…
What happened to those two? DO YOUR BEST, EVERYONE


This mission is a direct request
from the Feudal Lord of the Land of Fire! Bear in mind that this mission involves
the nation's governance. What a pain. Don't say that. Will we have time to eat? Talking about food again? Why do you care?
Besides, how come you're here?! Naruto will be joining
Shikamaru's team for this mission. Huh? So what's this mission that
we're supposed to go on with Naruto? Well, put bluntly…
It's a kidnapping. – Huh?!
– Huh?! The young lord is a hostage
in a castle in this nation. The mission is to kidnap
the young lord without being discovered. So we kidnap the young lord,
and then what? Are we going to demand a ransom? Get real. This is a political matter. His homeland has a treaty
with this nation. But they want to nullify the treaty in order to establish
an alliance with the Land of Fire. So the mission is
to kidnap the young lord who is being held hostage here
and take him home. So Granny, what rank does this fall into? Normally, it would be a B-rank mission. However, depending on
how fortified the castle is, it may be bumped up to
an A-rank mission. Now you're talking!
That makes it worth going! Hey, we don't concern ourselves
with stuff like that. Anyway, I warned them that there's been suspicious activity
around this nation. And it has something to do
with the fact that his nation wants
to cancel the treaty? If things go awry, this mission will become an
A or S-rank very quickly. I want you as ANBU to
stay in the shadows and watch their backs. Under what circumstances
do I reveal myself? I want you to gather intel
on anything suspicious too… I'll leave it up to your judgment. Understood. The A-Rank Mission:
Food Fight!

 Hey, Mister Sasori… We've been getting
petty missions lately. That's because we accept
every request we get. Money-making and mercenary jobs
don't have an iota of art, hmm. I agree, but we have no choice
but to listen to the organization. World conquest seems a long way off. – Hey!
– Huh? Hey, you're late. We have new missions. One is money-making.
The other is war. Making money doesn't excite me. Yeah… Well then, Hidan and I'll take
the money-making job. Hey, hey! Don't just decide! I'm not interested in money either! Someone has to do it. Sasori and Deidara both prefer war. Let's not bicker about this. Hey, guys… You owe me later! So? Who're we fighting? One nation…a small one. And what's special about
this small nation? The political standing of
a small nation changes all the time. Anyway, the request comes from
a large nation who wants its territory. Interesting… That's the nation's castle? Kidnap the young lord, huh… The problem is keeping it a secret. We're supposed to find a way with Shikamaru's Shadow Possession
or Ino's Mind Transfer Jutsu? Nope. You and Choji are
the key players in this mission. Us? Yeah. Choji, you're entering
a contest attended by the lord. Normally, unauthorized persons
can't enter the castle. But participants will be allowed in. A contest being attended
by the lord is like… Why do I have to take part in it?! Choji's gonna lose right away! No, it's food fight. What? A food fight? You should be happy, Choji. Simply put, it's an eating contest. No kidding, Shikamaru?! Being a contestant in an eating contest
is a mission made in heaven! And what am I supposed to do? Well, while Choji creates a diversion,
you will sneak into the castle, use your specialty Transformation Jutsu… to switch places with
the young lord and buy us time while we make
our escape with the real one. You're okay with Naruto
as the young lord? What's that supposed to mean?! Exactly that. She's right. He's gonna be a young lord. If he says he wants ramen for lunch,
his cover will be blown right away. Aw listen, guys… And watch how you speak. Aw man, you don't have to tell me! – Do you really get it?
– Of course, I do! 63RD FOOD CONTEST
PRELIMINARY SITE Participants, step forward! Let's go! Yeah! In hopes of prosperity for this nation
and an abundance of crops… we will begin the contest. The winner will be duly
honored by the lord and shall receive a generous reward. So everyone, do your best… and partake of the foods
with dignity and grace. The preliminaries will be easy for Choji. – But why Naruto?
– Ramen, ramen… – There's an event featuring ramen.
– Ramen, ramen… Other than ramen,
he's like everyone else. Yeah, well… For the first event…! Bean jam cakes! Huh?! Not ramen?! From the well-known Ama-ama An
in the castle town! On your mark! Eat your fill! Naruto can't cut it, after all. Ino, over there… Huh? That's them? Yeah. That's the young lord in question… Never mind them. Look at him. Huh? That big guy? This nation hires former samurai
as guards. He's the captain of the guards. And the biggest threat
to our operation. Time! Are you okay, Naruto? Maybe not. Contestants who were unable
to finish must withdraw! I barely made it through. We continue on to the second round! A second round now?! The second round is… a ramen-eating contest! Ramen? Right after this?! Ramen from the famous
castle town shop, Gito Gito Tei. Look at the size of this… Pace yourselves… T-Tasty, but… This greasiness right now… T-Tasty, but…these voluminous
thick noodles right now… The roast pork is amazing
and they're generous with the broth. I can't.  – Even though it tastes so good…
– It's a deluxe fishcake too. I can't… I can't take another bite. I want to, but I can't… If I eat any more…
I'll be in trouble… And yet, I want to eat… But I can't! Everyone seems up to the task. Hmm… Father, watching them
has made me hungry. How about some of those
bean jam cakes from earlier? Someone… What about you, Lord Shu? I'd like to try that ramen. Oh, not ramen. Why not? It's lukewarm and the noodles
are too soft. The taster must check
my lord's food for poison, so the noodles always get soft. Bean jam cakes are wonderful.
They stay the same. Is that so? How unfortunate. Lord Shu, it's almost time. Huh? But there's a contest today. That doesn't matter.
Now, let us go. All right. Everyone is amazing… Thirty seconds left! Seems Choji's sussed out his rivals… Five seconds left… Four…three…two…one… Zero… Stop eating! The final round will be held
at sunset. Only those who have finished their bowls
will be allowed inside the castle. Yes! Choji. Do your best! Just leave it to me. Okay, the groundwork is laid. How about we go get some lunch? Watch your side. Always keep moving. Yes, keep your eyes on your opponent. Don't step straight back. Pick it up. I can't move anymore. It's not over. What's the point of training anyway? I'm a hostage.
All I have to do is behave. Fate is unpredictable. Mine…won't change. Tatewaki! I see that you can move. Your training is too harsh. That's all for today. Are you all right, Lord Shu? Tatewaki doesn't like me. He's just being dutiful. After all, he's a samurai. A former samurai. Chosen ones… I commend you for making it
to the finals. No need to be reserved. Eat your fill. All right! Win this thing, Choji! – He can't win.
– Huh? Why not? We want him to come in second. That's the strategy for
the young lord's escape. I see… The first of the final events
is a speed-eating contest… of 100 pieces of sushi. The top three contestants will
advance to the final. These are from the renowned
Neta Neta Sushi in the castle town… Eat wisely! – Okay, let's get going, Naruto.
– Right! – Ino.
– I know. Ninja Art… Mind Transfer Jutsu! Wow…! Lord Shu? I'm going to the washroom. Oh my, what a fine group
we have this year. So this is the young lord. Make it snappy! Transformation Jutsu! Okay, I'm off! Lord Shu, this is a missive
from your father. And you are? I am a shinobi, and I'm here
at the request of your homeland. Finished! Finished! What? Choji's still eating? Clean your plates… and stop! We will take a short break,
then the top three will go on to the final! Oh man, that was good. Choji, do you really know
what you're supposed to do? Sushi is wonderful too. It doesn't get soft. Lord Shu, have some sushi. Nah, I… I mean, I have no appetite. How unfortunate. Is something the matter? It's nothing. I'm just shocked at how much
everyone can eat… The last event is…BBQ meat! Barbecue?! From the renowned castle town shop…
Kemu Kemu-en! Eat with care! Did it work? Well, for now. Oh? If it's barbecue,
it'll be easy for Choji. Well, not really. Huh? Oh my… How amazing. Damn! Well then,
I'll use my Two-Handed Style! Oh look! She's eating with both hands! She's using a special technique. Huh! Then get a load of this!
Lethal Juggler! Oh, he's using two hands too! No, he's using his left hand
to put the meat on the grill, and using his right hand
to eat the cooked meat. Going ambidextrous means
he wastes no time. However… I can't see his chopsticks. So fast. At this rate, Choji will win! Sheesh, he needs to come
in second or it won't work. This is… This is the last… …the last… the last bite! I-I can't move. Finished! Shadow Possession Jutsu, successful! Stop eating! The winner of
this year's food contest is… Isono! I did it! Oh boy… Well done!
All of you are to be commended. I lost. Can't be helped. You slowed down at the very end. You shall be rewarded. The winner, Isono,
is awarded a house. Second-place Choji is awarded
a large wicker basket. And third-place Tamao is awarded
a small wicker basket. And with that,
I declare the food contest over. Wasn't that fun, Lord Shu? Y-Yes. Now I'm starting to get hungry. What a tiny nation!

 Why don't we take care of
this quick with my art?

 Deidara, your job ends here.

 What?

 I'll take care of the rest.

 That's not fair.

 Our objective here is not to destroy
the nation, but to take it over!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Fallen Castle"

 You can just sit back,
relax and observe.

 THE FALLEN CASTLE

 Tune in again!

<i>The Legacy
  
  
</i> Granny Chiyo... What are you trying to do? Medical Ninjutsu...? No... <i>We did what we had to do.</i> <i>Now, if we don't hurry back
<i>to the Village Hidden in the Sand</i> <i>and give you an antidote...</i> <i>More important than that,</i> <i>there is...something...</i> <i>that I still...must do.</i> <i>This is what Granny Chiyo
<i>was talking about...</i> Is that...? Yeah... Hey, what are you doing?! <i>Granny Chiyo...
<i>in exchange for her own life...</i> Sakura... She's going to bring
Gaara back to life! Bring him back to life... Is such a thing...
really possible? This Jutsu... is a special Jutsu that
only Granny Chiyo possesses... Really?! <i>There's no way that such
<i>an extraordinary Jutsu could exist...</i> <i>That Chakra flow...</i> <i>No doubt...</i> <i>It is accompanied by
<i>a considerable risk...</i> Damn...! I don't have enough Chakra... Damn... You can use my Chakra! Would that be possible? Granny... <i>Gaara is a Jinchuriki,
<i>just like he is.</i> <i>More than anyone in
<i>the Hidden Sand Village,</i> <i>Naruto knows how Gaara feels.</i> <i>After all, the Jinchuriki has been

<i>like he has to save Gaara.</i> <i>It doesn't make any difference to him</i> <i>if he's from the Leaf or the Sand.</i> Place your hand on top of mine. <i>Naruto...</i> <i>Naruto's dream is

<i>that Gaara had become the Kazekage.</i> <i>But at the same time,</i> <i>he was also very happy for Gaara

<i>he makes friends immediately...</i> <i>with everyone he meets...</i> Amidst this Shinobi world created
by us foolish old people... I am glad that a person
like you showed up... The things I did in the past
were nothing but mistakes... But...in my last hour, it seems I shall finally be able
to do the right thing. The Village Hidden in the Sand and ...
the Village Hidden in the Leaves. The future is likely to be different
from the way things were in our time... Your mysterious power
that Kakashi spoke of... That power is likely to
alter the future greatly... when you become a Hokage
like none before... And you, Sakura...! Yes... Next time, help the person
you cherish most... not an old lady with
one foot in the grave... You are very much like me... There are not many women
who have a man's courage... You will probably become
a Kunoichi who surpasses her master... Naruto, this old lady has
a favor to ask you... You are the one and only person who is capable of knowing
the extent of Gaara's pain... And Gaara knows your pain, too... Please...help Gaara... <i>Gaara!</i> Gaara...! <i>Who are you...calling...?</i> <i>Whose is it...? This hand...</i> <i>Oh... It's just my hand again...</i> <i>My hand...</i> <i>Me...?</i> <i>Who am I...?</i> <i>I...</i> <i>I am...</i> Gaara... Naruto... This is... Everyone came running to help you. Lord Gaara! Are you all right?! - Yes!
- Hurrah! Thank heavens... That's great! Putting us to all this trouble! Good grief. You're such a bothersome little brother,
making us worry like that. What's with you guys...
acting arrogant like that?! Gaara is the Kazekage, you know. Don't be so disrespectful! You're nothing but subordinates! Gaara... How do you feel? You shouldn't try to
get up so quickly. Your body hasn't completely healed. Thank heavens...! I thought Lord Kazekage...
might really die... There's no way that Lord Gaara
would kick the bucket that easily! Gaara is reserved, cool,
strong, handsome, an elite, and... Yes, yes, but he's still kind
of cute somehow... And yet, he is the Kazekage... This time, I'll show them for sure...
that I can protect Lord Gaara in a crisis! No, I will! I will! Lord Gaara! Out of the way, underling! Come to think of it,
I am still a Genin. Don't feel so depressed. It's a well known fact that women
have a weakness for the cool, elite type. I think Shikamaru was saying
something like that too... <i>He has known the same suffering
<i>I have...</i> <i>And he has taught me that</i> <i>it is possible to change
<i>one's path in life...</i> <i>I, too, want to become the kind of man
<i>that everyone looks up to...</i> Thank you... Naruto! If you're going to say that, you should say it to the old lady, not me... She saved Gaara with
an incredible Medical Ninjutsu... She got tired out,
so she's sleeping now, but... When the old lady gets back
to the village, she'll get well again... No, you're wrong... <i>Granny Chiyo used  </i>that<i> Jutsu...</i> What do you mean I'm wrong? I... She wasn't just using Medical Ninjutsu... She used the Reanimation Ninjutsu. Granny Chiyo is dead. Reanimation Ninjutsu? Wh- What do you mean by that? It's a Ninjutsu that allows you to bring a dead person back to life
in exchange for your own... It can't be...! <i>As I thought...</i> Guy Sensei... At one time, in the Sand Puppet Unit, they were doing research to develop
a Jutsu that could bring puppets to life. Granny Chiyo headed up
the project... They succeeded in developing
the Jutsu in theory, but midway, they decided
that the risks were too great. Before it reached the stage
of human experiments, it was designated as a Forbidden Jutsu
and it was sealed. <i>Amidst this Shinobi world created
<i>by us foolish old people...</i> <i>I am glad that a person
<i>like you showed up...</i> <i>The things I did in the past

laughing at any minute. Her face looks so...peaceful... Yes... Yes... Naruto, you are a mysterious one,
after all. You have the power to change people. Granny Chiyo always used to say
she didn't care about the village's future... She was not the kind of person
to do such a thing for Gaara. Granny Chiyo entrusted the future
to Gaara and you... Hers was a magnificent end,
befitting of a Shinobi. Yeah...just like Gramps, the Third. You're right... Yeah. Now, I can clearly understand
the Old Lady's wish. Lord Gaara...! It's okay... Everyone, let us pray
for Granny Chiyo... <i>Granny Chiyo...</i> The Sand Herald reports
one death in the line of duty: Granny Chiyo of
the Village Hidden in the Sand. Lord Kazekage has safely
returned to active duty. Guy's unit and Kakashi's unit both
completed their missions without incident. They are scheduled to return
to the Leaf Village in three days' time. Is that so? All seems to have gone
smoothly somehow. But I wonder if things are
fine the way they are... What do you mean? Lady Tsunade, if I may
be allowed to speak. Next time:
"Return of the Kazekage" The Fallen Castle


That was a great competition. The Fallen Castle

Let's compete against
each other again sometime. See you around! You totally forgot
the plan, didn't you? You almost ended up winning. It's not funny! He's in there? Yup… If everything went as planned. You're one to talk. My my… You've traveled so far. – Okay, we're good.
– Right. Can I come out? We're safe now. Where are we? An inn in town. Is this a place
where travelers can stay? It's small compared
to the castle… but it's only for one night.
So please bear with it. We're leaving tomorrow? It's dangerous to travel
at night, so we'll set out at daybreak. I see… Can I see what it's like in town? Huh? Well… I've never been out
in town like this. But you lived in that castle? I wasn't free to roam
in the castle either. There's no way I could go to town. I mean, I was a hostage. Say… Can I go sightseeing around town
before we leave? Sightseeing? That's not a good idea. I lived here,
but I know nothing about it. This is the last chance I'll get,
so I'd like to see it. Please! Where am I…? Huh?! Oh no! Lord Shu, it's almost time
for breakfast. Oh! Hold on…
I mean, I'll be right there! Are you awake? We'll leave right after
you're done with breakfast. You'll be fine like that. Just as this land is
unfamiliar to you… the local residents
wouldn't think a young lord would stay
in a place like this. Well, as long as my comrade
does his job right at the castle. Lord Shu, you have quite
an appetite this morning, don't you? Huh?! Maybe yesterday's competition
rubbed off on me… What's this? Dried sardines. And this? Tofu… Hmm… I've never eaten
these before. Please stop looking
and eat quickly. We can only stay
until around noon. First, I want to go to Ama-ama An! Oh, I feel like I'm back
at the competition! Why're you so excited? Since when did this become
a foodie tour? Let's go! This is such a puny nation.
It's sorta a letdown. Say, my man… How about we settle things here
with my art? That's okay, isn't it? Fine. Better drum it into Naruto's head
not to mess things up. What a drag. Things didn't go as planned… Don't look so happy
when you say that! AMA-AMA AN


Oh, here! Found it! Ordering! Lady! One large order of
bean jam cakes! – What are we doing here anyway?!
– This time, I'll show no mercy! – Sorry. How about a bean jam cake?
– Bring it on! Here you go. A piece of
bean jam cake, Lord Shu. This next sentence expresses the importance of time spent
on literary skills. "When sleep is about to
overtake you when reading, " "pierce a pick into your thigh," – Oww! That hurts, ya know!
– "and blood shall flow from your leg." "When sleep is about to
overtake you when reading," "pierce a pick into your thigh," "and blood shall flow
from your leg." "Ya know"? This is next! GITO GITO TEI

I wanted to eat their ramen
one more time! That Gito Gito is habit-forming! Sheesh! How come you're tagging along? C'mon, Shikamaru. It's good camouflage
with them around, right? How's that for my planning? You just like to say
the word "plan." Time to eat! I wonder if they have
a low-calorie menu? Delicious! Isn't it, though? After we eat this, let's go to Kemu Kemu-En
for barbecue! But first, let's savor
the taste of this ramen. This soup is rich,
but not heavy! – That's why you never get tired of it!
– I need to go to the restroom. Chef! I'll have seconds. Hey, Young Lord. If you're planning to sneak back to
the castle by yourself, forget it. I don't know what you plan
to do when you get back, but… What? Maybe he wants to see
the princess? Princess? You mean, Princess Chiyo? – Hey, pops, we want seconds!
– Hey, pops, we want seconds! Choji… Forget the plan. Just do something about those two. Uh-huh… How does one train
for swordsmanship? Now, Lord Shu… Come at me anytime. Why you…! I forgot myself and dodged… Tatewaki… Yikes! Who are you? W-What are you saying, Tatewaki? Where is the real Lord Shu? I'm Shu, ya know! Hey, calm down, ya know! You are an imposter! You may appear to be Lord Shu,
but you cannot fool us! That sudden plan to pretend
to be the young lord was…! Where is the real Lord Shu?!
Tell the truth! Princess! Do not kill him! I know that. But perhaps I can take
an arm and a leg or two. It's not looking good right now. See ya! Men! We have an intruder! Intruder! After him! Do not let him get away!
To your stations! Stat! – They found me already…
– Take him alive! However… That's just what I want!
You can't get me! Nani nani boo boo! Clone Jutsu… A substitute… The real imposter
is still hiding somewhere! Find him! – Right!
– Right! They're heading for the main gate. Which means, this way. The intruder is by the main gate! Let's go! Right. A huge success. And now… What're you doing loitering
around here? The intruder is at the main gate! I fell earlier and
my butt hurt… Silence, intruder!
Where is Lord Shu?! – There's no winner yet…
– Miso ramen with roast pork! – The plan's changed.
– Don't be shy, Lord Shu. Come out. Lord Shu? He hasn't said
a thing for a while. Huh? That brat! The young lord is fine. He's way safer than being
a hostage here! I don't believe you! I'm here to buy them time
to get away. You let Lord Shu escape? Tatewaki! How come you're here, old man? Your clones were a little
too convincing. They practically announced that you were going in
the opposite direction. Anyway, what you just said… Even if Lord Shu has
been taken out of the castle… he hasn't gone too far yet. Nah… By now, they've arrived
in his country. That's a lie. Then why are you still here? You could've snuck out last night. Lord Shu's country is his birthplace. So his nation knows about this… Lord Shu is going home? I see… That is a good thing. Huh? An alliance that relies on
hostage taking is very fragile. And it will leave lasting scars
on Lord Shu's heart. Old man… Weren't you hired
by this nation? A samurai's loyalty is to peace. Peace negotiated between
his nation and this one is ideal. Then, you're gonna let
the young lord escape? But you're the problem. For the sake of peace, those who hired you
must never come to light. H-Hey, I know that. If he is caught,
I shall kill you myself! Yikes! Remember that well! Y-You can count on me! Lord Shu… What is happening? You must take shelter inside the castle! Young Lord! Lord Shu! That's the prologue. Now for the main feature! Deidara, your part is done. Huh?! I'll do the rest. No fair, my man! You said you'd let me… Our aim is not to destroy a castle,
but to take it over. All we need to do is to
get rid of the Feudal Lord and those close to him. By now, they're all inside the castle. Your explosives have
terrified them. Well, that's true… Now, take me to the castle. Then you can simply enjoy the view. Why? How come I get it
so easy, my man? I will pray for your success. Huh? You had nothing to do
with those explosions? Yeah, definitely not. Then take advantage of the chaos
and get out of the castle. What about you, old man? I will accompany the princess
and protect her. All right. Please take care… of Lord Shu! I'm going to find Naruto. Choji and Ino,
get the lord out of here! Got it. I hope Naruto's okay. – Princess Chiyo…
– Think about yourself first! Oh! Lord Shu! Who the hell are these guys?! Puppets? Who sent them? Damn it! Rasengan! What's going on?! Hey, what are you doing here?! Where's Princess Chiyo?! Please find her! Save the princess! All right. So don't go off on your own! You guys… – Sorry.
– Sorry. The Feudal Lord is in the castle
with the chief retainer and others… Okay, it's all right now. What'll you do, old man? I have a favor to ask. Will you take the princess
out of the castle? Huh? What about you? I'm going back to the castle
to rescue the Feudal Lord. Tatewaki… I swear I will protect your father. You must wait with Lord Shu. I will come for you without fail. Are you gonna be okay by yourself? You're the one
I'm worried about. Can you really protect
the princess? Come on! I'm worried about you! By the way,
I don't even know your name. How shall I address you? Naruto! Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto, eh? I shall not forget. Well then, Naruto,
I'm counting on you. You got it! Don't die…old man! Do not get in my way! Anyone! Is anyone here?! My lord! It is I, Tatewaki! You destroyed quite a few
of my puppets. Who are you? I'll just say, the Akatsuki. Why do you attack this castle? No need to know.
I'm done here. Then I cannot let you
leave like this! You shall take full responsibility! You deserve praise,
but your master is already gone… My debt to him is never-ending! I won't waste time on small fries. You know, I've been
working real hard… Then stay there and be quiet! That's what you call dodging well? The pipe is just for show. The needles inside are
the real deal. Well? The toxin on the needles
should be taking effect. Soon you won't be able to move. You're done for. Well then, one last stand! Princess Chiyo! Lord Shu! Naruto! Huh? How come Princess Chiyo
is with you? Old Man Tatewaki asked me. Huh? Tatewaki? Yeah… He's a super-strong samurai! There was unwelcome interference… but it seems the mission will end well. That nation fell to
a larger one, huh? This means there will
be more groups out there who will use the Akatsuki… And what about Naruto and
the others? I stayed by them until
they passed the territorial borders. I escorted them both
to his country. They welcomed the princess too. They've been moving around with
the other Feudal Lords. It seems they're okay. I see… That's what I wanted to know. Now! Capture him at once! Hold it! If I could, I wish I could see them
all grown up… If they saw you like this,
they'd be sad. You're right… Well, now I have no regrets… He took things into
his own hands. Yeah… In the end,
it was as he wished… Just like a samurai. I'm gonna live for
my convictions too. That's a promise, old man. In our next episode,

 we're coinciding with
the release of the Blu-Ray and DVD

 of the movie "Road to Ninja"
to bring you this animated feature

 of what happened the night
before the story took place.

 You see, this story
was originally enclosed

 as an extra feature on
the guide book "Maki no Sho."

 If you haven't read it,

 or haven't seen the movie yet,
I recommend you do.

 It'll make the experience
ten times better!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden,
"Prologue of Road to Ninja."

 Don't miss this episode!

 Tune in again!

 This place used to be called
the "Training Cave" long ago. Hey, so what kind of new jutsu
is the Limited Tsukuyomi? It's a prototype of
the Infinite Tsukuyomi. First, you need to check out
the desires of your target. Since this is the last day
of my R & R, I need to re-energize
for tomorrow. So I'm going to bust out
my reserve of that limited edition premium
ramen that I've been saving. This is boring… All right… Tadah! Guess what this is? Wow! It's the limited edition
premium ramen! Every store is sold out of it.
You can't buy it anywhere! Want some limited edition
premium ramen?! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Do you really want some?! – Yeah!
– Yeah! Do you really, really want some?! – Yeah! We want some!
– Yeah! We want some! Well then… Let's have an ultra-super card game
with this ramen as the prize! – Yay!
– Yay! FIRE I'm so tired. But my long mission is over and
I get a break from tomorrow! Oh, Kakashi! Please take over for me! Sure, sure. Roger that. I need to refresh myself.
Let's go to the bathhouse. Yeah. Lee, are you going
to come with us? No thanks. I would like
to train from now. That's so admirable of you. But don't overdo it or your body
won't be able to keep up— Lee! That's my boy! You're brimming with youth! Damn! Damn it! I will train with you!
Let's go, Lee! Fight! Will he be okay? Follow me! Onward, with the full power
of youth! SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH
STRONG FOUNDATION Nope, I figured as much. Guy Sensei! Stand… Please stand
and face tomorrow! Lee… His body won't do what
he tells it to anymore. Please don't die… Guy Sensei! You told me you would see to it… – Lee, I'll take over here.
– that I would become a fine shinobi! – So can you take a message…
– You promised! Guy Sensei! to Sakura and Naruto? Huh? Why are you so untidy? Match up the seams
when you fold laundry! Do it yourself if
you're going to complain! I don't need lectures
on my day off! The only time you're home
is on your day off! Duh! Isn't that obvious?! If it's obvious, don't talk back! Sakura… Mom's right. So stop arguing and
don't be so…salty! TABLE SALT

Right? Huh? Lee! What's up? Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's about your mission… Oh, the prep meeting for
our next mission? I'll be right there! Sorry to bother you, I have a message for you
"to assemble tomorrow at 6 a.m." It's okay. You gave me
an excuse to leave. I want to take it easy today,
you know? So thanks! Next up is… Yes! Damn, I'm not having any luck! Whoa, that was a close call. Hey, you!
You'd better not be cheating! It's always the weak
who complain. What did you say?! Cut it out, ya know.
You're all me. Whose side are you
on anyway?! Well, now that you ask… I demand that we start over! The loser sure can whine! I've had it! Let's go outside! Sheesh… I don't know if I won or lost… What am I doing by myself
on my last day off? It's lonely, after all. Naruto… Hey, let's go eat some barbeque. It's 1500 ryo for a table at Barbe-Q
and it's all you can eat. If we split it, it's…
How much is that per person? 500 ryo. Well, we just finished our mission.
I prefer a bath to food right now. My vote's for a bath too. Akamaru, you're covered in dirt. I should change your name
to Chamaru as in "brown." Your logic is off. It's because Akamaru
has white fur, but his name means "red." So Akamaru should be called
Shiromaru as in "white." I don't have a clue about
what you're saying. All I was saying to Akamaru is
that I need to clean him up! Then you should take him
to the bathhouse too. That's impossible. It's because dogs aren't allowed
in a bathhouse. Well then, I just have to figure
something out, right?! I need to refresh myself!
Let's go to the bathhouse! – Yikes!
– Hi, Naruto! Let's round up everyone and
go to the bathhouse! Everyone! Let's all go together
to the bathhouse! Lee's the one who suggested this,
so how come he's not here? Yeah, well… He still has 3000
hand-stand steps left to go in training. He said he'll come
as soon as he's done. Gotta hand it to him. Bushy Brow was being thoughtful
because I was all by myself… I sure hope he gets here soon! Just when I thought I'd relax alone… Why's everyone here too? Oh well, whatever. After a mission, a nice, hot soak
soothes all the way to your vital organs! Tenten, you sound like an old man. Hinata… Don't be embarrassed
and try to hide them. You're among women here. Relax and let yourself go
in the bath. U-Uh-huh… Well… It's just that
they keep floating up… I'm jealous of Hinata.
Of her chest that is… I must hurry. 1852… 1853… 1854… I wonder if Bushy Brow is still at it? That guy is so diligent…
and so hard to figure out… This is nothing new. The reason is he's got
the training bug. I like bugs like that. You must see your comrades in
a more generous light. This guy is still smarting
from the time he was left out of a mission. Wow! What a great thing to say! A big heart… Shino… Shino, there's a giant larva
near your groin! He's an insect user. It's obvious
he'd have 'em on his body. Shino… You're one guy I admire
in more ways than one! Oh yeah? Hey, did you hear that, Kiba? Huh? Huh? That's Akamaru. They don't allow dogs in here, so I used Man-Beast Transformation
so he could come. Strike! Not! Watch it, Choji! The water level went down. Now what're we gonna do? – How're we supposed to take a soak now?
– Sorry! – They're making a lot of noise.
– Sory won't cut it! I'm surprised you were able to join us. Your mother's pretty strict. Yeah, she's such a pain! My mom piles on the chores
when I'm off too. And If I complain, my dad threatens to use
the Mind Destruction Jutsu on me! I'm a bit jealous though… Huh? Choji! Use your Expansion Jutsu. Huh? Why? Just do it. Okay. Expansion Jutsu! Hey, the water level went up. Why? There's more water,
but it's awfully tight in here. It's fun being with them, after all. Much better than being alone. I wonder what he's doing now. He's the only one who's changed. If he didn't change,
he'd be here too. Sasuke? How come you're…? Something wrong? What's with that look, Naruto?
You planning something? I was just lost in thought! You'd better not be up to your tricks! W-What? As in Peeping Tom! Huh? – Stop!
– Do that again! I get it. On the other side is… There's also that sort of fun! That bath felt so good… Hey, did you even soak? 2998… Just a few more… Naruto! Please wait for me! Two thousand…nine hundred…
ninety-nine. Now, to get a nice peek at… What was that?! That Naruto! Owwww… – Lee!
– What are you doing here, Lee? Rock Lee, you…! You were peeping?! N-No! I got stuck on something
during training and… It was really an accident! Oh, really? Training on the bathhouse roof? Like we believe you…
I'm gonna pummel you! N-N-No… Bushy Brow… Naruto!
It was you, after all! N-Not. Don't act innocent, Rock Lee! Rock Lee? What happened? Naruto… Listen to us!
Lee was sneaking a peek! What? How disgusting! See, see! So don't pretend! Bushy Brow, you… He's running away! Running away makes him
even more suspicious! Let's go after him! – That hurt!
– What a terrible guy! Let's round up everyone
and go to the bathhouse! Naruto! Let's all go together! It's our day off! Don't stay by yourself.
Let's have fun with everyone! But I still have some training
to finish up. I never lie to myself… I'll rush over
as soon as I'm done! Bushy Brow rounded up everyone,
just for my sake. He wouldn't do such a thing! I misjudged you, Lee! You're wrong! I was training, jumping from
roof to roof and… See, it's torn. I got stuck on something
and lost my balance… and accidentally fell into
the women's changing room. Forget the excuses! Calm down, everyone. It really could have been an accident! S-Sakura… Shut up! I'm going to beat
the truth out of him! Hey, hold it! Bushy Brow's not like that! Naruto… Bushy Brow's our friend! If he says he's innocent,
he's innocent! Don't judge him when
you don't even have the proof! Trust your comrade! You could be right. I just lost it and… N-Naruto… Have a big heart… Oh...! – Huh?!
– Huh?! A very small piece of underwear
that could only be… Mine. N-Naruto… Damn you… What's up? You underwear thief! What? Don't you dare act innocent,
Naruto Uzumaki! I just peeked, is all. Not only that, my attempt failed. This is the worst day of my life. Owww… Why did I have to
go through this?! I knew it! I shouldn't have tagged along
even though I was lonely! Forget those guys… Huh? Lee insisted that we come
and visit, so here we are! Now open up! Maybe he went out. Because he's not answering the door. Too bad. Let's go then. I can tell from his scent
that he's inside. He's probably still upset
from earlier. Damn it! What do you guys
want anyway?! I see…
We came at a bad time. Well, let's go, guys— Oh, all right! I'll hang out
with you guys! What?! You lost again, Neji?
You're so bad at this. I've been out too. You'd better not be cheating. I'm out! The howl of a losing dog! No such thing. The reason is… I can't stand this!
One more time! So we're gonna keep playing? You should stay longer. Sorry. Mom gets on my case
if I'm home late. Me too. I can't miss dinner… – See you again.
– Yeah. Maybe 'cuz it was a fun day. My room sorta feels roomier. Everyone should've stuck
around to eat… Especially times like these. The time is ripe… Naruto Uzumaki… I've seen what's inside your heart! All right! I'm starting the Limited Tsukuyomi! Master Chen! What an honor
it is to see you again!

 How could you have met someone
who died before you were born?

 Master Chen was not dead!

 You're that brat from that day!

 I would never forget about you,
or about the Dragon's Eye!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Old Master and the Dragon's Eye"

 So you're still a shinobi! THE OLD MASTER AND THE DRAGON'S EYE Tune in again! Aren't you going to eat? Oh, well… This brings back
some bitter memories. Are you all right? He's a strong Taijutsu User. Well, I'm here now,
so rest assured. And…there! Hello. You're Old Master Chen! Huh?! The one known as
the ultimate Taijutsu User?! He's the Hidden Leaf hero who died during
the Third Great Ninja War! So I'm famous, eh? Back then, I could only observe you
from afar. As a Taijutsu User, it is indeed a great honor to
be able to battle with you. I'm being manipulated… I won't be able to show any mercy. I'd like nothing better! Great Leaf Hurricane! Great Leaf Hurricane! Leaf Gust! H-He's strong. Guy is…losing ground! Lee?! I'm sorry, I'll be right back! Please stay here and rest, Sai! You… must dodge this. Not the legendary technique?! Guy Sensei! I will assist you! Lee?! Old Master Chen! I guess I'm really famous, eh? I'm so honored to see you again. He died before you were born. How did you meet him? The Old Master was not dead. What?! At that time… If you are the real Master Chen,
I have a request! Please teach me
the Leaf Dragon God! You're that kid? I will never forget you… or the Dragon's Eye. The Old Master
and the Dragon's Eye
 

 You're still a shinobi. One cannot give up on his dreams. What do you mean?
What's going on? So you're his…? That's right, I never told you
about this, Guy Sensei. As I recall… It was soon after I had recovered
from my serious injuries. SECRET TAIJUTSU TECHNIQUES

Oh, look! I just came across it in the library. – Ohh!
– Ohh! The Leaf Dragon God?! It seems to be a secret technique
created by someone known as Old Master Chen. The words "secret technique"
make me excited! Let's find Master Chen and
ask him to teach it to us! But it says this man was
a Hidden Leaf hero who died in the Third Great Ninja War. Huh? He's dead?! It's all right! I'm sure everything about
the Leaf Dragon God is right here. No…! I wanted to master this, to become stronger while
Guy Sensei was away. Bushy Brow… You can just train with me. Huh? I need to get stronger too,
so I can bring Sasuke back. Naruto… Seems this man's grave
is near the village. Really? Then let's go pay our respects
at the hero's grave, get inspired and train hard! Do you bring rice balls here
every day, Azami? Yeah, because it's Grandpa's grave. So she's the Old Master's
granddaughter? Do you know how to do
the Leaf Dragon God?! Of course not! Grandpa's alive. Huh?! He comes to eat the rice balls. That's ridiculous. What does she mean by he's alive? This is so good. Wh-Who are you?! He's Old Master Chen?! That's impossible! He's fooling Azami and tricking her
into bringing rice balls! That's unforgivable! I'm not sharing with you guys. Do not eat them! You ruined my one single enjoyment
in life! Leaf Dragon God! – Huh?!
– Huh?! Leaf Dragon God… Amazing… Amazing. He was actually alive. And so… I believed it was a chance to
learn the secret technique, and went to his grave again. If you are truly Old Master Chen,
I have a request! Please teach me that technique…
the Leaf Dragon God! I cannot use ninjutsu! That's why I want to hone
my taijutsu skills! Can't use ninjutsu, eh…? No, I can't! But I'm doing
my best to prove that I can be a great shinobi
with taijutsu alone. You're doing your best
despite that, eh…? A shinobi who cannot use
ninjutsu cannot be a shinobi! I will pound it into
that body of yours that you are not qualified
to be a shinobi! – Bushy Brow!
– Lee! What happened…just now? You are weak! Just forget about being a shinobi! Th-That's… How could you say such
a cruel thing to my Lee?! You, of all people, should know. It's ridiculous for him to risk his life on becoming a shinobi! How did you know that? He told me himself. You're going to see that old man? We'll keep you company. You guys… Thank you,
but please let me go alone. – Huh?
– Huh? He said I'm not qualified. I want him to acknowledge my skills. – Lee…
– Bushy Brow... And so…I'm going alone! I figured you would say that. Huh? Here… Take this. Azami asked me to give it to you. Thank you… CHEN You're such a persistent kid! I won't ask you to teach me
that technique. But please attack me with the Leaf Dragon God
one more time. Huh?! You said I'm not qualified
to be a shinobi. I cannot accept that. If I'm able to defeat that technique… Please say you'll acknowledge me
as a shinobi! I beg you! Please use your Leaf Dragon God
once more! Your tenacity has won me over. I will honor your request. Although I doubt that
you will be able to see through the Dragon's Eye. The Dragon's…Eye? Now you will realize just
how unqualified you are to be a shinobi! I will absolutely make you
acknowledge me! Leaf Dragon God! Dynamic Entry! Eat, then go home. And quit being a shinobi. Please do it…one more time. The Dragon's Eye…and the tornado. I feel like I'm almost there. Why won't you give up when
you've been beaten up so badly? You're just like him. In any case, forget about
being a shinobi. I…can never, ever give up my dream of being a shinobi. Someone is staking his life on
my becoming a shinobi. I have my promise with Guy Sensei. And you're repudiating it,
so I cannot lose to you! So please, just one more time. Forget your dream. I'm saying this for your own sake. Please wait! And after that,
I never saw him again. "Forget your dream."
You said this for Lee's sake. A shinobi who cannot use ninjutsu in the dangerous world of shinobi
is powerless. Huh? Perhaps one shouldn't even aim
to become shinobi. Old Master, you were not mistaken in trying to get Lee to
give up being a shinobi. Guy Sensei? However… I will never accept that! What you did was wrong! Guy Sensei… I thought you, of all people,
would understand me. However, I will prove to both of you,
teacher and pupil… that you are wrong! We are not wrong! Lee! You should be able
to prove it to him! Yes, sir! I never thought this moment would come. Primary Lotus! The Leaf Dragon God's true form
is a tornado. So the Dragon's Eye is… I can't test it now even if I wanted to! Leaf Dragon God! What's the matter? Have you given up? I believe I've told you before! I don't give up! Is that what you call a dodge? The Dragon's Eye…
is the eye of the tornado! That's its weakness! This is it for the Leaf Dragon God… One-man Primary Lotus! W-What?! My-My Leaf Dragon God?! Why? How can it be? Why won't you give up after all this? I once sustained severe injuries and was on the brink of
giving up my dreams. But Guy Sensei said this to me
at that time… Lee… If you want to be free from
your suffering, make up your mind! Do you mean
to give up my dream? If you give up your dream,
you will suffer even more. You're the kind of fool
that can't go on living if you've lost your Ninja Way. You and I both… Have the surgery, Lee! Your surgery will be a success because you have worked hard
all the way through. You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens. And in the one in a million chance
that something goes wrong… I will die with you! Ever since I met you, my Ninja Way has been to
nurture you into a fine ninja. That's a promise! Guy Sensei! I see… You found yourself a fine teacher. – Old Master!
– Old Master! I, too, had a pupil long ago. And just like you,
he was not able to use ninjutsu. But he said he would become
a shinobi with only taijutsu and through hard training,
his dream was realized. He was to be initiated in the ways
of the Leaf Dragon God, but… the Third Great Ninja War broke out. And my pupil also went
into the battlefield. But for him, being unable to
use ninjutsu and genjutsu was his weakness. And much to my regret,
he was killed. I allowed my pupil to become
a shinobi without even thinking of
the consequences. I am not qualified to be a master. I was unable to forgive myself,
so I abandoned my shinobi life, faked my death and put up a gravestone. I see… So that's how it was. Forgive me. I thought you would walk
the same path as my pupil, that's why… However, you two will do just fine! Old Master Chen… The time has come for that grave
to actually be of use! Old Master Chen… I'll bring you offerings of rice balls. He's a Reanimation too?

 He's crying! He looks like a child!

 Shikamaru! Choji! Ino! It's me!

 Why does he know our names?!

 I don't know this guy!

 Me neither!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 "Rain Followed by Snow,
with Some Lightning"
  

 No, we know you!
 

 Tune in again!


 It's the enemy! They're coming! Damn it, there's no end to them. They're just wearing us out. How long is this going
to continue? Rain? It's raining while sunny? The enemy is coming from
a different direction! He's not one of those white guys... Was he reanimated too? Is he crying? He looks like a child. But this is a war, after all! What's with this rain? I'm coming in, Sakura! Okay! Place him on that table! Take care of this. – We're moving on to the next one!
– Okay! Who are you? What's going on? Snow? Hey... What are you doing? Kon, kon, kon... It's snowing, kon... Kon, kon, kon...
It's snowing, kon. Kon, kon, kon...
It's snowing, kon. Kon, kon, kon...
It's snowing, kon. Huh? What?! What?! Beetle Sphere! Fang Over Fang! Akamaru! Damn it! Lightning Style, huh?! Someone's there! Do you know who it is? Is he angry? Hold on, everyone! Rain Followed by Snow,
                         with Some Lightning


 What was that rain?


 Do you think it's a new enemy?
How tiresome... Expansion Jutsu! Choji! Shikamaru! Sorry, Ino! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Complete! How can he still use jutsu
while he's bound? Hey... This is... My sign! What's with this rain? I can't move. Damn it. Shikamaru, Choji, Ino...
It's me! How does he know our names?! I don't know him. Me neither. What?! Ouch! It's snowing, kon. What? Ouch! You're... You're... I remember... Yota! – Yota!
– Yota! Yota! Yota! Yota... That's right... We know you. I think it's around here. It's a precious kunai set.
What'll I do? Kunai are meant for throwing, so it can't be helped
if you lose them. But my mom bought them for me as a reward for getting into
the Academy! If I lose them,
my mom's going to be sad. Choji is a nice kid,
so we're going to help him out. What a pain. My kunai. Damn it,
where did you throw them? I can't find it. Huh? Rain... Huh? That's odd. It's sunny too. W-What is that?! What? Hey... Is that a person? Oh! My kunai! What's wrong with him? My kunai are stuck on him! How did it get there?! Anyway, let's go. Yeah. My kunai! How pathetic. I still haven't learned
the Tree Climbing Jutsu yet, so I can't climb it
as easily as our dads. But my precious kunai! Damn it. Shikamaru! Choji! Hey, wait. Choji! Good-good! Huh? The rain... It stopped. WEATHER FOR SALE You're Yota, aren't you? Yota... I remember! That's right...
How could we forget! Yota... You're a Reanimation... What? Him too? That's right...
Yota can control the weather. Yota... Please stop! Yota's not doing it on purpose. He's being controlled. Then that means that
Yota is already... Me... Yota. Yota? Is that your name? Yeah. You're a girl? I'm a boy. You're a boy who talks like a girl? That's right. I'm me. You're not from the Leaf are you? I'm different. Where did you come from? From all over the place. From all over?
What nation are you from? Nowhere. What village? I don't have one. I have none, none, none. I wonder if he's lonely. It sure seems like it. What should we do? We should let the adults
in the village know. We can't. There was a big fuss
not too long ago about a stranger coming in. My dad said that there's big-big
trouble between the villages. That's right. If someone like Yota
showed up in the village... – Hmm...
– Hmm... Big-big. Big-big. You're pretty big-big, huh, Choji? Huh? I'm not really big,
but just chubby. You're a fatty-fatso. I-I'm...n-not a fatso! This is bad! Come back! Why you... Yota? What's wrong? My stomach is empty-empty. Stomach? He looks like he's enjoying it. Yeah. I'm so jealous. More! There isn't anymore. You're asking too much of us, Yota. I'm starving. It's growling. More, more. Don't ask the impossible. One more, one more, one more! Stop that! Don't cry! It's raining again while sunny. Wait... Yota was crying earlier too. Hey! Stop crying! Ino is picking on me... It's raining because
Yota is crying... I understand. I'm chubby, so I really understand
how Yota feels. I'm feeling hungry too. Sorry, Yota. I went too far. What's going on?
Why are you guys crying too? I'm not even sad. But I feel sad. We caught the crying from Yota? Yota... Yota... Yota... We don't want to fight you! You don't want to
fight either, right? I'm sure that he doesn't.
It's Yota! Don't you understand?
Yota isn't in control here. It's the same thing,
like what happened with Asuma! Damn Reanimation Jutsu! Yota... Yota! Forehead! Yota... Kon, kon, kon... It's snowing, kon... Kon, kon, kon...
It's snowing, kon... The snow's started again. Kon kon kon... It's snowing, kon. Kon kon kon... It's snowing, kon. Kon kon kon...
It's snowing, kon. – Kon kon kon... It's snowing, kon.
– Yota... – Kon kon kon... It's snowing, kon.
– You're having fun. Kon, kon, kon... Yota! Yota! Yota! Yota! It's us! If you're asleep, then wake up! – Yota!
– Yota! Shikamaru! Choji! Ino! Forehead! Hey, you're... Oh? Oh! Ow ow... Sakura... Oh! Oh! Forehead! What? Snow... But it's sunny... Snow when it's sunny? Kon kon kon...
It's snowing, kon. Kon kon kon...
It's snowing, kon. Kon kon kon...
It's snowing, kon. Yota... Yota... That's... So does this mean
we have to fight Yota?

 It's just like the time
with Asuma.

 We have to fight him
to seal him.

 But how are we going to?

 How can we defeat someone
who controls weather?

 How would I know?

 If I think about it,
we don't know anything about Yota!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Sad Sun Shower"

 How sad! THE SAD SUN SHOWER


 Tune in again!

 The Sad Sun Shower Forehead, forehead, forehead! Geez! Don't make fun! Huh? Snow? Kon kon kon. It's snowing, kon! Yota seems to like you. Your forehead, that is. Perfect. Listen, you… What is it? Kon kon kon! Kon kon kon! Kon kon kon? Geez… I wanted to give him flowers
I put together from our shop, but Sasuke just ignored me
and left. So sad. Poor Ino. Poor Ino. Yota… You're nice,
so I'll give you one! Ino is so bold… to behave that way with Sasuke… Are you having fun, Sakura? Huh? If Sakura is having fun,
Yota is happy too. Sakura… Happy about what? Oh… It's nothing, Ino. Yota is so fickle. When he's sad, it rains… When he's happy, it snows. Huh? WEATHER FOR SALE Those flowers… Did Yota come…? To the village…?! You mustn't do that, Yota. You're supposed to be
a secret from the village. If you're discovered,
there's gonna be trouble. No one saw you, right? Yup, no one saw me. Are you sure? Just one…weird kid. Who?! He was the only one
outside during lunch… sitting on the metal pole. Metal pole? Was it Naruto? Could it be… that boy? Oh, I know which one! He's always alone
and looks angry. Really? He sorta smiles at me. He's weird. Maybe he likes you? What?! Cut it out! Did Naruto notice you? Probably… I dunno. Listen, Yota. Don't go into the village
ever again. If you're discovered,
we might have to part ways. I don't want that! I don't want to be apart from Sakura! Just Sakura? Thank you, Yota. Wasn't that funny though? Sasuke who always acts so cool… looked like a flower garden. So does this mean
we have to fight Yota? It's like the time with Asuma.
In order to seal him… we have to fight! But how? Can we beat Yota's weather? How would I know? Come to think of it… We don't know anything about Yota. How can we…? Dad! Connect me with Sakura! Huh?! All right… Sakura! Sakura, can you hear me?! Ino?! Sorry, I'm in the middle
of something right now! Do you remember? You must! About Yota! Wait, I'm… facing that Yota right now! What's going on?! Over here too! Yota's really mad. What?! How come Yota's by you guys too? Three Yotas? What's going on? Whistling? Who are…you? What's this? Huh? Hey… Hold on! You're…Yota? Are you Yota? Yota! Naruto… Yota… Huh? What? Hey, where'd you put Yota? Interrogating him won't do. Naruto, you know, right? Know what? Well… You saw something, right? You didn't see him? That… If I didn't see him,
how could I have seen him? Huh? You're pretty shrewd, aren't you? Why are you guys so impressed?! Come with me! Hey, what is it? Where did you put Yota?! Huh? Yota? You met him in the Academy schoolyard
the other day, didn't you? The only one who knows Yota
besides us is you! You met Yota, didn't you? You told everyone, didn't you?! Who's Yota? He was a lost kid near the village. We felt sorry for him,
so we took care of him. But when we came here today, everything was a mess
and Yota was gone! Then he's an outsider? Oh… Why would you protect an outsider, but still look at me
with those eyes?! Hey! What a thing to say! He's so cocky. Maybe we questioned him too hard
when we don't even have proof… If he really doesn't know anything… Damn it! Why is it always me? I'm lost… You… Are you… Hey, hey! What is it? What's wrong?! What's the matter? I'm scared. What's your name? I'm Yota! Huh?! So you're Yota, after all! Sun showers? Is this…your jutsu? Wow… Like I can't even do Clone Jutsu
or Transformation Jutsu and Iruka Sensei is
always scolding me. You're an outsider, but everyone likes you… Yet when it comes to me… Huh?! I know you! You were doing…fuu fuu fuu. Huh? You were sitting on the metal pole
the other day and whistling. Oh… Teach me how.
I want to whistle too. Huh? When you whistled,
you weren't alone… You cheered up. I wasn't. I was pretending…by whistling. Then I'll try pretending too. Look, you have everyone… You… Please teach me… how to whistle. Sure… Watch me… First, you just blow
without pursing your lips. Then slowly pucker up. Make wind sounds… Like "fuuu"! He's…happy. So his happiness turns into wind. Say… What is it? Fr-i-e-nd. You're my friend! Hey, there he is! That kid! Hey wait! No! That brat, not again! Yota! I don't like dogs! What did you do to Yota,
you guys?! I don't know! I was walking Akamaru… and I saw him. Then thunder started
rumbling everywhere. It's his doing, right? Yota! Oh, it's him! Yota…! When Yota gets mad,
he makes thunder?! Go! There, there… One, two… three, four… five, six… seven, eight… nine, ten, eleven, twelve… thirteen, fourteen, fifteen… I'm with you, Naruto. Don't be silly, Yota. If you stay with me,
he'll find me right away. Hey, stop it!
Don't act so happy. The weather will change
and he'll know where we are! Naruto's mad… Oh no! Stupid Yota! Go away! Shoo! Ninety-eight, ninety-nine… One hundred! Found you, Naruto. Damn it! That Yota… Is there someone who'll kick
the can to save me? Shikamaru, Choji, Ino,
Akamaru and Sakura! Yota's the only one left. Yota… Yota? Yota is crying… Yota! Yota! We are taking him into custody. He will be kept under strict
observation and interrogated. But Yota isn't like that…! Other than members of the Hidden Leaf, no one is allowed around the village
borders without authorization. You will also be summoned
in time. Until then, go back home
and remain there. Yota… Yota is my… That was the start of
our parting with Yota. And we allowed… Yota to die… Get a grip, Yota! It's all right now!

 It's time for me to go.

 What are you talking about?
From now on, we're…

 I'll never forget about you guys.

 But you guys will forget about me.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Lingering Snow"

 There's no way   
I could forget you! LINGERING SNOW Tune in again! Yota! Please! Stop it! Yota! Yota! Naruto?! Sakura?! Did you just say "Yota"?! Is he there too?! What do you mean, "there too"?
He's with you also? Not only Sakura!
But with us too! Including Kiba! Oh boy… He's really going at it. There are four Yotas? I wonder if Yota is angry at us… Maybe that's why he came to each of us.
Because we let him die. Yota is not a ghost. He was reanimated
and is being controlled! Get your act together, Choji! Hold on a sec! So with Reanimation,
you can be resurrected lots of times like Shadow Clones?! Not until now… I'm positive it's Yota I'm facing. Which means, all of you could
be seeing that white guy! You mean, White Zetsu! So he's not the real one?! But this snow is Yota's… No… As long as the real one is
performing the jutsu, it's possible. Or should I say,
the one controlling Yota. Everyone… These guys aren't Yota! So you don't need to feel guilty! I'll take on your guilt! So… Take them down…
Take down the Yota impostors! Naruto… Sorry, Yota… Lingering Snow


 Yota… Super Expansion Jutsu! Shadow Possession Jutsu! Yota! Even if he is an impostor… Let's go, Akamaru. You've gotta be kidding. Yota… Back then, we tried to save Yota. But… So I'm alone again… Not really. There's six of us plus one dog! We all came. Huh? What—? You guys! You can't just
walk in uninvited…! That's no way to talk.
You looked so lonely right up 'til now. Geez… It's so nice outside… If you stay cooped up like this,
no one will want to…?! It's raining. Huh? Is it Yota? We're going to get Yota back! Where are you from? What village? I don't…know…
about complicated stuff… Ask me easy questions. Where are you from? What village? We're getting nowhere. We should ask Lord Third to come
before things get more intense. Was it genjutsu…? No… Hey! Stop it! Get down from there! Idiots! As if I'd do that! I'm Naruto Uzumaki! I'm a ninja! What? He's one of the students
from the Academy who was with the boy in custody. Try and catch me if you can! All the ninja in the village!
Come and get me! – That damned brat!
– Hold it! Sun showers? He's such a pain in the butt… I heard Lord Third's
Mountainside Image is badly damaged. I heard that too. He lives in our village.
How could he do such a thing? Yikes! Did you see anything? No. It was probably my imagination. Probably… Please, I beg you. Let me go… Shadow Possession Jutsu complete! – Yota! Hey!
– Yota! – Hey! Yota!
– Are you okay? Everyone! Shikamaru, you're amazing, after all. You did a jutsu on grown-up ninja! Are you some kind of genius? Nope… He's still wet behind the ears. Shucks! Don't move. Anyone who threatens
the welfare of the village will be treated harshly,
even if they are children. He could be a spy. You've gotta be joking! Yota isn't… Yota isn't like that! Yota is…the first friend…
I've ever had! Friend… Yeah… My friend…! Yota! Run! This river is deep. But we have to cross it… They're probably coming
after us already. If only we could walk on water… We have to do it. Let's go someplace
where Yota can be free! Naruto! – Choji!
– Choji! – Shikamaru!
– Shikamaru! – Yota!
– Yota! Yota! Yota… Thank you. Yota?! Yota! – Yota! Yota!
– Yota! – Yota!
– Yota! Yota! Yota! – Yota!
– Yota! Yota! Yota! Yota! Yota! Get a grip, Yota! Yota… It's all right now. Yota… Come on, wake up. Thank goodness, everyone… It's okay now. No, you're the one who's okay!
Snap out of it, Yota! I'm already… No, Yota! I'm sorry,
if I hadn't been so reckless… It's my fault… We should've tried a different way… Yota! Yota… I'm so sorry. It's time for me to go. What're you talking about?! From now on, we're… I'll never forget about you guys. But you guys, forget about me. Don't be ridiculous! How can we forget you?! – Yeah, he's right!
– It's true, Yota! You have to forget…
otherwise…it will be painful. Yota, I'm… Yo…ta… And so we forgot about Yota… About all the fun we had… That we were all friends… And I was alone once again. Yota… I never wanted to forget. If I were to forget you… I'd rather live with
the guilt of letting you die…! Yota, do I have to… make you suffer one more time?! How can I bear that?! That's… Naruto… It's me. Yota! Yota… It's our secret tin can telephone…
just between you and me. Whoever is controlling him
won't be able to hear us! Naruto! That voice inside your head! Yota! – Yota!
– Yota! It's Yota! Sakura! Shikamaru! Ino!
Choji! Kiba! Akamaru! I'm sorry… I'm sorry…
I'm so sorry. Why are you apologizing? We couldn't save you. We let you die… That's why everyone's… Naruto… Everyone… Don't worry yourselves over that. Because when I met you guys,
I was already dead. I was reanimated,
then I met you guys. I was already dead. WEATHER FOR SALE I was born into a clan that DISTANCE: 2.44 MILES


possessed the strange ability
to control weather. We went from village to village. Selling weather was our trade. Even in my clan… I was especially good
at controlling the weather. But I was born very weak… and I died. I died, but…I wasn't allowed to die. Yota… Be useful now… The snake…and the glasses fellow… They said they were
testing Reanimation and… they left me in your village, Naruto. I was…so sad. Yota… Yota… We're so sorry
we couldn't stay with you. Oh no, don't be sorry. You know, it was so tough
when I was alive… I was always alone,
no matter where I went. But after I died,
I wasn't alone anymore. I met all of you…
And it was so much fun. I was resurrected at
that river once more… And I had to live alone all over again,
although I was dead… But I had my memories of
all of you, so it wasn't hard. And it's too bad it had to be this way… but I got to see you again! You've grown up so much, Naruto. You too, Sakura… And Shikamaru… Ino too…and Choji. Kiba and Akamaru,
you look like you're doing well! Yota! So let's have more fun! Who cares about Reanimation?! It'll be like old times! All together! We'll be happy, and mad, and sad,
and have fun! What…is this?! Kon kon kon…
Kon kon kon… I'm so happy… I'm having fun… Yota! Naruto… Everyone… Thank you! I'm going to go
while I'm still happy. Now this time, don't forget me. I want you to remember me. No, Yota! I have no regrets now… I can really die now. Bye-bye, Naruto… Everyone! I hope tomorrow is a sunny day! Yota…! I didn't expect to lose
this many of my pawns.

 So then, what's my next move?

 Maybe I'll stir things up
on the battlefield.

 To think I'd have to resort to
sending in you guys as well.

 But I think you'll be useful

 in taking back the powerful pieces
that I've lost…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Reanimated Allied Forces"


 That's what you
sacrificial pieces are for. Tune in again!

 I didn't expect to lose
this many of my pawns… Furthermore,
retrieving unique corpses turned out to be a failure… So then, what's my next move? Summoning…Reanimation Jutsu? The Second Hokage
originally developed it. But he sealed it away
as a Forbidden Jutsu. That was such a waste,
so I restored it. You became enamored by
another's jutsu, Lord Orochimaru? It's very convenient, you know. Naturally, I've made
quite a few improvements from the Second Hokage's
original jutsu. But there's still much
I can do with it. And I must have more materials
containing individual data. Materials containing
individual data? What do you mean? Oh, like blood and flesh… from legendary shinobi. I've collected what I could, but… From now on,
you can help me. We shall perfect this jutsu. I understand, Lord Orochimaru. Maybe I'll stir things up
on the battlefield. The Reanimated Allied Forces


 Are they…allies?! Yes! Hey! A Sealed Reanimation? Yeah… That's Toroi,
the Cloud's Magnet-Style User. I'm amazed that just the two of you
managed to seal him. No, actually… Naruto came to help us. The famed shinobi who was being
controlled by the Reanimation… He must be turning in his grave. My dad went on a mission
with Toroi and was killed… Huh? No kidding? The burden was probably
too much for my dad. Hey, look over there! A Reanimated Ninja! There's still another one! We have to seal him immediately! Summoning Jutsu. What the—?! It's a huge ambush…! Contact HQ for reinforcements! R-Right! To think I'd have to
resort to sending in you guys into the battlefield… Our orders are to take back the Reanimated Ninja
who have been sealed. Don't order me around!
I won't listen to a Leaf Ninja! Enough… We are no longer part
of the transient world. It's annoying,
but we're all being controlled and under the same orders. I'm giving the orders! All units prepare to attack! Who the hell are you? The Red Cloud of Dust…
Daimaru of the Wind! So you know me! I don't know you. You must've died before me! Anyway! We're being controlled and there's
nothing we can do about that! Whether we kill or get killed,
let's get it over with! I don't wanna die… Stop the quibbling! All units, attack! We have the advantage in numbers! H-Here they come… On guard! That's like
an Allied Force-sized army of Reanimated Ninja! I-If we come
face to face with them… it's probably over for us… Attack! Hey, get back! Don't come! Stay away! Hey, this is bad! They're…weak. Maybe they're only genin. It's no good! It's no good! Who said we had the advantage?! Attack! Sealing Team, advance! We can do this! Seal them! Seal them! Don't tell me
those Reanimations are… I reanimated a lot of them… But gathering individual data
is hard work. You're literally looking
for dead bodies. And you can't tell who they are
when they're rotting… I had lots of failures. And they're the failures? The enemy's only strength
is in numbers! We attack in one sweep! Musai?! Are you…Musai?! Don't tell me… Dad?! Huh?! Your dad?! Is he strong? You didn't get past chunin class,
right, Dad? You fool! Say I was strong,
even if you have to lie! There! They're coming this way! They're after Toroi! What?! Be careful, Musai. Our duty is… Taking back my powerful pieces
that I've lost. That's what you sacrificial pieces
are for… W-What happened?! This is…not right, Kabuto. I agree, Lord Orochimaru. Who the hell are you guys?! I'll ask just in case… You aren't the Magnet-Style User
Toroi, are you? Are you kidding me?
I can't hold a candle to Toroi. What shall we do, Lord Orochimaru? Let's keep him for now. Sorry, I can't disobey. As strange as it sounds,
I'm going to rescue Toroi. Absolutely not! We'll protect him! Over there! That's the reanimated force
we got the report about! Stay focused and attack! All right! Reinforcements! Is that…? No way. Huh?! Hey! It's me, Bro! It's me! You? How come?! Were you reanimated?! How's my family? My kids? They're all fine! They're doing well in the village. Good… They're all okay… Your wife remarried
and she's happy! Huh? She got remarried?! I guess that can't be helped. I hate to do this to my own kin,
but I have to seal you. Huh? Hey! It's me! It's me! Huh? What the hell?! Why'd you let yourself
get reanimated?! I couldn't say it until now… But I was wrong. Forgive me! Huh? Oh well, forget it. It's all in the past
and you're dead. You'll forgive me? I forgave you long ago… Really?! Dad, I'm sorry,
but I have to seal you. Wait! Before that…! What is it? I fought alongside Toroi
until the very end… for the sake of the village! Please make sure
you tell Lord Raikage! All right, Dad, I will. More reinforcements are here! There's quite a few of them. Keep them occupied. Leave the rest to me… Swirling Smoke Jutsu! Smoke! Never mind! Attack! The platoon will follow me! I said not to order me around! How tragic… To be forced to fight when
there is no desire to fight. They…made peace with themselves. Who are you referring to? Those guys from the Cloud… They were able
to clear their conscience… after such a long a time. Do you have any regrets? I died when I was so young… Wouldn't it be strange
if I didn't have regrets? Well then, so do I…! What about you, priest? Death is one's destiny. You're quite enlightened. But not during my lifetime.
What about you? I felt no lingering
attachments in life. Although now that I'm dead…
I do feel some regret… Regrets? What a funny thing
for you guys to talk about… However, I didn't reanimate you
for such discussions. I've just returned. How did it go? There's no mistake. It's Gari, the Explosive-Style User
from the Hidden Stone. Rummaging for corpses again? At least call it "grave-robbing." Whatever. You're still just
exploiting the dead. Don't…Sasuke. Good work, Kabuto. Yes. Okay, I'm ready, Orochimaru. What are you making me do today? Don't be so hasty. Today's training will be special. Lord Orochimaru was killed… And I was alone once again. However… However, I never tried to
surpass Lord Orochimaru. I simply clung onto his power. I understand how you felt now. You made me realize something. You made me realize that
I wanted to be like you. So this time, I'm going to
surpass Lord Orochimaru whom I've taken in my body and find my new, powerful self. What? I thought you were Sasori… But you're his grandmother. THE GREAT NARUTO BRIDGE The demon… Zabuza Momochi… Carry on once again as one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men
of the Mist. ASUMA SARUTOBI DAN KATO HAYATE GEKKO SUKEZO YAMAMOTO JOUTA MISHINA You're Hanzo of the Salamander? N-No, I'm the right-hand man
of his right-hand man… Heiji of the Rain Shelter… FIRE TEMPLE You are Chiriku of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve? No. I am Chiriku's mentor, Chukaku. Oh, you're stronger than Chiriku? No, I am merely a scholar. What a motley crew of failures. Still, I have use for them. Good grief… This is all of them? I don't know… Maybe some escaped
under cover of the smoke. Contact HQ. Tell them that they were targeting
the sealed Reanimated Ninja. Ask if the others are safe… I see it. Over there! Hurry! We must rendezvous
with Gaara's Main Company! Temari! A message from HQ! We must turn back immediately! What?! Someone known as the Third Raikage
is sealed in there. I guess that means
we're supposed to resurrect him. Leave it to me! TRAP It's a barrier. Earth Style: Sand Dance! The barrier is broken, but… I can't undo this. It's a stubborn Jutsu Formula,
isn't it? First, we have to decode
that Jutsu Formula. Well then, it's my turn… Although I have
no desire to do this. But can you do it? Jutsu Formulas fall under
the expertise of we priests. Hey, not bad, priest! Blade Dance Jutsu! It took forever to
seal the Raikage. We're not going to
let him come back! Temari! Huh? How I've longed to see you, Temari! Huh?! She knows him? Beats me. D-Daimaru?! How'd you become reanimated?! I have nothing to lose anyway,
so I'll tell you! W-What's that?! I've always loved you! Wind Scythe! Oh well, it can't be helped. After all, I'm a Reanimation. But Temari… At least tell me
how you feel about me. Listen… When we were kids,
you were always mean to me. And you tell me this now? Oh well… I'm sorry about back then. But I'm dead, so I can tell you. You were always on my mind. Then why were you so mean?! Aw c'mon, Temari,
it can't be helped… Boys are like that. Like what? Like that. I think it's beautiful, Temari. There's someone who wants to
declare his love for you… More so, now that he's dead. It's so romantic. It's only because
he's been reanimated. Actually, I'm surprised
that you were. Hey, I'm Daimaru
the Red Cloud of Dust. Like the unremarkable
C-rank mission where you lost your life,
your name is unknown. Temari… Did you hate me? No. It was fun being around someone
who wasn't intimidated by me being
the Kazekage's daughter or the older sister of Gaara… Then… Then had I lived,
would you have gone out with me? Nope. No way. No way. Damn, you're so honest.
I like that about you. Temari already has
someone she likes. Yup, an intelligent guy. I figured so… No, I don't! There's no one! Okay, better seal me. When I heard you had died,
I was sad. Seeing you now must be fate. Did you cry?
Tell me, did you cry for me? No… I didn't cry. Sealing Team! Make it snappy! R-Right. So long, Temari. So long, Daimaru… Now then… Be careful. He belonged to
the Leaf's Foundation and was Danzo's bodyguard. He must be strong. As you know… we cannot defy our orders. Therefore, stay away from me. Blade Dance Jutsu! Was that a Clone Jutsu? Notify HQ about him. We're going to rendezvous
with the Main Company. – Right!
– Right! We couldn't retrieve
the pawns we lost… But this pawn has turned out
to be quite a find… Hurry up and seal me…
or you'll be destroyed! Good job finding me…

 My beetles notified me.

 Based on your appearance,
it seems you were reanimated…

 Do you remember
my Venomous Beetles?

 Hurry and call for reinforcements.

 You won't be able to
stop me by yourself.

 No, I'm the only one who can stop you.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Shino vs. Torune!"

 As insect users,
let's settle this just between us!

 SHINO VS. TORUNE!


 Tune in again!

 We just received word from
the Fourth Company! Lord Danzo's ANBU bodyguards
have been reanimated. You mean Torune and Foo
who were listed as missing? Probably. So they were killed… Yes… Both of them? Only Torune has been confirmed. Notify every company! He is to be sealed
the moment he is located! Is he that formidable? He's the son of Shikuro Aburame. If he's being controlled
through the Reanimation, there's a horrible possibility
he will use a Forbidden Jutsu. Get word to Naruto too! I wonder what happened to Foo,
Lord Danzo's other bodyguard. That's right… He belonged to the Yamanaka Clan. Yes… I didn't want him to
join the Foundation… What's the matter? Even if it's a Forbidden Jutsu,
why resist? Nothing is forbidden anymore. Jar of Poison Jutsu! You certainly know your stuff. I'm counting on you to finish it. Damn it… To be forced to use
this Forbidden Jutsu… Shino vs. Torune


 Good job finding me… My beetles notified me. You're…Shino? Torune… Is that you, Torune? Yeah. Based on your appearance,
it seems you were reanimated… That's right. Which means…you died. Unfortunately, yes. How is Lord Danzo? I heard he died. I see… So Madara killed him after that… It was not quite like that. But never mind...
Please tell me what all this is. It's the Jar of Poison Jutsu. Jar of Poison…? Insects are rapidly
multiplying in this hole… Do you remember
my Venomous Beetles? I would never forget. That's because we grew up together
like brothers. Have you gotten used to
the Academy yet? Not yet. That's because
my class is so rowdy. I prefer playing with insects like this. That won't do. In time, you will go on missions. When you do, having friends
and not having friends will make a huge difference. Torune, you didn't go to
the Academy, did you? That's because I'm special
even within the clan. Special in what way? I guess it's time I told you. My body is host to… nano-sized Venomous Beetles
with extremely toxic poison. My body has antibodies
for the poison. But if any other living thing
is infected, the cells in its body will
be destroyed and it'll die. Don't touch it! These Venomous Beetles
thrive only in living cells. They destroy cells as they multiply. If their host dies,
the Venomous Beetles will also die. Like a virus? Yes. These insects can
only survive in my body. That's why I can't touch anyone. Torune, so it's not that you didn't
go to the Academy, you couldn't go there.
That's because… You're right. But you're different. You must get used
to the Academy quickly and make friends. Charge! Huh? Hey, there are bugs on your desk! He's right! Just leave them alone. That's because they're my insects. Oh, so you collect bugs? Don't most people collect
rhinoceros beetles or staghorn beetles? Say, let's throw these bugs
at the girls in class. Wouldn't it be fun watching them
scream their heads off like "eeek"! These insects aren't
for that purpose. Bugs are bugs. Let's do it! Let's make 'em scream,
like "eeek"! Make who scream? Eeek! I don't understand this thing
about friendship. That's because
everyone is so different. Even if they're different, if you spend time together,
aren't they your friends? Well then, I'd have to consider
my entire class my friends. It's not like that. You analyze things too much. Dad… Is he your son? Yes. He's at a suitable age
to enter the Foundation. Pardon? As you know, the Foundation is
where ANBU agents are developed. Those who show great promise
are selected when they are still young. The Foundation is being reorganized and I would like the Aburame Clan
to send us someone. Has Lord Third approved this? Selecting recruits to the Foundation
is wholly under my jurisdiction. Every clan that possesses a Hidden Jutsu, including the Yamanaka and
Uchiha Clans, has sent someone. But Shino is… He's your son.
He must be exceptional. What is this about, Dad? Let me make it clear.
This is not a request, but an order. But that's… If he wants someone exceptional,
won't I do? Torune… And you are? From the looks of you,
you're not even a genin. I'm the son of Shikuro Aburame. Shikuro had a son? As fate would have it,
we became his guardians. You couldn't bring him out
into the open, huh? Interesting… He's a bit older than I'd like, but… the Foundation will take this boy in. I should tell you… You can't team me up with anyone. Get off your high horse. You aren't the only one
who knows a Secret Ninjutsu. Come to my place tomorrow morning. Understood. Torune… Are you sure about this? It's not like joining the Foundation
will kill me. But we won't be able to
see each other anymore. This is good-bye. But why, Torune? Entering the Foundation means
abandoning everything until now, as well as your future. Thank you! Thank you for all you've done. Those Venomous Beetles
are extremely lethal, but they can only be
transmitted through touch. So what is the meaning of this Jutsu? This Jar of Poison Jutsu requires
a large amount of flesh. That's why it's considered a Forbidden Jutsu. But I was able to gather
many from the battlefield. With this amount of cells,
the insects won't die. They'll just keep multiplying while the decaying flesh releases gas. I see… So it's the gas... And the gas is then ignited… the cells carrying
my Venomous Beetles will scatter and infect everyone
in the surrounding area. That's what the Forbidden
Jar of Poison Jutsu is. So it doesn't discriminate
between friend or foe. Hurry and call for reinforcements. You won't be able to stop me
by yourself. No, I'm probably
the only one who can. It's useless, Shino. I underwent rigorous training
at the Foundation. I know that all of you in
the Foundation are skilled. I never thought it possible, but I even made a friend
in the Foundation. Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Sphere! Foo… Did you make any friends… Shino? I don't know if I have friends. That's because I'm not sure if
they consider me their friend. Always analyzing. To me,
it's just judging things accurately. I think it was a good thing
that I joined the Foundation. With my physical constitution, I couldn't be an ordinary shinobi,
taking on ordinary missions. However, the Foundation's ANBU
was a good fit for me… As someone who uses
a Secret Ninjutsu. Making contact with your opponent
is the basis of your jutsu. I want to see how good
you are at taijutsu. Spar with Foo. But my body is… Lord Danzo has told me about you. The main thing is to avoid
touching your skin, right? And besides,
you won't be able to touch me. What did you say? You just entered the Foundation today. Don't think you're my equal. Begin. You call that being on guard? If I were serious,
you'd be dead by now. Lord Danzo wants to know
your true strength. You have to fight seriously.
Come on! You're all talk. Show him. Yes, sir. There you go. Hold it right there! Damn it! From here on,
you two will form a cell. Foo, teach Torune about
the Foundation. Yes, sir. With him? The Mind Transfer Jutsu
and the Venomous Beetle Jutsu should work well together. Do you know what happened to Foo? No, I don't. You were both listed as MIA. I see… Maybe Foo's also
been reanimated somewhere. We have no reports about that. Shino, why waste time listening
to me ramble about my past? You haven't called for help. How do you intend to stop me? I know you're trying to buy time. That's because the insects require
more time to multiply. You intend to die together
with me. But that's futile! Don't attempt close combat with me! If I can't use my beetles,
this is the only way. Then get someone who's skilled
in long-distance combat. As well as a Sealing Jutsu User. I don't know of anyone who
fits that description right now. Shino! You're…Naruto! Yeah, but I'm a clone. I came over 'cuz
I sensed your chakra. Is that the guy HQ sent
messages about? I'm impressed
you recognized my chakra. It's from my training. No, I didn't mean it that way. Shino, don't let him attack recklessly. I just have to pulverize him, right? If you do that,
the Venomous Beetles will scatter. Besides, our opponent is
a Reanimation. We have to seal him. Also, don't touch him, because his Venomous Beetles
will infect you. Not only by touch… Poison Cloud Jutsu! Get away!
And definitely, do not inhale. That's what happens if
you touch him or inhale it. Naruto, don't you have a Sealing Jutsu? No. Do you? I've been given Sealing Tags,
but I have no way to apply them. Get rid of those tags, Shino! I'll be forced to destroy anyone
who gets in my way. My body will attack on its own. I won't let you lay a finger on Shino. I'll stop your attacks! Naruto, you're the one
who can't lay a finger on him. That's because… I get it, Shino. Watch out, Jinchuriki. The Assassination Jutsu
of the Foundation… Like I care! Rasengan! No! Get away! Naruto! Shino! Damn it! Jinchuriki, take me down! Seal me! Otherwise, I'll continue to…! Hey, are you all right?! Get back, Naruto. Huh? You're…? From here on, as Insect Users,
let's settle this just between us. Shino, how in the world…? I know you touched
my Venomous Beetles. Your Venomous Beetles
touched my beetles. You were like
an older brother to me. I wanted a keepsake from you, so I nurtured and bred
those Venomous Beetles. I raised them by feeding them
my beetles. Several years later,
after many generations of offspring… beetles with antibodies against
the Venomous Beetles were born. They are those beetles. With the antibody, they won't die even if they come in contact
with your Venomous Beetles. You may be an Insect User, but no one can host
such a unique insect… Especially not in this quantity. Yes, I carried about ten with me. Then I made them multiply here. Maybe it's the effect of
the jutsu barrier, but it took less time
than I calculated. Shino, you're… I know you're trying to buy time. That's because the insects
require more time to multiply. You never skip a detail. But not like before. That's because I'm not alone anymore. Forgive me, but I must seal you. You don't need to apologize. Say, what do we do
about all this inside the hole? Don't worry.
The Jutsu User has been sealed away. Eventually, these insects will die. So it's all over? Please go, Naruto. Kiba and Hinata are over that way. Right! Torune, I'm grateful to you. I'm glad I didn't have to
join the Foundation. That's because… Hey, what about you? Hurry up, Shino! That's because,
I was able to make friends. I know I've been told
to leave Naruto alone…

 but not the Eight Tails.

 I want to conduct
Lord Orochimaru's tests on him!

 Bee, I have just
the Reanimated saved for you!

 This guy's…!

 You're the former Jinchuriki, Fukai!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Hole in the Heart:
The Other Jinchuriki"


 It's been awhile, Bee!


 A HOLE IN THE HEART:
THE OTHER JINCHURIKI


 Tune in again!

 Man, what a relief. You sure took a long one. Naruto's way ahead of us now. I couldn't hold it in any longer
And you're about to lose your composure But now, I'm feeling good and dandy
So don't worry, be happy Instead of wasting time
on your silly rap, let's hurry after Naruto! Bee! I finally caught up with you. What's up, Brother Motoi? Lord Raikage ordered me to come. I'm supposed to assist you. Thank you, Brother Motoi. How come your hand is wet? Don't sweat the small stuff. And where's Naruto? I was a pissin' and he went a missin' That yellow leader's beyond reach
What's irritating is the school teach I see, so he went ahead. Pissing?! Hey wait, Bee! That's the Eight Tails!
He's this far already? We should try to delay him. Bee and Naruto are approaching. I was told to leave Naruto alone… but not the Eight Tails. I want to conduct
Lord Orochimaru's tests on him! Bee, I'll prepare
the perfect Reanimation for you. This will be fun! Bee, your hand was wet because… Don't make a big deal
out of nothing, Brother! It probably wasn't just "nothing." Damn! The enemy! W-What was that all about?! No way, is that…?! That's… You're the former Jinchuriki… Fukai. It's been a while, Bee. And you're…Motoi? Why are you here…? Someone performed
the Reanimation on me. Fukai… That day 30 years ago… Yes, the day you died. We tried to stop
the Eight Tails' rampage and eight shinobi lost their lives. My dad was among them. I see. I'm so sorry. But I know that apologies
won't bring him back. Yes, he's Fukai. But why? No matter how hard I try, I don't remember
a lot about that rampage… Bee, this chakra I sense from you… I see, so you became a Jinchuriki. Probably, after me… this boy will become
the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki. Isn't that what you've heard
from the elders? No… No one's told me anything yet. My old man, my uncle…
They all failed. I'm not compatible either. Listen, as your cousin… But look, you have the Eight Tails
under control right now… Just listen! Only those who are Jinchuriki
can understand. Friends and acquaintances start
to look at you differently afterwards. They probably think
they're treating you the same, but you begin to see
that they're not. You don't get rewarded for this.</ And you know you're headed towards the darkness filled with fear and loneliness. "Am I compatible?" Walking through life with the shadow of your own death
beside you... It fills your mind day
in and day out… And you begin to lose sight
of who you are. You feel a hole in your heart. And the Tailed Beast waits to pounce on that weak heart
and run wild. When you live with
the constant fear of death, you start wanting to die. But…you have a knack for ninjutsu.
You have the skill and the ancestry… You have everything going for you! Yeah… That's exactly the reasoning
they used when they chose me
as the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki. But that's not what's essential
to become a Jinchuriki. So what is it? Having something that can fill
the hole in your heart! What is this "something"? It's just "something"! If I can find it,
I feel I can stay strong. Let Bee find that something. Bee… I can't control myself. So run! If the Eight Tails isn't
inside you no more You can't fight like you did before You're wrong! All right, Fukai. Why don't you show them
you're serious? Bee! Motoi! Get away! What?! The Tailed Beast Cloak! This chakra…
It's unmistakably mine! When did he…? What's going on?! How's it possible?! The Eight Tails' chakra through
a Reanimation…? This is one of my secret weapons. Lord Orochimaru's laboratory
was full of interesting things… Of all the places…? I have something
very precious hidden away here. This is… The Eight Tails' horn. The Eight Tails? I obtained the cells of the Eight Tails, and it took me years
to cultivate this much. When did you produce this? Long before you were born. What I had to go through to get this. But with this, all sorts of
experiments are possible. That Kabuto… If he can revive something
like this through Reanimation… Why would he bother engaging
the Eight Tails? He could have sealed this chakra
in the Gedo Statue! Dodge this, Bee! Damn it! Get away, Bee! He's ensnaring us
in his attack too! That was a good one, Samehada That's some appetite He devoured the chakra of
the Tailed Beast Bomb?! Well, it's my turn to make an entrance. Bee, are you going to go
into Eight Tails state? – Lariat!
– Lariat! All this force just from colliding
into each other?! A Hole in the Heart:
The Other Jinchuriki


 Why do you have my chakra?! When you died,
I extracted myself from you. It's been a long time, Eight Tails. To think we'd see each other
under these circumstances… I'm disappointed too. I had high hopes for you… We were completely fooled. By whom? Thirty years ago… Oh, it's you, Ay. Watch how you approach me. What's wrong? Can't sleep? Yeah… especially during a full moon. It's like the big hole in my heart. You still haven't found
something to fill it? I probably won't. Even if I'm physically here…
my heart is dead. I wander the desert alone. If I can't get out of here,
I'll never find it. Is there anything I can do? My heart is too sick. When the time comes…
I'm counting on you. Here you go. They're not the usual ones. They're new. Those will help you sleep better. I see. Thanks. I will fill your heart. It's useless. That medication you took
was my special genjutsu pill. Why…you…! Living is difficult for you, isn't it? I shall liberate you from the pain and suffering of being
a Jinchuriki, and guide you back from
the land of the dead… All right, Eight Tails…
Come on out! Don't mess with me,
you lowly humans! Orochimaru? So that's what happened. No wonder I don't remember it… I was also trapped in
Orochimaru's genjutsu. So my true enemy is Orochimaru! Bee! Run! His power right now isn't a problem. We can handle it, Bee! Reanimation… Different form
Easy annihilation Yay! Tailed Beast Bomb! Did it work?! He revived! It's useless. Run! The only way to stop
a reanimated body is to seal it! Bee, let's prepare for the sealing! Retreat for now! Oh, well then… I won't let you get away, Eight Tails! What is this? Chakra from two Octopops?! Don't tell me there's another
Eight Tails?! Don't go back, Naruto! Old Man Raikage! Let Bee handle this. But…! Bee will not lose. Besides, even if you go, you can't bring down
what Fukai has become. Huh?! Only Bee can fill the hole
in Fukai's heart. The hole in his heart? Okay, Old Man Raikage. I'll believe in Octopops! This is not good at all! We're in a quandary
Yeah, what a calamity But escape is my specialty How can you rap at a time like this? Wouldn't you rather jump into
a hole if there was one? Hole… A hole in the heart… Damn! Look at them fight! My dad courageously
fought guys like them… What am I waiting for?! I'll draw him in! Make a run for it then! Brother Motoi! Lightning Style! Spider Web! Stop! Brother Motoi! I told you to get away! I won't lose
You're my teacher But this time, I'll give the lecture I owe it to you… Oh no! Bee, do you know why Ay is strong? Ay was raised carefully,
without being pampered because he was in line
to become the Raikage. All that was bestowed on him from
the villagers, including Lord Raikage, he has graciously accepted, and fulfilled their hopes
and expectations. A boy who was once prone
to tears and so sensitive, grew up to be mighty and strong… As someone special to Lord Raikage. A special person? That's how I found it. What is it, Bro? Hmm? Mmm… You will now become a Jinchuriki. Things won't be the same anymore. It will be extremely tough. No kidding?
It's always been like that I'll just give the octopus
A nickname as I rap Listen up, Bee… Always tell me everything, got it?
You are special to me! We are the ultimate tag team. I have special people around
who always support me. I see… You found them…
Lots of special friends… That "something" to fill
the hole in your heart. And you're one of those
who are special to me That hole in your heart,
I'll fill it completely If only I had been able
to find it back then… Bee, stop this war! Are you okay, Brother? Yeah… Did I fight bravely like my dad? Oh yeah… You had courage out there. I'll take you to the Medical Corps
right away. I'm all right. Just… Bee, carry out Fukai's wishes. You got it, Brother. Fukai… Your sadness ran so deep But that's over, 'cuz this I vow
My real war is just starting now There's a special way to fight
between Puppet Users.

 And I'm the only one here
who can do this…

 Right, Granny Chiyo?

 After meeting Naruto,

 I was able to do the right thing
in the end.

 I thought I died, leaving some hope
for a bright future.

 But it seems…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Soul Living Inside the Puppet"


 Sasori, I was… THE SOUL LIVING
INSIDE THE PUPPET


 Tune in again!

 The Soul Living
Inside the Puppet


 Retreat… Retreat! The Chakra Threads of world-class
Puppet Masters can control humans as well as their puppets. But once the Chakra Thread is cut,
there's no harm to the human. I'm indebted to you. I was about to slay an ally. There's a special way to fight
between Puppet Users. And I'm the only one here
who can do this… Right, Granny Chiyo?! Kankuro… Sasori… I erred in everything I did… But after meeting Naruto, I was able to do
the right thing in the end. I thought I died, leaving some hope
for a bright future. But… As I stand before you, I can't help
but regret the past… Sasori… When are mother and father
coming back? Well, they'll be gone a little bit longer… I see… I couldn't bring myself
to tell him the truth… Sasori was too young to know
about his parents' deaths… Sasori… Sasori had already figured out,
that his parents were dead. Sasori! How've you been? Huh? Granny Chiyo said
your last puppet was a huge hit. Some day, I want to be
a shinobi like you, where everyone praises my puppets… Hey! Are you listening?! Hey, it's me! Komushi has come
to see you! Hey! Answer me! H-Hey, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry. But you're treating me worse
than a puppet. Oh well, I might as well wait
until hell freezes over to get a response from you. I have a message from Granny Chiyo. She wants the puppets
she ordered sooner… The Crow, Black Ant and Salamander… Oh… Everything she requested is done. Oh, so these are your new creations. Man, that was quick… I don't like to keep people waiting. Yeah… That's true. Hey… That's amazing. They look so human! Oh, I almost forgot. About your new creation… She asked me to inquire about
the poison for the Crow puppet. Huh? These are all rare medicinal plants! You're gonna make
a mixture out of these? This is going to require permission. All right! I, Komushi, will negotiate this!
So give me some time. I don't want to wait. I guess not. Then let's go! It's me, Komushi! What is it? Oh… Did you relay my message…? Granny Chiyo, Sasori has a request. What is it? There's not much I can say without knowing the blending ratio
of the mixture. But since this is coming from you,
I have no issues with it. I'll clear it with
the Pharmaceuticals Division. I'm in the middle of research,
so you may leave. Man, you've got it made, Sasori. You're still young, but you're already
contributing to the village. Granny Chiyo must be
so proud of you. Are you listening to me? Granny Chiyo is always
worried about you. I can't wait to be acknowledged
as a full-fledged shinobi… just like your puppets! My own parents still treat me
like a kid! They tell me I'm not suited
to being a shinobi… But this time,
I was assigned to border security. It's just guard duty,
but if I can prove myself… Komushi! What have you been doing
at this hour?! I was so worried! Wait… Cut it out,
you're embarrassing me! I'm going to be assigned border
security missions from now on… You can turn down things
like missions! I'll take care of you
for the rest of my life. I want you to stop it! Thanks, Sasori! I heard that you were injured on duty? I messed up. But… That's…a puppet arm! That's not all! I feel stronger than before. And it fits perfectly. It feels like it's always been
a part of my body. How could you ingest
your own poison?! Granny Chiyo… He's… He's not to blame. I'm the one…who messed up… Where is Sasori?! Do we have the blending ratio
of the poison yet? Please heal him… Please heal him… Heal him! Please! You attached his right arm too, right? Then his left arm can be… His legs, his body… You can even heal his soul, can't you?! Give him back to me! Heal my Komushi and
give him back to me! It was a painful accident. Komushi was my link to Sasori… Not only that… He was Sasori's only friend. How has Sasori been lately? The same as usual. He's been working on
small puppet parts recently. And they look like
real human hands… Huh? What? Impossible. It has to be a coincidence… But something is… I hope my fears are ungrounded! I don't like to make people wait. From what I can see, I thought there'd be
a little more progress. Sasori! What are you doing?! You barely got it to
the standard size… Sasori! It's Komushi?! As requested… The model is finished. I wasn't able to be at his side
when he was suffering the most. When he desperately needed love… No, I made excuses and
distanced myself from him. I'm the one who distorted him. I'm sorry… Much good it does at this point… An apology from a reanimated corpse
to the puppet that you are now! Your technique is as sharp as ever. But you don't have any fighting spirit! I guess Puppet Masters aren't good
at being a puppet, eh? Inexperienced ones shouldn't act
as if they know…. Don't make light of
the Reanimation Jutsu. If the user of the jutsu gets serious… Oh, speak of the devil! Reverse Secret White Technique… Esematsu's Ten Puppets! What?! Wires? Wha—?! Sasori…as well as
Sasori's Mother and Father… I recovered and repaired them. Sasori told me… that he was a human
who wasn't able to become a puppet. An incomplete puppet with
a core that was living flesh… Do you think he wanted to
be closer to his parents who had become puppets? How could anyone want to
become a puppet without a soul? Possibly… But you know… I can sense the souls of
Sasori's mother and father inside these puppets. I'd like to believe that
Sasori felt it as well. Granny Chiyo said… that Sasori was able to see
his mother and father's final attack. But for some reason,
he didn't counter it. Yeah… It must've reached him. The cry of his parents' souls. I admit I'm inexperienced. But I'm not so ignorant
that I couldn't feel your regret and sadness
through your Chakra Threads. You say the first thing
that pops up in your mind! That's why you're inexperienced! There are things one wants
to atone for, but can't. Besides, I'm a corpse. There's nothing I can do! Sasori entrusted me… I entrust you with the Father
and Mother puppets. Sasori entrusted you…?! Puppets that only Sasori could create. Their workings are so delicate…
all the way down to the fingertips. So he shares a love and
passion for puppets, just like Sasori did? Sasori's soul dwells in
these two puppets! And his love instilled the souls
of his parents in them too! Sasori, at least, was able to feel it. Puppets with souls?! That's not all, Granny Chiyo… The love you gave to
his Father and Mother puppets became a part of their souls. Huh? Sasori was aware of that. And he gave them all to me… Rather, he entrusted them to me for future generations
of the shinobi world. Passing it on is our duty too. Sasori did that…? Sure, I'm inexperienced and
in your eyes, a stranger. But my kid brother… Gaara received your soul
and came back to life. So I'm not a stranger at all. And I can sense it through
the Chakra Threads. Sasori and his mother and father… The family's thoughts, their love… Their souls are saying… "Please stop Granny Chiyo!" Family… Mother! It's only a family portrait.
Don't be so stubborn. You fool! The meaning of
the word "shinobi" is to be stealthy! I will not take a photo,
to be put up as decoration… and have people say,
"Oh, what a fine photo" at parties! W-We wouldn't go that far… Of course, you will! Granny Chiyo… Don't you want to take
a photo with us? No… It's not that. What are we going to do with you? Oh, what are you doing? – Oh!
– Hey! I will say though, they are in the hands
of a fine puppeteer. Granny Chiyo! Just kidding! Playing Possum for real! Now then… Sasori left his Mother and Father
to you as a present… I must leave you with something too. All I can give you now are
my Secret Puppetry Techniques. Learn, by experiencing them firsthand! Hey, wait…! Secret White Technique!
Army of Illusions! This is bad! When I was a kid,
I begged you to train me. But you said you didn't care
about the future of the village and totally ignored me! I guess I was young back then too! You were already
an old hag by then! Did you say Omoi deserted
the battlefield?! Is this true, Kakashi? Yes. Reports say he ran
from his post after saying he needed
to leave for a bit. Deserting one's post under
enemy fire is considered a serious offense
in the Hidden Cloud Village! Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Run, Omoi!" Damn it, Omoi,
what are you thinking?! RUN, OMOI! Tune in again!

﻿1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,730
Gimme a break... I wouldn't have thought that my Self-Destructing Clone
would be eaten away too... I'll show you my ultimate work of art... Art is explosive! <i>I somehow made it in time...</i> <i>Then again, I managed to flee
<i>because that acted as a diversion...</i> My arm's getting sucked into space...?! What a Jutsu! <i>What I lost was...
<i>only up to about my elbow.</i> I must search for my right arm and ring... <i>So this is Sasori's true form, huh...</i> Here it is! Zetsu, here it is! I wonder if I can now become
a member of the Akatsuki... One slot has opened up after all... You idiot... It ain't that easy... Oh come on,
why don't you just let him join... Tobi's a great kid... Let's go. Give me a sec, Zetsu! I'm sure...
It's around here somewhere. Uh, hey, Zetsu! Wait, please! Zetsu... <i>Return of the Kazekage


</i> How much longer? They'll be in sight soon! Gaara... That's... Heh...what a lavish welcome. Awesome...! There are so many people...! Just as would be expected
for the Kazekage... Yeah... I'm so glad you're safe... It's thanks to everyone... Naruto Uzumaki, I am truly grateful! No, I...
I really wasn't able to do anything. Lord Kazekage,
the villagers are waiting for you. Right this way... Well, shall we go? Wait. First... You're right... Let us pray that
Granny Chiyo's soul rests in peace. A moment of silent prayer... Big Sister... We're home... Huh, are you leaving already? You should stay a little longer... That's right. At least another day...
until you've rested up. I'd love to do that, but... There's something I must report to
my Master, the Hokage, immediately... I see... And if the Akatsuki have begun
to attack villages, I feel uneasy being away
from the Leaf Village too. That's why you want to get back
as soon as possible, right... Yes, that's exactly right. But in that physical condition... Not to worry...
I have comrades I can rely on. Yeah! Leave it to me! By the way, we have already sent
the first report out through Takamaru, but there's nothing written as to whether the two Akatsuki members
are dead or alive... Shouldn't you inform
your village about it? I'll report that directly to the Hokage. There are other things
I'm concerned about too... Granny Chiyo from the Hidden Sand
Village is the only casualty, and the Kazekage has
returned home safely. Guy's unit and Kakashi's unit
have completed their missions. They anticipate returning to
the Leaf Village in three days' time. All right. Uh... Lady Tsunade... What is it? The last mission went well.
But as Master Jiraiya stated... sending Naruto, a Jinchuriki, into a place where there are people
targeting the Tailed Beasts... I question the wisdom of that... It's true that former Black Ops Unit
member Kakashi is accompanying him, but why take such
a high risk by sending Naruto? It's for the very reason that
he's a Jinchuriki. The only people who can
really understand Jinchuriki are those who are Jinchuriki themselves. Besides...that guy has
a mysterious power... Everyone starts wanting
to place their bets on him. So that's... Granny Chiyo's grave. CHIYO She said she didn't want
a grave. But I thought it would
be better to have one. I felt that everyone needed
a place to gather... Everybody, say your farewells... Okay. Let's go. Okay... Sakura, Naruto...
It's about time to depart. Okay! Let's go, Sakura. <i>Granny Chiyo, thank you...</i> See you... Uh... yeah... Normally I suppose people
shake hands and say goodbye... but I'm not really good with
that kind of stuff, so I'll just leave it at this... Sensei! You guys are too slow! Uh... I'm sorry, Guy. When I use that new Sharingan, it takes a toll on my body
for quite a while... Hurry! H-Hey...! Huh? What is it? <i>That's...kinda disgusting...</i> <i>Old men giving each other
<i>a piggyback...</i> <i>That's more sickening than I imagined.</i> <i>Oh man... That's annoying...</i> I see! It's training, isn't it! Now this way, it'll be faster! Move, move, move! You guys...
You think you can keep up with me?! <i>And when movement gets thrown in,
<i>it's even more sickening.</i> - Neji...
- I refuse! It looks like Deidara was done in too... There's no question that his cause
of death is from an explosion... Don't you agree, Zetsu? He's probably laying there dead
somewhere around there... Get your hands off, you jerk... Hey! He's alive! What happened to the Jinchuriki? I've met my quota... Oh dear, oh my... You barely made it, Deidara... You all right? Guess not. Tobi, even the patience of
a saint has limits... Try saying something again and
I'll decide your cause of death myself... No doubt it'll be death from explosion. That's...past the limit... Death from suffocation... I've already pulled
some strings from behind... So that you'll be posted with
Kakashi's squad. Not only are you close in age
with Naruto Uzumaki, but you are also stronger than anyone
in the village of the same generation... And more than anything,
I admire your superb talent for painting... From today until the completion
of this mission... Your name is...Sai. Sai. Right... Don't put on a fake smile
like that in front of me. I'm sorry... It said in the textbook that
in order to charm people, you first have to be able to smile. I've been practicing, but... I still have difficulty in creating
facial expressions. According to information I've acquired, Sasori is to meet with a spy he sent
to Orochimaru at Tenchi Bridge in the Village Hidden
in the Grass ten days from today. I see...
A clue to Orochimaru's whereabouts? Lady Tsunade, please allow us
to continue on with this mission. But this information itself
may be a trap to lure you in. That doesn't matter. If it is a trap,
I'll fight with all my might. Next time: "The New Target" Run, Omoi


 What?! Did you say Omoi deserted
the battlefield?! Is this true, Kakashi? Yes. Reports say he ran from
his post after saying he needed to leave for a bit. Omoi! Why?
Why would he do that? Come back…
my comrade-in-arms! Damn it, Omoi! What was he thinking?! Doesn't he know the circumstances
that we're in? That even losing one man could
decrease the military strength of the unit! Lord Raikage! That's crazy! Who'd believe that crap
about him deserting! K-Karui… He may look it,
but he's not a coward! He'd never run away
in the face of the enemy. It's got to be some mistake! Well… I don't want to believe it either. But deserting one's post
under enemy fire is considered a serious offense
in the Hidden Cloud Village. So… One thing comes to mind. Is that you, Sai? Just before Omoi left,
we received a report that the unit on Battlefield Seven
was under attack and needed reinforcements. When he heard that,
I believe I saw Omoi go pale. We received a distress call asking for reinforcements
four hours ago. They were surrounded by a large number of White Zetsu
and couldn't move. Two thousand of them. Two thousand… We had no troops nearby,
so we told them to hang tight. We haven't heard from them since. Perhaps that's where
Omoi was headed… Who's holding down
Battlefield Seven? The Amphibious Search and Destroy Unit. Most of them are from
Hidden Mist Village and 24 of them
were deployed to the front. Hidden Mist… Why would Omoi go? We received a disturbing message
right after that. A supply unit which was on the road
near Battlefield Seven never reached their destination. Maybe they went to aid
the Amphibious S&D Unit? This supply unit…
Who are they? The Hidden Cloud's…
Thundercloud Unit! What did you say? The Thundercloud Unit… What kind of unit is it? It's made up of seven,
twelve to thirteen-year-olds. They're young,
but extremely talented. It was decided
they were ready for war, and I assigned them to start
with the supply unit. I guess it was premature… So Omoi knew that… That idiot! Check on the chakra levels
on Battlefield Seven. Is anyone in the unit alive?! White Zetsu are overrunning the area. As for chakra from our side…
seven are present. Seven… The same number as
the Thundercloud Unit. Don't even think about it,
Lord Raikage! Those kids knew exactly
what they were getting into. They were prepared to die
in the battlefield. Those kids…are alive. Damn it! Omoi! Omoi! Sorry, everyone. Omoi! Return to your post! We're at war! You can't just
do whatever you want! Please give me one hour. I'll bring every one of them
back in one hour. Will you stop all this nonsense?! How can you be so easygoing
and say such a thing?! What happened to the guy
who's always so worried. Every unit has lost members. It's just wishful thinking
to assume that the seven survivors are all
from the Thundercloud Unit. Sorry. But the seven are those kids. Still… You'll never make it,
even if you depart now. We're done here if
you're just gonna bore me. See ya! Hey, Omoi! Omoi! Knowing them, they've already taken down
the enemy and are celebrating. They could even be into
their second round of partying. "We can't have any alcohol, okay?
So let's toast with juice." Man, if they say that,
it's gonna last until morning… No good, he's not answering. Lord Raikage! I'm so sorry! Please capture that fool and tie him up,
or whatever! But if there are survivors
from the Thundercloud… We can't give them
any special treatment! Kakashi, Guy, Lee, Sai… You can handle things there
for about one hour, can't you? Huh? Even if it's just for an hour, losing someone strong
like Omoi hurts. But we'll manage. If we try five times harder, no,
ten times harder, it's possible. Just leave it to us! I'll fight a hundred times harder! I'll do things my own way… Well, you heard them. I'm grateful. Sorry, Omoi… I'm counting on you. But Omoi alone… Give me the position of
Naruto's Shadow Clones! That kid…? Just one of his Shadow Clones
has the strength to protect an entire village. Lady Hokage,
that's overstating it a bit. There's just one… A Shadow Clone is headed in
the direction of Battlefield Seven… Although he's not that close. Notify Naruto! I promised Lord Raikage
that I'd do it one hour. But what if I finish this up
in 30 minutes? What if he's so impressed,
he says, "Good job!
You're the next Raikage!" Oh but… Rather than one hour,
it could take three hours. Then he might say,
"Go back to the village!" All right, I'm getting close. Beyond this hill, the land will be all cleared
with nary a blade of grass… They'll have rolled out
the red carpet, and hung up a banner
for me that says, "Welcome, Omoi!" Are you kidding me?
Is this a prank? The Hidden Mist's… You know, you can't stop us… Damn…you guys! Where the hell's the red carpet?! Sorry, but this doesn't mean
I'm going to give up! Naruto Uzumaki!
At your service! You're…?! That Jinchuriki from before… Naruto Uzumaki! Rasengan Barrage! Amazing… You're Omoi, right? I don't understand
what's going on… But I believe you. Huh? Those kids are alive! Save them, no matter what. This isn't about believing. They're alive and they're waiting. Yeah! They're coming! With him here… We can take care of these guys! Instead of thirty minutes,
I can finish this in twenty. And Lord Raikage will say, "I was right.
You are the next Raikage…" Come on! Huh?! Uh-oh… I did it! Oh, good. It was a Shadow Clone. It's not good at all! Naruto was nice enough to… I'm such a fool! Naruto probably thought
I could handle it alone and purposely… let himself get hit! Yeah… These guys aren't that good. I can handle them alone! Those kids are alive! On second thought, it's impossible to do this
in thirty minutes. Even with an hour,
it still wouldn't be possible... How about two hours?
If I get it done in two hours, maybe Lord Raikage
will give me a break… and still name me as a candidate
to become the next Raikage… What the…? The poison gas they're exhaling… Red dirt? The white guys turned red… Does it have something to do
with the red dirt? What do I do? Beyond this point lies
a field of poison. What is that? Found them. They're in there… I'm sure of it! They're alive! They're alive… They're alive…
They're alive! They're definitely alive! No! Stay away! Get out of here! It's no good.
We'll be found right away. They'll be on to us sooner or later. And we're going to run out of air. It was too much for us. We weren't ready for battle. That's why Lord Raikage assigned us
to the supply unit. It's too late for that! Why didn't you oppose it when Yukai suggested that
we go and help? Sorry… I'm just frustrated that
we weren't able to do anything! So am I… I'm mad too, Yukai. I feel horrible that my decision
as a leader… I can't stand this either. If we're just going to wait
for death like this… Let's go out with a big bang, together! I jumped in the water to get away… But I still can't breathe! Damn it, I've reached my limit… Lightning Style!
Thunderbolt! This is… They're alive… They're alive…
They're alive! Even if we all die,
if we can at least deal a blow…! Just one blow! My big brother gave me…this… Big Brother Omoi! Lightning Style!
Team Thunder Bomb! This red soil is rich in moisture. So naturally, the conductivity
of the Lightning Style is gonna be amazing. It's okay to breathe, right? Yeah, but it's not as fresh
as a mountain breeze… I've used up my chakra… Big Bro Omoi, give us a chance
to look good too. Well, I guess you guys can manage. Let's go! Didn't I tell you they were alive? Someone who left his post and
acted without orders has no right to talk! And tell your inexperienced subordinates
not to show off! Nope, it's about time
they started showing off. These guys have come of age. Omoi! You greenhorn! L-Lord Raikage! I gave you one hour, no more! If you don't return within that time,
I will punish you myself! So be prepared! I understand! Thanks… Omoi. I bet I'm gonna fall into
a hole somewhere… and I'll be stuck because
it's so deep… and I won't be able to get out and
the clock will keep ticking… and I won't make it back
by the promised time… and I'll incur Lord Raikage's wrath and… Oh man, why am I always
so unlucky? I finally caught up! You're late! What were you doing? A persistent pee, yo. Anyway, one of your clones
contacted me. What happened to
the other clones? They should be arriving at the frontlines
of every battlefield. All the fakers we'll seek out All the bad guys we'll defeat,
no doubt Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Reinforcements Arrive" REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE We gotta hurry too! Tune in again! Damn, I can't tell. I can't sniff out
the transformed fakes. You're back, Shino! Yeah… Be careful. There's no telling where
the enemy will come from. So you were one of them… Damn it! Byakugan! It's no good. I can't distinguish them
from their chakra. Are you a fake? Stop! I'm the real one! Not being able to tell which ones
are the transformations is… Do not step out of the circle! Anyone who does will be considered
an enemy transformation! Choza, we're getting nowhere
with this. Yes, I know.
That's why we have to wait. Wait? For what? Understood? No one moves! We can't tell
who's an enemy transformation. More Reanimated Shinobi
may appear. Anyone who moves will be
considered an enemy. So do not move! In the meantime,
our wounded will keep increasing… We have no choice, but to wait. Lava Style! Dissolving Jutsu! There's no end to this. We have to do something
about the real ones though… Lee, don't get hit! Why you…! Do not panic! Surround them! I've detected a new enemy! It's a small unit,
but the chakra is unusual… It's… Madara! What did you say?! Madara is leading a small unit. Can you tell who makes up his unit? This chakra is… Fourth Mizukage! The one who was a Jinchuriki? There's no mistake. The rest are all Jinchuriki too! I can't believe he had more pawns
under his control… Where is…Naruto? Reinforcements Arrive
 

 I finally caught up! You're late!
What were you doing? A persistent pee, yo. Sheesh! It sure took long! Had some other problems too. Anyway, one of your clones
contacted me. What happened to
the other clones? They should be arriving at
the frontlines of every battlefield. All the fakers we'll seek out
All the bad guys we'll defeat, no doubt We gotta hurry too! Shikamaru… How long do we have
to stay like this? If that huge one comes back,
won't we be in trouble? At least until Naruto gets here. Until then, do not step inside
anyone else's circle. If you do, even you will
be considered an enemy. We just have to verify
what we know about each other! That won't work either. Several of our guys fell for that. Sometimes, a lucky guess
ends up being correct. This is dull… Uh-huh… Sorry. Please be patient a bit longer. Yeah, I understand. You're here! Finally got here! Nawaki?! Is he here?! Oh, good.
He's gotten real flashy though… Naruto! Naruto? He looks just like Nawaki… We received word from HQ.
I'm glad you came. But… I'm surprised that
Lord Raikage gave the okay for this. Well, Granny Tsunade convinced
Pops Raikage for me. Tsunade sent that boy? Just who is he anyway? The Nine Tails is sealed inside him. The adults call him the Jinchuriki. That boy?! He's my idiot classmate Naruto,
who's been talking big about becoming Hokage
ever since we were little… Don't you think "idiot" is
a bit harsh, Shikamaru? Well, I'm here and
I'll find every one of 'em! But now, he makes you believe
it actually might be possible. Lady Tsunade has hedged
all her bets on him. Naruto, huh… So guys like Nawaki and me
exist in this period too. So let's take down the transformed
white ones, everybody! Yeah! Right! O-Oh… First, that guy over there! Huh?! The rest of you around me
are genuine. Those of you with Naruto's seal
of approval can leave your circle. Consider anyone else who
jumps out the enemy! Let's go! Hey, stop! Stay away! Help! Do not approach! What's wrong? He can still be saved
with Medical Ninjutsu! Stay away! I told you not to move. There's no way to prove
that you're allies! But if we remain like this… He'll die! I'm begging you.
Please save him! Don't let my husband die
in my arms! Hey! What are you doing?! If you don't trust me,
I'll kill myself right here! But please save my husband! Hey, stop! Come with me. You can't. What if…? What if they're comrades?
I must tend to him. Thank you. Sakura! Are you all right, Sakura? Naruto! Naruto…? Looks like you're all right! Gentle Fist! It was a fake, after all! This side is bad. Hinata is…! Neji! Damn it… I won't make it in time! Hinata! This one's…
a transformed one. Who's next?! The two in front on the left. Got it! No way! Neji! Where are you going?
This way! Sorry I'm late. Naruto…? Is that Naruto? He smells different from before! It's all right now! Are you all right, Hinata? Yes. Summoning Jutsu! Finally. Looks like he's managed to
successfully groom that brat Nagato. I didn't think I'd be summoning you… If I'm not mistaken, you're… The user of this Reanimation Jutsu
has a keen understanding of war. To think of using you… Did you say "Reanimation"? This is not the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu…? Why weren't we notified right away
that Naruto was here? Naruto just arrived. I happened to see him first,
but I was in the midst of a battle. Naruto smells differently
from before. I wouldn't have noticed. But you're the one
who sees long distances, so… He looks different from before. So is his Chakra Nature… Then who are you to talk?! Are you really Naruto? I hope you're not
a White Zetsu fake too. I'm Naruto. Can you prove it? It's Naruto. You can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata… Besides, he came to my rescue. Naruto saved me too. When did you get here?! I'll have you know that your fake
appeared not too long ago! I'm the real deal. And I've been here with Naruto since. I'm sorry, Naruto. Everyone is so suspicious. Now that I'm here, you don't have to fight
a defensive battle anymore. I'll search out the fakes
one by one. All right, Naruto!
I've memorized your new scent. And your chakra. Well, smell and chakra don't matter
much with their transformation. They mimic everything, even chakra. But don't worry! As you saw, they turn into trees
when I bring them down. And when I'm in this mode,
I can sense their hatred. I'll find the fakes,
so let's beat 'em together! The one we're supposed to protect
is always protecting us. I'm really useless. Don't let it bother you, Hinata. You protected me twice already. I can't let you keep doing that.
It's not cool! I-I wasn't worried or anything… I can see it in your eyes. Don't be so hard on yourself!
You are strong! Don't come! Let's go. Which one's the fake?! The one with the axe! All right! And him too! Thank you, Naruto. Not so fast! All right! Do it, Sai! Sealing Jutsu…
Crouching Tiger Bullet! All right! Three more left! Are you all right, Sai? Yes… I can continue. No need to worry.
Keep drawing the tigers. I've got your back. And here come
the enemy reinforcements. A whole lot of them too. They're white… Are these the ones that can transform
their chakra and everything else? Things are about to get wild, Kakashi. Our reinforcements have arrived too. Or should I say,
reinforcement…in singular? Naruto has the Shadow Clone Jutsu! I can't use it now,
not in this situation. This time, we'll win with quality,
not quantity! And so… Things have changed, Kimimaro! I can tell that time has passed
by looking at you. It seems you've grown in ways
other than just height. Here I come! I put too much force into it… What happened? He's just as scatterbrained
and rash as ever. For sure… Impossible, is that…? Oh yes, it is. Naruto has arrived at
every battlefield! Good. Naruto has joined up with
the Fourth Company. And the Former Kage of
the Wind, Lightning, Earth and Water… have all been successfully sealed. What're you gonna do next,
tiny old man? I said I'm the Tsuchikage. We should rendezvous
with another company. Our enemy is not the Reanimation. It's Madara. This war will not end until
he is brought down. Our target is Madara! Octopops and I should
be heading there now. Over there! – The combined First and Second Companies
– And those guys too! have detected just about
all the enemies! Earth Style! They're advancing with
incredible momentum. What was that? Sorry, Bushy Brow! The Third Company also
seems to be dominating! Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! – This is…
– huge! The Fifth Company has
the upper hand as well! Cha! The Medical Unit has suppressed
all their enemies. It worked! The tide of battle has turned
overwhelmingly in our favor. See? Humph! Now we just need
to stop Madara who is approaching
with Jinchuriki in tow. We should focus
our remaining strength there and hit him with all we've got! J-Just a minute! What is it?! The enemy is resisting
Gaara's Fourth Company! But…what is this chakra?! Huh? What is this?! What are you sensing? Over there! What is it? Hm? That's the Second Tsuchikage! I thought Gaara sealed him away! Impossible… He used
Fragmentation in that state…? Fragmentation? Lord Mu was able to split
his body and create clones. No… Not clones. It's closer to say
he can split his body into two. Although his strength would be
cut in half too. It's not him! There's someone else! What?! Hey, there's one more! H-He is…! Who is it? You've come at last! Madara… Uchiha! That's him? So that's what he looked
like beneath the mask. He looks exactly the same! What's going on?! What do you mean? Look closely at his eyes. That's a Reanimation! The Reanimation Jutsu brings
the dead back to this realm… Which means he had been dead! Wait a second! I thought HQ reported
Madara elsewhere, approaching in the other direction
with a bunch of Jinchuriki, right? But there's no mistake…
He's Madara Uchiha! The one I fought when I was young. Then who's the man… behind the mask?! If the one before us
is the real Madara…

 then the masked guy we thought
was Madara…is not Madara?!

 So it seems!

 What is that?

 No way…!

 Is that really ninjutsu?

 We can't outrun it!

 He's out of our league!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Madara Uchiha"

 Is this the power of a god? MADARA UCHIHA
 

 Tune in again!
 

 So the guy in front of us
is the real Madara. Then the guy we thought
was Madara…isn't Madara? So it seems… As Tsuchikage, you've utilized
the Akatsuki in the past. Can you speculate who
that masked man might be? There's no one I can think of. But it doesn't matter who he is!
We still need to stop him! Their headbands say "Shinobi." But I see them wearing shinobi gear distinctly from each of
the Five Great Nations… Is this a new allied army? It does appear that we're at war. Coming from him... He must have something in mind. But things don't seem like
they're going as planned. Why else would he revive me
in this state? Who is the caster of
the Reanimation Jutsu? Who knows? I'm Kabuto. I am…his collaborator. Speaking through
a Reanimation Link? Such a sneaky one you are… Your Reanimation is quite special. I've fixed you up so that you're even
greater than you were in your glory days. You know what I was like
during my "glory days"? No. Which is why
I want you to show me… your legendary Uchiha power. I guess they won't be easy
to capture. Very well… Madara Uchiha
 

 Here he comes! Do not look directly into
his eyes! You can't use the Particle Style in
your divided state right now… Sensory Types! Watch Lord Mu! Wait! Gaara, you and Lord Tsuchikage
must recover first. Naruto! Instead of your clones,
go into that mode! The truth is, I can't anymore. I used up my chakra
in the earlier fight! Do you want to dance too? Don't underestimate me! Fire Style! Majestic Destroyer Flame! His jutsu spans a wide area! – Water Style! Wall of Water!
– Water Style! Wall of Water! Here he comes! This is…as far as you'll go! Massive Rasengan! Earth Style: Mobile Core! A Susano'o… He's already activated
the Mangekyo Sharingan! How much longer, Naruto?! Just hold on! Sorry! I'm ready! Get back, everyone! Go, Kazekage! Earth Style:
Lightened Boulder Jutsu! I made the surrounding
sand lighter too! With sand this light,
I could…! Naruto! Yeah! Let's go! If it's like Sasuke's,
external attacks are ineffective. So I should use the sand
at Madara's feet! Go! Naruto! Rasen Shuriken! Why did the masked man
specifically claim to be Madara? The presence of Madara... Even if he were a fraud, if you can convince the world of,
his existence, it would tremble in fear. The name itself is power. That name made us
throw caution to the wind… It fooled us,
then drew us all into war! We've been had all along. Too much energy… H-He…absorbed it! What the…?! How? How come he's got the Rinnegan? My guess was right. What comes naturally after
the Sharingan, is the Rinnegan. I awakened the Rinnegan
just prior to my death. You said your name was Kabuto? What did you do to this body? Like I told you. I made you better than
you were at your peak. You bastard…
You know the secrets of my body? You can't even read
the Uchiha Stone Tablet! But you still managed
to decipher it? I just tested some hypotheses
drawn from years of data from experiments Lord Orochimaru
and I conducted. And now…
You are verifying my hypotheses. You are able to achieve
a piece of that God's… the power of the Sage of Six Paths. Thanks to the power I built into you. Do not misunderstand. This is not power of your creation! Damn! N-No way… What is that? It's out of our league! Is this the power of a god? A meteorite? How did he…? Is that really ninjutsu? We can't outrun it! This is not good… Damn it! It's still too early to give up! Never give up without even trying! Do what you can, no matter how small
the effect it may have! Lord Tsuchikage! Everyone, get as far away
from here as possible! Hey! Run! Hurry! Hurry! You're taking us out too? Of course. That was the original point
of the Reanimation Jutsu… To take others out with you. We'll be restored shortly. A shinobi that can fly…? Then, is he that Fence Sitter brat
from the Stone? What's Gramps Tsuchikage
trying to do?! He's going to try to lighten
the meteorite to stop it! Earth Style: Lightened Boulder Jutsu! Just a tad more… A little more…to stop it! That Fence Sitter brat… He's gotten a little better. All right! It's stopped! We're saved… Leave it to Lord Tsuchikage. I thought we were goners. Well then… What will you do about
the second one, Ohnoki? What was that?! What happened?! This is from our Relay Intel Unit. A giant boulder big enough
to block out the sky has been dropped onto
the Fourth Company's battlefield. It's the source of this tremor! Any further reports from
the Fourth Company since then? What's going on? So many casualties…
in just one sweep! I'm sure of it… It's Madara's jutsu or
something close to it! Lady Tsunade! At this rate…! I'll go! What in the world… was that?! Rubber Pops… I'm just a clone, so why did you…?! I feel bad about the others. But clone or not, you are needed here. In order for us to win. What about Gramps Tsuchikage?! Gramps Tsuchikage! It's okay. He's alive… But he's seriously hurt! So this is the power of
the Sage of Six Paths… Magnificent! This landscape brings back memories. It's Kabuto, right? How much do you really know? About me? I venture to guess… In that battle against
the First Hokage Hashirama, you did not die at Final Valley. On that day… though you lost to
the First Hokage Hashirama, you gained a portion of
his power in return. Am I wrong? No wonder… You're well prepared. You know about our plan? Not in detail… But I am your ally. Although I'm not certain if that fake Madara intends
to carry out your plan exactly… By the way… There are still some survivors. The Tsuchikage and Kazekage
are especially persistent. What should we do? There's something I want to check first. Summoning Jutsu! My stomach…feels hot! This chakra that summons me… Is it Madara?! It seems the Nine Tails
hasn't been captured yet. That's the purpose of this war. The Nine Tails is sealed
in a Jinchuriki. For now… See… He's right over there. That boy is the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki…
His name is Naruto Uzumaki. Uzumaki? Of Mito's clan, eh? He's the brat who attacked me earlier. But he's actually quite something. Capturing him is fine,
but that one in front of us is a clone. Shall we go now to get the real one? No. There's a jutsu I'd like to try out. I think it will make a prettier picture if I do it where there
are people around. It's them! At four o'clock! Wood Style:
Deep Forest Emergence! He can do Wood Style?! I guess this is it for us… Damn it! I don't have
much chakra left!

 I'm at my limit!

 I feel like I'm going to
disappear at any moment!

 What should I do?

 Naruto…enough…

 We'll take over from here.

 I finally have a chance
at reclaiming myself!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Five Kage Assemble"

 I will help you
reclaim yourself. THE FIVE KAGE ASSEMBLE
  
  
 Tune in again!
 
 
 This landscape brings back memories… The Tsuchikage and Kazekage
are especially persistent. What should we do? It's them! At four o'clock! Wood Style: Deep Forest Emergence! He can do Wood Style?! I guess this is it for us… Damn it! I don't have
much chakra left! What should I do? Naruto, this time I'll lend you
my power. Are you gonna say you want me to
surrender my body over to you again?! No… I'll just give you my chakra. I don't care for Madara… If I'm gonna be controlled,
I'd rather it be you than him! If I can keep using Madara like this, I'll be able to control
the tide of this battle. I didn't expect him to become
a card this strong. Naruto! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Giant Rasengan! Do it…Naruto! Giant Rasengan Barrage Line! As you mentioned, he's quite a guy. Right? I used up the chakra Nine Tails
gave me all at once! I'm at my limit! I'm going to disappear
at any moment! Naruto… Enough. I'll take over from here. Lord Tsuchikage,
you're in the same… I finally have a chance
at reclaiming myself! And I've got myself a worthy opponent! The Five Kage Assemble


 I'll fight him! That's crazy! You're in no shape to do it! I'd like to try out some more jutsu… But I don't think
you can dance anymore, Ohnoki. What's that look? Long ago, I showed you
the difference in our strength. Why? That wasn't the agreement! Lord Hashirama is… There is no alliance… Just submit to the power
of the Hidden Leaf! And…never mention the name
of that shinobi in front of me! We shinobi are weary
of all this endless fighting. We've kept on fighting for
the sake of our nations and villages. Without a care about other nations
and villages, we just take! We take away, then they take away
in an endless cycle…! Hatred has caused three wars! That is life. I can't believe
you've lived this long and not learned a thing
from the pain of the past. I've lived longer than you! I've learned twice as much! It's because I've experienced pain
in the past that I can even consider
what would be best for the future! Yet this is the fourth war! Is this what's best? This war is different! Unlike the past wars where
we took from each other… this time, we are fighting together
in order to achieve something different! By watching them, I've learned that time
does not simply pass by! Though slow in pace, the world is
accruing its past experiences… and heading towards "peace." There's no need for the world
to mature any further. It can slumber in the genjutsu
of the Eternal Tsukuyomi! Long ago, you made me forsake myself. That's why… I will defeat you here…
and reclaim myself! The one who will slumber shall be you! Lord Tsuchikage! Come… I will help you
reclaim yourself. The elderly always complain
when young ones try to help… I'll let you all meddle this time! It seems they can still dance. For myself!
For the future! I will bring you down! Damn it! Lady Tsunade! You said your name was Mabui? Prepare to do
your Ethereal Transmission Jutsu! Come with me! Ethereal Transmission is
a jutsu used to transport items! Unlike the Summoning
or Reverse Summoning Jutsu, it's impossible to transport people! There's no time to argue!
Unless we try, we'll never know! I do know! The transmission rate is so fast, the body
cannot keep up and will be torn apart. Death is certain! The only one who survived
Ethereal Transmission in the past is the Third Raikage! But that was only because
of his superhuman body. Now I can understand the Fourth Raikage
since he is of the Third's blood… But Lady Hokage,
it's impossible for you! Please reconsider this! I have an idea… The Flying Raijin Jutsu. We'll summon Genma's squad here. Then if we mark
one of Katsuyu's clones, and transmit her to the site first… I have the ability to survive
being split into pieces… That's not necessary! I will use this. So that's it. But it's a risky gamble.
And you tend to be unlucky with bets… GAMBLE

That's only when I bet money. It's different when I bet my life.
That's why I'm still alive. Lord Raikage! Please tell Lady Hokage
to think it over… Mabui, prepare the Ethereal Transmission… For two. Not you too, Lord Raikage! Shikaku! We have no other options left. It's time for the Supreme Commander
to make his appearance! However, Madara belongs
to the Uchiha Clan… If we don't do something
about the Fire Style, we won't have a chance at winning. We'll use the Flying Raijin Jutsu…
against him. Damn! The more I cut down,
the more confidence I gain. That's why I just have to keep slicing! Right! Yeah! I thought that was a lot of chakra
he was gathering… But I had no idea the sword
would be this huge… I-I can't move… I can't believe that you changed
that sword so quickly. He's pretty good! Genma! Sorry, but could you please
just do as I say? Is that you, Shikaku? It's urgent. Do exactly as I say,
no interruptions! First off, the real Madara
has been reanimated. Sorry, but can I interrupt? I said no! Do it! H-Here I go… Ethereal Transmission Jutsu! I'm surprised… Instantaneous travel
through dimensions… Isn't that the Fourth Hokage's jutsu? We used to belong to a squad
assigned to protect the Fourth Hokage. Now, it's the Fifth Hokage, but… The Flying Raijin Jutsu
was taught to us by the Fourth. But unlike the Fourth,
it takes the three of us for it to work. We apologize for the tight fit. Lady Mizukage… Please bring Madara down! As one of the Seven Ninja
Swords Men of the Mist, I will protect this place with my life! Chojuro… He's matured so much
since leaving the village. Please get ready! Lady Tsunade bears
the Jutsu Formula on her. The instant she arrives
on the battlefield, we will make the jump! Understood! I'm already late getting to the altar.
I won't be late for anything else. Unruly Ay and…Princess Tsunade! I've relayed our coordinates to HQ! Reserve Seal! Release! Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration! Are you all right?! Yeah… Granny Tsunade?! That's her regenerating jutsu! Since everyone is alive,
I guess we weren't late. Finally, I'll get to see some action…
I've been bored stiff! All right, I'm ready! Living long was well worth it. Imagine… Being able to see the day when the Five Kage would be united
and fight side by side. This is perfect. This will make my test worthwhile. Thank you, Princess Tsunade. I'll heal the two of you. Raikage, Mizukage!
Buy me some time! Here we go, Mizukage! Right! Lava Style: Lava Monster Jutsu! Jutsu this pitiful isn't even
worth absorbing! He's fast! Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop! I feel so out of place here… He's probably not dead yet, huh? He's capable of this much destruction…
Stay alert! There's no way for us to jump in. You guys come with me…
I'm going after the other one. Help me! Is that him? Follow me! Let's go! How much longer, Hokage?! Almost done! Are you okay, Granny Tsunade? Whenever you use
that forehead mark jutsu, you get old and fall down! This is different from
the time with Pain. I only healed myself… And besides,
it wasn't much of an injury. I have more than enough chakra! Then heal me too! I may be a clone,
but I can't afford to disappear yet! I'll join you and… That's not necessary. Why…?! This is no longer just
a war to protect you. Lightning Style teleportation
and Lava Style Kekkei Genkai… Impressive attacks… I usually like men
who are hard to melt… But you, I want to avoid. He counters me even
with my speed. More speed… I need to increase
my power to crush his defense! What about your defense? A Stone Golem and a Sand Shield… This war is now a battle
to protect each other! Then, I wanna fight Madara too! A two-fold defensive wall of
Sand and Stone, huh? Also, quite impressive! Here he comes! Time to go on the offensive! Mizukage! Raikage!
Listen to me now! Why you…! Hold it! How pesky! All right. Understood! Mizukage! Water Style: Hidden Mist Jutsu! Hidden Mist… They're trying to weaken
the Rinnegan's field of vision with it. Let's do this, Raikage! Right! That Tsuchikage… He lightened the Raikage
to increase his speed… However… Your punch is light. It's just like the last time.
No need to worry… Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu! Granny, fix me up now! Listen to me, Naruto… You see… This war we're fighting… In the beginning, I only agreed
to join the Allied Forces to get rid of the Akatsuki. But as I fought alongside you all, I started feeling differently. So now, I want to be here as the Tsuchikage of
the Allied Shinobi Forces! In the same manner, shinobi villages that were once
at odds have joined together, are changing and becoming one! So maybe, this system of
the shinobi world which has bred so much hatred
can change! Naruto… Let us deal withthis Madara! I swear we shall settle this
once and for all! It will be our first step in stopping the curse of hatred
we've been under until now! Like Madara, we are similarly guilty
of stirring up hatred in the past. It is our responsibility
to make things right! Rest assured and leave this to us! So… You go take care of
the other Madara! That will become the first step
in promoting hope for the future. Old one, new one… Defeating both Madaras
will bring an end to this war! We will protect you on this battlefield! So protect us by fighting over there! Clone Naruto… I entrust you with
this message from the Five Kage. We will win! Yeah! We'll win! Damn, it's so hard…
I couldn't even put a crack in it.

 Chill out, Naruto…
Fool, ya fool.

 I could've let him pass through me…

 But he couldn't even damage this mask…

 I hope that's not all the power you can
muster to control the Nine Tails.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Unbreakable Mask and the Shattered Bubble"

 This jutsu… This chakra is…?


 THE UNBREAKABLE MASK AND
THE SHATTERED BUBBLE


 Tune in again!


 The Unbreakable Mask and
the Shattered Bubble

 Naruto… Let us deal with this Madara! I swear we shall settle this
once and for all! It will be our first step in stopping the curse of hatred
we've been under until now! Like Madara,
we are similarly guilty of stirring up hatred in the past. It is our responsibility to
make things right! Rest assured and leave this to us! So… You go take care

an end to this war! We will protect you
on this battlefield! So protect us by fighting
over there! Clone Naruto… I entrust you with
this message from the Five Kage. We will win! Yeah… We're going to win! Hey… Chill out, Naruto…
Fool, ya fool. Damn, it's so hard. I couldn't even put a crack in it. I could've let him pass
through me… But he couldn't even
damage this mask. I hope that's not all the power
you can muster to control the Nine Tails… Lava Style:
Scorching Rocks Jutsu! Hot! Water Style… Aqua Mirror Jutsu! These guys… …have the same power…! This is… This jutsu… Is it Utakata? Step away from that girl! A Shadow Clone? What a bother… Give it up and
let yourself be caught! No! He is not an enemy! This chakra… Utakata, you were…a Jinchuriki? You too, huh? I heard rumors that
you had gone missing. So the Akatsuki got you, after all. Yeah… After I left you guys,
they were lying in wait for me. This is where I first
met you, Master. Hotaru… Will you wait here
for just a while? Is something the matter? I'm going to meet with
the Mist's Anbu Black Ops. I'm done running. I'm going to get their permission
to travel and train you. Yes, sir! No response, after all. Did something happen to Tsurugi
and his men? The Six Tails' Jinchuriki… Are you the ones…
who killed Tsurugi and the others? I'm going to build a new world. And for that, I need you. Rather, I need the Tailed Beast
inside you. So that's it. I'm taking you…Six Tails. Finally, you're taking this seriously. Now that's the power we seek… Summoning Jutsu… Go! It's been captured. I expected as much out of you. Now come, Six Tails! Hota…ru… You…must live… Master… Why… Why did you go into
the forest alone?! If you had escaped with Hotaru,
you'd still be… The Shinobi Tracking Unit from
the village was in the forest. I grew tired of running. I wanted to reconcile with
the village and live in peace. I wanted to stop living like a fugitive. And I wanted to spare Hotaru
a life constantly on the run. Utakata, you…! I wonder why I started
feeling that way? Why did I wish for such a dream? Well, it's all meaningless now. I convinced myself that the master
I trusted had betrayed me. And so, I closed off my heart. I didn't know how to trust people. And yet, Hotaru put her faith
in someone like me. Hotaru was also burdened with
a fate she hid from others. The same way we Jinchuriki are. Maybe she sensed that
you and she were alike? Hotaru… Hotaru… I didn't want to hurt anybody. And yet, I hurt Naruto
and Sir Utakata! I'm right here. Naruto and I
are both alive. I… Hotaru? I… I betrayed you, Sir Utakata. I should just disappear along
with this jutsu! No! I won't allow that to happen. A student should listen to her master. You said… "Master"… We're going home, Hotaru. What's wrong? No! No… Sir Utakata… Please get away from me!
Please run! Hotaru! I cannot suppress it any longer
with my own strength! This Forbidden Jutsu is going
to tear me apart… and explode. It's all right. Sir Utakata… Believe in your master. I was like a bubble floating
aimlessly in the wind and Hotaru showed me the way. I made up my mind to
become Hotaru's teacher. Isn't it ironic? Just as I was about to
make good on my decision, my life was snatched away
from me. I was resurrected, only to discover that
I have no will of my own, and am forced to walk
a different path. The ones manipulating you
used the Akatsuki too, and are hell bent on
controlling the world. Are you just going to do
what the likes of them order you to? If you see Hotaru again,
you might be forced to fight her without being able to say anything! You have the will to
take yourself back. This is a meaningless fight. Naruto… I don't know if it's because of
these circumstances or not, but… I just ended up telling you
my true feelings. Thanks for listening… Naruto! Water Style: Bubble Jutsu! Sorry, Octopops! Secret Tradition… Scaled Sneak Jutsu. My shades are the best…
So the light, with my eyes don't mess! I can still see through their evil intent! Wasn't that Yugito just now? These guys are former Jinchuriki. On top of that, each of them has a Sharingan in one eye
and a Rinnegan in the other. Not only did they lose their lives, their eyes were turned into
those disgusting things. Poor Yugito… This could have easily
happened to you. This is no joke. To see them like that
I feel rage and grief… But me not getting eyes
like that is still a relief… Well, you always wear
shades anyway. If you don't want to end up like that,
don't let your guard down! Madara's eyes are the same. His mask's different from
the one he used to wear before. It's got two openings! Unlike the previous one,
this mask was specially made. It's battle-grade tough. So the left eye you always kept hidden
was a Rinnegan, just like Nagato and
that other Madara. We're going to stop both you Madaras! Did you just say "both"? Summoning Jutsu:
Reanimation. Th-This is… Surely, you didn't think that
I would come unprepared? Yes. You can't refuse me. Why you… Where did you get that? Don't worry. I haven't told anyone about this. Damn that Kabuto… Whaddya mean by "both," fool? Isn't this Madara, ya fool? Well then, I don't mind using
my previous name, Tobi. Now that the war's begun,
names don't matter. Madara… Tobi…
Call me what you like. Just who are you anyway? I'm no one. I don't want to be anyone. All I want…is the success of
Project Tsuki no Me, that's all. Existing in this world that knows
only despair has no value. You Jinchuriki had Tailed Beasts
forced into you and you've only experienced despair. Am I wrong? Surely, you can understand
a little of my despair. Who the hell are you to decide… that having a Tailed Beast in me
makes me unhappy?! Even if this world is worthless to you, you really think you can get away
with starting a war and trying to say that you're a nobody? You piss me off. I'm gonna rip that mask off of you! I'll go first! Wheee! Taking this mask off of me… won't be so easy. What?! Eight Tails… Nine Tails… You shall be mine
and I'll achieve Project Tsuki no Me! What's going on?

 I thought their Tailed Beasts
were extracted from them!

 They were probably made back
into Jinchuriki

 after they were reanimated.

 It's like when I fought
the Six Paths of Pain.

 They are linked through
the same Rinnegan!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Jinchuriki vs. Jinchuriki"
 

 It's the same Gedo Jutsu as Nagato's!
 

 JINCHURIKI VS. JINCHURIKI
 

 Tune in again!
 

 Who are you really? I'm nobody.
I don't want to be anybody. I just want to fulfill
Project Tsuki no Me. That is enough. It's not worth living in this world
where only despair exists. You Jinchuriki had Tailed Beasts
forced upon you and you've only
experienced despair… Am I wrong? Surely, you can understand
a little of my despair… Who the hell are you to decide… that having a Tailed Beast
inside me makes me unhappy?! Even if this world is
worthless to you, you really think you can get away
with starting a war and trying to play off
that you're a nobody? You piss me off… I'm gonna rip that mask off of you! I'll go first! Wheee! Taking this mask off of me… won't be so easy. Eight Tails… Nine Tails… You shall be mine… and I'll achieve
Project Tsuki no Me! We're not gonna let
you have Nine Tails or Eight Tails! What's going on? I thought their Tailed Beasts
were extracted from them?! They were probably made back
into Jinchuriki after they were reanimated… I can also sense that the Tailed Beasts are
a bit different from before too… Be careful! You too? Getting bad vibes? Gotta be careful for our lives Corrosion Style! Scorching Rocks Jutsu! This isn't a case of
mistaken identity I take it… My weaknesses have already been
carefully researched. So now, how will you deal with this? He turned his body into lava?! He's trickier than I thought. Water Style!
Giant Exploding Water Shock Wave. He's not all talk either. I wish you'd just allow yourself
to be captured without all this fuss. What a pain. You're back. Yeah, but having to bring
him back without killing him was quite bothersome. It's starting to rain. Looks like it'll storm. Let's take cover under a tree. Or we'll catch a cold. Our leader is waiting
for word of his capture. Immediately after that,
the sealing of the Three Tails and Four Tails
is to occur simultaneously. We'll make him wait a little. Because once the sealing starts,
we'll be working nonstop. He seems to be near death. You really should treat
the elderly with care. You say that because
you don't know him. This Jinchuriki who uses the Corrosion Style Jutsu of
the Four Tails isn't what you think he is. You didn't fight him, so you don't know
what I just went through. Jinchuriki vs. Jinchuriki!


 Samehada is ready to fight
That's fine with me… 'Cuz I'm raring to go…
Are ya ready? Hold it, Octopops! Nice moves… OK! She hasn't spied my…KO! You didn't even see me,
so how'd you dodge?! Fool, ya fool! That's not gonna work, Octopops! It's just like the time
I fought the Six Paths of Pain. Their eyes… They're Rinnegan are all linked.
They're hooked up to each other! What the hell does that mean?! It's the same as
Nagato's Gedo Jutsu! So they've got the eyesight… of six guys! Damn, I can't even talk…! Hot! Aw man!
It's Yugito's Rodent Hair Ball! It's coming after us! It's like a guided missile Time to run, let's hustle Yugito's moves are different
from before… Half left of my expensive scarf…
What a surprise Now it's only worth half the price It's that Sharingan! That's how they're able
to track us so closely! Their Visual Prowess is
enhancing their Jinchuriki abilities! On top of that,
with their shared vision, the six Jinchuriki can
position themselves and time their attacks
with more precision. Bee! Let me talk to Naruto! Yo! Naruto… They're cleverly combining the two types of Visual Prowess
and their Jinchuriki abilities. They're probably on to us too. What do we do? We have no choice but to take down
six Jinchuriki one by one! If it's the same as
that time with Nagato, they're all controlled by chakra. Back then, in order to get chakra, black receivers were stuck
to their bodies. I see…
If we remove it or destroy it… the Gedo Jutsu would be undone. But that's going to be
a problem. It's hard enough landing
a blow on them. And we can't even pinpoint
where these black receivers are. You mean, that thing? Huh? Where?! Take a close look around Yugito's bosom
And you'll see that black protrusion At first, I thought it was her ni--! When they're flaunted,
it's unappealing But just a little glimpse,
it's a good feeling This battle is going to
determine the future. And you're only thinking about… That's it! I'm going to go check out
the others. Wait, Naruto! Our attacks don't work,
and we can't catch them… Hot! I'll just have to put up
with their attacks and grab them! Rasengan! I knew it was here! Then… I'll just…! Are you two all right? Ouch… Bee… We're at a disadvantage
fighting them in the woods. Your field of vision is narrowed! You get me, don't you, Bee?! Oh…yeah… Blow up the entire forest! I'm the Killer Bee and
Eight Tails is here with me! Wheee! Don't fall off of me, Naruto
Cuz' now, the real fight's a go! Eight-Tailed Beast Twister! SHINOBI It seems Lord Bee has undergone the Tailed Beast
transformation already! I sense the immense chakra
of the Eight Tails! It feels like they're on
the defensive! Things aren't looking
too good, are they? Frankly… However, the Five Kage
have Madara on the defensive! We're doing okay for now! The Five Kage are working together. They have to have the edge! What's the status of each company?! The First and Second Companies are on the verge of
annihilating the enemy. Only 27 more…! 26! 25! I'm feeling tired, but… I'll give it one more try…! Just a few more and
we'll be done here! Hey! Kurotsuchi! Don't run off on your own! You're too slow, Dad! Leave the rest…to me! Earth Style! Erupt! The Third Company is down
to two Reanimations. Out of all the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist, only Mangetsu Hozuki is left. I'm getting bored of
fighting these guys. Yeah… The Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist… Zabuza Momochi, Ameyuri Ringo, Kushimaru Kuriarare, Jinin Akebino, Jinpachi Munashi, Fuguki Suikazan… The only one left is…Mangetsu Hozuki. Now's the time to show them
the Way of the Samurai! Let's show 'em the Ninja Way
of Puppet Masters! It appears the Fifth Company
needs a little more time… But there's no doubt that
they have the upper hand! All right! Tell the First, Second, Third
and Fifth Companies as soon as they wrap up… They are to head over to
assist Naruto and Lord Bee! What are their coordinates, Lord Ao? W-Wow… They're all knocked out! Seal them now, Bee! Hey, Octopops!
You know a Sealing Jutsu?! It doesn't matter if those rods are
controlling them or not! We'll just tie them up
with Ink Clones! Sealing Jutsu! Octopus Hold! So that's it! It's only one of Bee's Sealing Jutsu! Just like that and on
a count of three… Namely, in three seconds, the ink will completely cover
their bodies and harden, incapacitating them! Once they're immobile,
we can remove the rods from their chest! – One!
– One! – Two!
– Two! – Three!
– Three! That was an amazing sealing…? No… It was amazing
how the enemy powered up… Go… That masked bastard! He was hiding underground! Bug Bite! Cat Claws! Leech Slip! Oww! It's a strong alkaline fluid!
Your skin's melting! Octopops! Coral Palm! What the hell…?! Naruto! Floral Mountain! This is bad! I didn't realize that
these guys could transform into Tailed Beasts under
these conditions! Naruto, retreat for now.
We need to regroup! Horn Hit! I can't move…! Bastard! Even if you're Jinchuriki, six against two appears
to be bad odds, huh? When I touch you, I win! This isn't good! Uber…Leaf Superhuman Hurricane! Using Naruto as bait, they waited for the moment
I materialized… What a nuisance! Kakashi Sensei and Bushier Brow Sensei! Two more joining the party isn't going
to change anything. Not against my Visual Prowess
and power of the Tailed Beasts. We have Sharingan on our side too. As well as the Noble Green Beast
of the Leaf! You came! Kakashi Sensei
and Bushier Brow Sensei!

 You know I can't just sit back
and relax

 while my student from Team 7
is working hard!

 Oh! Him! He's got a Sharingan
and a Rinnegan

 and his left eye and right eye
…and…and…!

 Calm down.

 I don't understand a word
you're saying!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Four Tails,
the King of Sage Monkeys"

 Naruto, just because we're here
doesn't mean you can breathe easy!


 FOUR TAILS,
THE KING OF SAGE MONKEYS


 Tune in again!


 Stop! Why would you do this? Let's test these outside,
shall we? These eyes… see the darkness
quite well… I wonder if Sasuke and Karin
are okay? I wouldn't waste time
thinking about that. Why? Say that Karin and Sasuke
are alive and well… And you and I find them. Do you really think it'll be
a touching emotional reunion? See… Karin wants to get
hot and heavy with Sasuke. Which means the two of us
will be in the way. I see… So what'll we do? Keep gathering blades? We'll meddle, of course! That's what I enjoy most,
next to gathering swords. So we're going to look
for Sasuke and Karin? First, let's go check out
Orochimaru's hideout! Four Tails, the King of
Sage Monkeys


 You came, Kakashi Sensei!
Bushier Brow Sensei! You know I can't just sit back
and relax while my student from Team 7
is working hard! Oh! Him! He's got a Sharingan and a Rinnegan that are linked,
left eye to right eye…and…! And there's a rod sticking out of
the left side of the chest…and…! Calm down.
You're not making sense. The right eye is Sharingan. The left eye is Rinnegan. And he has the same rod
Pain had in his left chest. So I see. Gotta hand it to you, Kakashi. Your skills of deduction
are impressive! Here it comes! From the number of tails…
It's Five Tails! Leaf Rock Crush! Hey, thanks! He's after the Eight Tails! Sorry, Eight-o! You okay? We share pain, remember? What about you? You okay, Bee? He tried to attack him? So painful…! Huh?! How can I let a bastard
like him do this to me…? Why you…! There! He did it! Why would he suppress
the Tailed Beast's powers? I don't know… He doesn't seem to
have the Tailed Beast completely under his control. Maybe that's why… Hey, did you hear
that voice, Naruto? I heard it. That was the Tailed Beast…
Five Tails' voice. We Tailed Beasts have emotions. It pisses me off to see one of
my kind treated like that! Ouch! Now you get mad? It's always been the same
with every shinobi who has kept us as pets! Eight Tails…you and that brat Bee
are a special exception. I wonder about that Nine Tails… Huh? Nine Tails can talk to Eight Tails? I know all about it, Nine Tails. – You…
– You talk too much! By the way, Eight Tails, given the number of tails
you have, aren't you the next
most powerful after me? Hurry up and finish this! I'm going to take a nap! Don't decide who's stronger
based on the tail count! You've always been like this! That's why that Tanuki
One Tail really hates you! Are you even listening, you fool?! Don't you dare play possum,
you fox! Eight Tails and Nine Tails
are arguing… Through telepathy
the Tailed Beasts speak… It's not only rare,
but an amazing feat! What're you mumbling about,
Naruto?! The enemy's approaching! Just because I'm here doesn't
mean you can breathe easy! Right! We need to confirm which one
is going to use which one of Pain's jutsu! Got it, Guy? I'm not good at
remembering faces… And they all look the same to me… Lightning Blade! Eight Inner Gates! Sixth Gate of Joy, Open! Three are headed your way, Naruto! They're here! Three is better than what
we faced before… I'm serious now too, hard core! Chakra Absorption… Summoning… Magnetic Pull and Repulsion… Chakra Extraction… Puppetry… What's going on? They're not using any of those! Why?! They're not using any
of Pain's jutsu! Maybe…they can't. Maybe he's shrewd enough
not to waste any chakra on Pain's jutsu since we already
know how to counter them! Yeah. In order to control
six Tailed Beasts with just his Visual Prowess, he must use an enormous amount
of chakra. Gotta hand it to you,
Kakashi Sensei! There's your deductive skill again! Kakashi Hatake… He's got very discerning eyes. Well then… I'll just power it up a little. Next up, two beasts. Damn it,
I'll have to use Nine Tails' Chakra Shadow Clones
to create a diversion… and attack the masked guy head on! You can't use any more
Nine Tails' chakra for Shadow Clones! Nine Tails will take
your own chakra… And you'll drop dead Then you'll be seeing red! Bee, haven't you noticed yet? I thought you bumped fists
with him! Given the number of clones
he's already produced, Naruto should have been
half-dead a while back. Seeing as he's not means that
Nine Tails stopped taking Naruto's chakra sometime ago. Right, Nine Tails? Although I don't know
what happened between you two… You know, Nine Tails… I'm coming after all that hate
inside you, too, some day! Who the hell are you to decide… that having a Tailed Beast
inside me makes me unhappy?! What the heck is that?! Whatever you do,
don't let it touch you, Guy! Naruto! We gotta help him! Guy, we have to deal
with this side first! This is bad too! We're being surrounded! The tree wilted instantly! Is it a corrosive gas? I'm worried about
how much chakra I have left, but I have no choice. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Guy… We have to guard
each other's back and focus only on
what's in front of us. Any complaints?! Nope! Lightning Cable! Sixth Gate of Joy, Open! Asakujaku! Here comes the next wave! Same here! Let's wrap this up and help Naruto! Let Naruto go, you monkey! Nine Tails… I think you gave some
of your chakra to the Naruto's clone who was
fighting the other Madara. You should lend this one
strength too before it's too late. I'm not like you, Eight Tails. I won't wag my tails each and
every time for my Jinchuriki… Don't you care what happens
to Naruto?! Nine Tails… This transient form is nothing more
than a nodule. You're only a piece of yourself. Shut up. You are just an ignorant
unstable power… Shut up. Those who shall guide
you are the Uchiha. You Tailed Beasts are
simply servants of those with Visual Prowess! Shut the hell up! Obey! Nine Tails… Your power is too great. Regrettably, I cannot
let you run loose. No matter what words they use… When you exert your power,
you draw hatred to you. Please stay quiet inside me. Humans all say… This is unfortunate for both of us… You may be here to keep
the world in check, but I'm here to watch you. …the same thing. And now, it's this brat? How dare these shinobi… I'll bet even he… You know, Nine Tails… I'm coming after all that hate
inside you, too, some day! Naruto! What the—?! Now you want to take my power too? Coming all the way in here…
you obnoxious brat! A-Are you… Four Tails?! Don't call me "Four Tails"! I have a proper name! I am the handsome
Monkey King of Suirendo, the King of Sage Monkeys, bestowed with
the priestly title "Son" from the Sage of Six Paths! The Great Monkey
Equal of Heaven, Son Goku! Huh? Uh…
Which one's your name? It's Son Goku! You humans are all stupid! You can't even get
a name straight! You are all lesser than apes. I don't want to give my power
to likes of such… So where are we? It sorta looks like
Nine Tails' place… Did you hear me, kid?! I told you my name!
Don't you dare ignore me! You're so rude! Huh? Oh… S-Sorry. You're…pretty genuine for a human. It's the first time I've heard someone apologize to
a Tailed Beast. I guess you didn't come to
steal my power, eh? You have one inside you too… That's how you got in… Kurama's trained
his Jinchuriki well. Kurama? Who's Kurama? How can you be
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki and not even know his real name?! That's why humans disgust me! Huh?! The Nine Tails
has a name too?! I see, his name's Kurama! You humans only see us
as sources of power. You don't even care
if we have names, or care to know them. You imprison and deny us
of our existence. Look, it's that boy. Ignore him and keep walking. Who's that boy? You don't need to know. What the—?! That brat! I think I understand a little
about how you feel. I used to misbehave a lot. I just wanted to be scolded. Huh? I'd do anything to get people
to notice me. It was better than being invisible. I'm a Jinchuriki… But I have a proper name
I cherish…Naruto. It's a memento from
my parents and master. That's why… I'm nobody.
I don't want to be anybody. I just want to fulfill
Project Tsuki no Me. I can't stand a guy like that who
doesn't even care who he is… It's not worth living in this world
where only despair exists. ...is forcing you to do
whatever he wants. Well then, what do you
want to do with us? Like Octopops… I'd like to be like Octopops
and Eight Tails. Huh? When I watch him joke around
with Eight Tails, and fight, and console each other… They're like friends. And I always have this feeling… I… I really envy them. Aw c'mon! Don't tell me… A human like you seriously
wants to be friends with a Tailed Beast?! Huh? This guy… He's dead serious… That's why I want to help
you too… Umm… What was your name again? Just call me Son… By the way, I ate you.
What're you gonna do? Oh, yeah! What'll I do?! Hmmm… He seems better than
the guy in the mask… There is a way to stop me. Undo these chains and you'll see. Son! I don't trust Jinchuriki on principle.

 Especially fools who that claim

 they want to be friends
with Tailed Beasts.

 You really think that if
you set me free,

 I will be your ally?

 That's a response to be expected…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Nine Tails"


 Humans just want to imprison us!


 NINE TAILS


 Tune in again!

 By the way, I ate you…
What are you gonna do?! Oh yeah, what'll I do? There is a way to stop me. Undo these chains
and I'll tell you. Son! You have to tell me
how to stop you. First, just one thing… I don't trust Jinchuriki on principle. Especially fools like you who claim they want to be friends
with Tailed Beasts. In other words… Don't think that if you set me free, I'll be your ally. That's a response to be expected… Nine Tails… This transient form is nothing
more than a nodule. You're only a piece of yourself. Shut up… You are just an ignorant unstable power… Shut up! Those who shall guide
you are the Uchiha. You Tailed Beasts are simply servants
of those with Visual Prowess. Shut the hell up! Obey! Nine Tails… Your power is too great. Regrettably, I cannot let
you run loose. When you exert your power,
you draw hatred to you. Please stay quiet inside me. This is unfortunate for both of us… You may be here to keep
the world in check, but I'm here to watch you. Even though you have no strength you force your ideals on me
to restrain me. Okay, now for the Eight Trigram Seal… I'm going to seal Nine Tails
in Naruto. Does he intend to seal me again? Into that brat? Kushina! Are you okay? Stop it! Eight Trigram Seal… The same thing happened
sixteen years ago… Nine Tails

 Where am I? Seems like I'm inside that kid…
What's this? An Eight Trigram Seal? I see. The Fourth Hokage plans on letting
this brat use my power… Even if half of my existence
has been sealed away, he underestimates me. Me…! The very one those Jinchuriki had
to go so far to restrain. This seal is nothing. Even so, this will take a while to break. But if I keep sending chakra
through the cracks, it'll eventually weaken… Fine, this is no fun,
but I need to do it to get out. I'll give this brat power. You did terrible in today's taijutsu class. Don't come to school, loser.
I hate looking at you. You'll never become a ninja
in a hundred years. Shut up! I'll make you pay for that. Come and get me! You'll regret saying that! Ouch… Damn it! How long is he going
to make me wait? If you don't use your power,
my seal won't weaken. I'll show you one day! He's… Naruto Uzumaki from
the Village Hidden in the Leaves… Iruka… I said I'd get to you later,
but I changed my mind. Hurry up and die! Don't lay your hands on Iruka Sensei! I'll kill you! Y-You idiot!
Why did you come out? Run away! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Finally… My chakra is gathering and
taking the form of a fox… Damn it! Take this! For now, the key to getting him
to use my power is when his life is in danger
or when he's emotionally at the brink. But using me unconsciously
still isn't enough. I need him to be conscious
of my existence… and use my power regularly… Thank you for asking me! I'm known as… the immortal Toad Sage
of Mount Myoboku… Call me the Toad Sage! S-Sage? So this is the man who was
the Fourth Hokage's master… He's probably going to pass
on his ideas to the kid and try to control me… Well, for now, this is
a good opportunity for me. What is it?! This is the end of your training. If you don't want to die,
 then handle things on your own. What? The kid's finally come to me. I want to eat and kill you,
but this gate won't open… This bloody seal… You… You're… the Nine Tails! For you to approach me… What business brought you here? Hey! You stupid fox! Since you're staying in my body,
give me your chakra as rent! That's fine… As a reward for making it this far… I'll give it to you! Summoning Jutsu! I did it! I successfully did… – What a fool.
– the Summoning Jutsu! He acts as if my power
is his own… But now, he can clearly
sense my presence and will use my power
even more now… Something with claws and fangs… I won't let you go. Sasuke, I'll… That's right… Keep using my power! The more you rely on my power
and draw chakra from me… the weaker this seal gets. We've just gotten word that
the Hidden Sand's Kazekage has been abducted by
an organization known as Akatsuki. I will now… give my new orders to Team Kakashi. If I'm not mistaken, this kid knows the One Tail's Jinchuriki. This kid has become quite powerful
during his three years of training. But that also means that I'll be able to influence things
more than before. Now then… I'll pummel him. So that's what Master Jiraiya
 was talking about… If this is all it takes to
make him go on a rampage… that means the seal has
become pretty weak. Just a little longer… If I can draw out even
greater hatred from this kid… I can send in my power
and destroy the seal. Just a little while longer… SEAL Don't talk about Sasuke,
 in front of me, like you own him! He's directing so much hatred
at him. Kid, do you hate him?
Do you want him to disappear? In that case, come here and
I'll give you power. Chidori Stream! This is your chance, Naruto… Show him our power. So… Who do you want to kill? Don't come out anymore.
I don't need your power! You refuse now, but who was it that came crawling to me
every time to use it? You should know by now… You know that you can't
do anything on your own. How will you face powerful foes
without my power? This world shall know pain… Hinata! Undo the seal. If you do, I'll give you all of my power. Destroy everything. Erase everything that hurts. Give me your soul. I will save you from your suffering. Come this way… Come… And rip this seal off! FOURTH HOKAGE You're…! I'll rebuild the seal… However, this is the last time. I never expected to be
sealed back again by a ghost. But I still have a chance. To think, he'd just come right in
with the key. Now, if I just take control
of that kid's mind, I can break free anytime I want. What did you say? Where did the real you go?
I can't sense you! I'm right here…
right in front of you! SEAL I see… You plan on controlling
my power. You teamed up with Eight Tails! How pathetic of
the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki! Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan! So fast! Do you think you
can beat me? Why would I break
the seal otherwise? Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! You can't control my power! You are just a small portion
of my hatred! This chakra… Kushina, is that you? Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan Super Barrage! Don't underestimate me! Sage Art! Massive Rasengan…Barrage! One more round! What kind of power is this? Go! You've angered me! Naruto! This is the Six Paths…?! You watch out…Naruto. Damn it! How could this
happen to me again?! He took quite a lot of
power from me… Even though…
Even though he's just… Just what is he? We won't trust you.


 Naruto, I've watched you
all these years.


 You should already know.


 It doesn't matter what you tell me…
or us Tailed Beasts.


 Your true feelings
won't be transmitted to us.


 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kurama" In the end,
it's always the same… KURAMA Tune in again! Kurama You're always so careless
with my chakra… It's not like you to start up a conversation,
Nine Tails. I know you're starting to
get lonely and want to talk… but I'm busy now!
Let's do this later! Do you seriously think you can
end this war by yourself? We'll talk after the war's over. Later. If your comrades are killed,
hatred will arise. Are you planning to
defeat the enemy before that happens? And if you defeat the enemy, they'll bear hatred towards you… Do you honestly think you can take all of that
on by yourself? Don't keep underestimating me. You don't understand a thing! You're naïve! Can you honestly take on and
erase everyone's hatred?! The war has already begun. There must be a considerable
amount of casualties already. And the resulting hatred to match… First of all, Sasuke who used to
stand alongside you, has been gripped by hatred
for a long time. Have you ever been able
to do anything for him? In other words… Regardless of who
you're dealing with, you can neither erase their hatred
nor take it on yourself! So… Are you done? What? Hey… You're the one who's naïve! How can you be so confident when you couldn't even
save Sasuke? Once you question
your own beliefs, it's over. I will help Sasuke somehow, and I will do something
about this war! The little brat thinks
he's all grown up, does he? Ya know, Nine Tails, I… I'm going to come after all that hate inside you
as well some day! You've put me through
a lot of pain, but I know that
it doesn't feel good to be at the mercy of hatred… Are you stupid?! I'm the Nine Tails! Some little brat
can't change me! I am hatred! Then it's okay! I'm no longer
a little brat and it will be more
challenging this way! Later! So cocky. We don't trust you… If you want our trust… It's fine. I have a pretty good idea of
what I need to do anyway. Naruto… I've seen all
that you've done. So you should know by now. No matter what you say to me,
to us Tailed Beasts… It doesn't matter. Your true feelings won't
be transmitted to us. Are you departing? Yes. The battle here is winding down. And we've tended to all
the serious cases. The first and second units
have already gone on to aid other companies. We must go as well to
support Naruto and Bee. I'll have to leave
their care to you. We non-combatants can
take care of the wounded. But I'm more worried
about Naruto and the others. The battle there is
far more intense than here. Yes, I know. But…he's always… Sakura, are you ready? Yes! Please be careful. Please take care of everything. All right.
I pretty much know what to do. Okay then, I'll be going for a while! Quickly! That damn Madara's sniffed out
your location. Unlock the noose
Gotta let Naruto loose So you were here. I'll drag both you and
Four Tails into me. This isn't good. Open your mouth! Naruto, get out! I've got to get outta here! It's not opening. It's not gonna work like this. Umm… umm… I have to make him throw me up… Throw up… From overeating… Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Didn't expect so many Naruto
on the plate He's smart to make
him expectorate All right! I made it out! Now then… Listen! Take a good look
at the base of my neck. There's a rod stuck into it. That's where the chakra
chain binds us. It's the chain of the demon statue
that Rinnegan Gedo uses. Huh? It's not on the chest? The Jinchuriki had it
on their chests. It's because we expand in size when we undergo
Tailed Beast Transformation… The rods migrate to
the base of our necks. And being bigger makes it
difficult to find. You just don't know
when to give up… Just pull that rod out. Then the chakra chain won't form! Damn, where is it? Found it! That's it! And the chain binding me
should disappear. But it won't be easy. I'll be controlled and unable
to stop from attacking. Yeah, I know. Things might get rough,
but you have to bear with me. Don't go overboard and
end up killing me! I can't keep up this mode
much longer. I may as well just
push it to the limits! Here it is! Do it, Naruto! Why you—! It's working! Damn Naruto… It's not going to go that easily. What the hell is this…? My power… Those rods bind anything
that touches them. They're stronger restraints than
Nagato Pain's Gedo Powers! Naruto! One problem after another! It has enough binding force
to restrain us Tailed Beasts… So how will you move? It's over, Naruto Uzumaki! In the end, it's always the same. I'm gonna be the Hokage some day. You just watch! I'm gonna take over as
Hokage some day. And I'll be stronger than
all the previous Hokage. And… And I'm gonna make
everyone in the village acknowledge my power! The graduation exam will be
to make a clone jutsu. Multi Shadow Clone? Aw man, why? Why? A jutsu I'm not good at?! Shadow Clone Jutsu. Heroes? That's so stupid. There's no such thing as heroes. I'll prove it. I'll prove that there
are heroes in this world. Sorry I was late. Heroes are supposed
to come running in at the knick of time. I'm definitely going to win. That's the destiny of those born
to become Hokage. You can't just try and become it. It's something that Fate decides. I won't run away… I'll go forward… I won't go back on my word… Well then, show me that
what you're saying is true. Sure thing…
I'll beat you and prove it! So you decided to be a mentor and teach him a jutsu
he can't even learn? Don't give him any ideas. That's why this brat
who loves to dream, started bragging that he's going
to become the Hokage. The brat thinks everything
is easy. That's why he can talk about
such a ridiculous dream. That's why he won't give it up… And…he'll die. Until I become Hokage… I'll…never die! Rasengan! Someone like you
who has no answer… should give up! Give up… …on me giving up! Rasengan! Don't mess with me! It's far too late for me
to believe Jiraiya's words! There's no such thing
as true peace! As long as we live
in this cursed world, that is impossible! Then… Then…I'll break that curse. If there is such a thing
as peace, I'll seize it! I'll never give up! You… That's… Those…words… That's right. They're taken straight from this book. The first novel written
by Pervy Sage. At the end of this book, he wrote about a student
who inspired him. It was you, Nagato. No… And… the name of the hero
in this novel… is… …is Naruto! Welcome back! We believed in you! Naruto, you did well. Welcome home! Naruto! Ya know, Nine Tails, I… I'm going to come after all that hate inside you
as well some day! That's why I want to help you too… Naruto… If you're absolutely serious and truly wish to do something
for us Tailed Beasts, keep doing what
you've been doing… Not yet… All right! Hope you can sense this okay! The real me is outside…
right about here. I did warn you that
I might have to get rough. Hope you understand. We're going to push
the rod out from the inside! Keeping doing what
you've been doing all along and prove yourself
through your actions! Naruto… That's who you are! Frog Slap! It's loose! That's right,
that's the Naruto I know. Let's go, Octopops!


 We'll fight as a two-man team
with me as the lead!


 Naruto, you just be
my back-up, agreed?


 Both you and Eight-o
are hurt,


 so there isn't going to be
any leading or backing up!


 We're going in together!


 Especially since we're both
already in two-man teams.


 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Two-Man Team"


 Hold on Naruto, don't tell me… TWO-MAN TEAM Tune in again! Two-Man Team


 Damned Naruto!
He pulled out the rod! In that case… Rasengan! You did it! What?! Why are
the chains still here?! Heh… I guess this chain through
my belly won't disappear… Why?! I pulled out the rod,
just like you said. That rod just temporarily binds
my chakra to the Jinchuriki's body. But my chakra itself is held
by that masked guy through the Gedo Statue. You knew about that?! Then it means that
I haven't saved you! You… You're seriously saying
that for real…? Of course I am! This kid…. He really is serious… I only told you how to stop me. I never told you how to save me. You should have told me
that from the beginning! Why aren't Tailed Beasts
more straightforward?! So what do I have to do?! Before I tell you,
I have something to pass on to you. What is it? Hold out your hand… Huh? You're giving me something? It's something good. It will come in handy
one of these days. Hurry up! What?! The statue reabsorbed Four Tails!
I guess he still belongs to him! You look like you're
about to pass out after stopping
just one Tailed Beast… You can't defy me! I'm going to take your precious
Tailed Beast with these… What's going on?! This is bad,
no matter how you look at it. And you're a mess. Idiot. Just watch me… If you want me to lend you power,
I wouldn't mind doing it, Naruto. You sure are talking to me a lot, lately. I'm glad you want to lend me power, but before you do,
there's something I have to say. Thanks for helping me with
the other Madara back there. That extra power really saved me! Don't thank me!
It's creeping me out! I just did that because I'd rather
deal with you than Madara! Besides, I could only give you
a tiny bit of chakra because of this cage! I just wanted to see you fight
a little more! That's right… Just to pass the time! Hey! Why do have to get mad
when I just thanked you? You don't have to
stop glaring at me, but you could at least work
on your attitude! You're always like—?! Hit your chakra with mine… Are we going to play chakra
tug-of-war again? You idiot… We don't need to do that this time! It's not like I have
anything else to do. So we could if
you really wanted to. Let's do this, Octopops! We fight as a two-man team
with me taking the lead. Naruto, you just be
my back up, agreed? Even so, we're going up
against five Tailed Beasts. You can't be in the front if you can't do
a Tailed Beast Transformation! Both you and Eight-o are hurt, so there isn't going to be
any leading or backing up! We're going in together! Hey… Naruto! Especially since we're both already
in two-man teams… Hold on, Naruto… Don't tell me…
You and the Nine Tails… I've still got tons
of reserve power! You don't approve of me! I don't approve of the monster fox… But, not Naruto… For him,
I have nothing but respect. He's an excellent student… He works with all his might. But despite that, he's clumsy
and not everyone approves of him. He already knows about the pain
in peoples' hearts. That boy is no longer
the demon fox. He is…a citizen of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves. He's Naruto Uzumaki. You're no longer the monster fox… You are a partner of a citizen
from the Hidden Leaf… Kurama! Come on, let's do this! Naruto… Don't tell me you… Th-This is really bad! Guy, don't move! I'm going to blow them away
with my left eye with Kamui! There's so many of them! It's impossible with
Visual Prowess alone! In that case,
I'll open up the Eight Gate… You idiot!
You'll die after you do that! But still… Naruto! Looks like they're
in trouble over there! There are five Tailed Beast Bombs
pointed at them at close range! I know about it…y'know! What was that?! So fast! S-Sensei?! I-Is that, Naruto?! The mountain… So this is the power of
the Tailed Beasts! He deflected them all?! In that case… Here they come! Let's go, Kurama! Was Naruto able to do
Tailed Beast Transformation? That Nine Tails… What's going on?! Are we inside
the Nine Tails' chakra?! First, we have to figure out
where all of their rods are! Just to let you know,
we don't have much time here. This is our first Tailed Beast
Transformation, so our link isn't perfect. We can only keep this up
for about five minutes! That's more than enough time. There are more of you, so I can't be as gentle
as I was with Son. So please bear with it, okay? I'm not falling for that same trick twice! Take this! All right! I found out where they all are! This is like an all-out monster
smack down! He exceeded my expectations. I'll have to go after him
with intent to kill. Hey… Don't you think that's pretty big
for one of those things? Are they pooling their power
into a single point?! Naruto, what now?! Is he going to cancel it out
with equal force?! But Naruto's never succeeded
at that before… He managed to do it
by accident during training, but this time, he'll do it for sure. – Tailed Beast Bomb!
– Tailed Beast Bomb! He aimed it low, so it would
bounce them upwards. That was good…
but it was really big! Nine Tails sure is strong… I've got all their rods! Let's do this, Kurama! We're going to pull them out
all at once! We're going to free them all!
And definitely save everyone! We've been waiting for you. Huh? The same thing happened with Son. You did get all the way to this plane…
just as Four Tails said. This isn't where Four Tails was… Now that we're fully linked, you're able to enter deeper into
the Tailed Beast Psyche Plane. Look! There are Jinchuriki here too! Also, Four Tails was bound
by Chakra Chains. I don't really get it, but everyone's here and
there aren't any chains. It's not as crazy as last time! That jerk in the mask cannot
penetrate this deep. Welcome! I thank you on behalf of all of
us Jinchuriki and Tailed Beasts. I've wanted to meet you,
Naruto Uzumaki! To tell you the truth…huh? You look like you're shorter,
younger and weaker than me. You must have had it rough
as a Jinchuriki. Knowing how you went through that… And how you've already passed on… It's just so sad. You never knew
the taste of good ramen… or what it felt like to kiss a girl! – Hey! You've never kissed a girl either!
– I am the Former Fourth Mizukage! – Hey! You've never kissed a girl either!
– I was quite distinguished! – Actually…
– And I'm an adult! you've only kissed Sasuke. No! Don't make me remember that! Hey, you're barfing way too much! What was it like to kiss this Sasuke?! I'm talking to you! Honestly, just as Four Tails said,
you don't listen at all! Four Tails? So, Son was here too? That's right… Finally… So does that mean that
bearded old man was here too? Yup! Make sure to tell him… Also, I was able to give him
just a tiny bit of my chakra. Do you remember what Old Man
Six Paths told us at the very end? I think this kid's it… That's what I felt. I wager he'll probably come here
to save all of you too. Look after that kid when he does. I'm being pulled back
into the statue… Goodbye for now, guys. Four Tails…
This is just hypothetical, but… Do you think we could have
traveled down a different path too? This coming from you, who's even more stubborn
than Tsuchikage Ohnoki? Have you gone soft after death? Well… maybe if you had tried
to remember my name, right when you became
my Jinchuriki… I haven't softened enough to
start calling you by your name, after being your Jinchuriki
for over forty years… But I haven't forgotten it either! In that case, say my full name,
spiel and all. Is just "Son" good enough? We assembled here on
Four Tails' summons… and hung around after promising
to tell, and give you, something. I see… He did all that? I'm glad that you're all gathered
together and getting along! That only happened after
Four Tails and Roshi left here. It's all thanks to you, Naruto. Naruto, step forward and
extend your hand… We shall now fulfill our promise
to Four Tails…rather Son Goku. My name is Matatabi. Yugito Ni'i… My name is Isobu.
We've met before, huh! I'm Yagura,
the former Fourth Mizukage. I am Kokuo. I'm Han. Me, I be called Saiken. You already know me, I'm Utakata. I'm Luck Seven Chomei. I'm Fu! I will not live much longer… Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu,
Son Goku, Kokuo, Saiken, Chomei, Gyuki, and Kurama… Even if you are far apart,
you will always be together. There will come a time when
you will be united again. Each of you with a unique name….
and a different form than before. And unlike when you were inside me, you will be guided down
the right path. I hope you learn what true strength is… Before that time… It's taken way too long, Old Man. Don't you all agree?
That Naruto's the Old Man's… Yes! Yup! Yeah! Indeed… For sure… Well done, Naruto! I never thought you'd be able to
completely control Nine Tails. However, it looks like you still
can't maintain it for too long. So same old, same old. It's not the same old, same old… I just learned a whole bunch
of hard names all at once! Naruto gaining such experience
and strength

 makes me feel old and feeble.

 You're not being yourself!

 The springtime of our youth
is still far from over!

 We still have a lot of…

 Quiet! Do you want to make me
feel even worse?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Promise of Victory"

 That's the Guy I know! THE PROMISE OF VICTORY


 Tune in again!

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,830
Aren't you being a little too laid back? Oh, well you know, things were
pretty tense around here recently with the incident in the Sand Village. But now that it's been settled... I'm suddenly overcome
with exhaustion... Even so, we don't know
what's going to happen next. Only by being cautious at all times
are we able to prevent... You won't last if
you remain cautious at all times. Come on, relax, relax! It's not good to tease weak ones. I set the alarm clock
before I went to bed last night, and here, I get up before
the alarm goes off. I can't bring myself to turn off
the alarm. But if I don't,
then the annoying ring won't stop. It's such a pain just thinking
about this whole thing! Seconds! What is that? Move, move, move! Last spurt! Goal! First place! Sadly, second place! - What kind of race is that?
- Beats me... Hey Lee, you need to train more. Yes! I will try to be first place next time. But, there is regrettable news. Wh-What is it? Lee, you are not second place. You are...third place! Huh?! Second place is Kakashi,
whom I am carrying! Kakashi, you are too lucky!
You don't need to thank me. I feel like I learned another
important lesson from you. As usual, I can't keep up
with their craziness. Although we did run along after them. Ridiculous! Okay, everyone's here, eh?! Then let's go report to
Lady Tsunade right away. Um, Guy Sensei... What is it? Kakashi Sensei is... Huh? Oh! Guess it's the hospital before reporting. <i>The New Target


</i> Oh! He's awake! So I'm back here again... Good job, Kakashi. Master... Lady Tsunade... No, Kakashi Sensei!
Don't push yourself. I examined you earlier,
but you need to be in bed for a week. It will take a few more days
until you can return to duty. I guess that's how it goes... Seems it will still take a while until
you can master the new Sharingan. Yes... Just rest. Try not to push yourself
for a while. Team Guy should rest today too.
You can turn in the report later. Yes! Let's go, Shizune. Yes. Oh...Master! Is it regarding that matter? Yes. Did you tell Kakashi? Since Kakashi Sensei has been
like that all this time, I haven't yet... How about Naruto? I thought I should first consult you... Give me the details. It's what I heard from
the Akatsuki member, Sasori. He said it was a reward for beating him... <i>In ten days,
<i>go to the Tenchi Bridge</i> <i>located in the Village Hidden
<i>in the Grass at high noon.</i> <i>I've got a spy working as one of
<i>Orochimaru's subordinates...</i> <i>I was supposed to rendezvous...
<i>with him...there...</i> In ten days...at Tenchi Bridge, huh... Four days has passed,
so it will be in six days. Can you trust your source? Considering the situation,
it's safe to say we can trust it. What would you do if it were a trap? There is a possibility that
Orochimaru is just bait, and the Akatsuki will
be waiting there. If it is a trap,
I'll fight with all my might! Fight? Kakashi will be in bed
for more than a week. But we only have six days left. For that matter, ever since Sasuke left,
Team Kakashi has been short on staff. Yes... We can only add another member
and create a new team. Lady Tsunade! What is it? Then, you should send a different unit
to investigate the situation. Even if you let Sakura go,
you should leave out Naruto! Shizune... Yes. Like you, Sakura is
one of the few Ninja whom I can trust from
the bottom of my heart. I will definitely let Team Kakashi go,
mostly because Sakura is on it. Wouldn't it be the same
if my team went? It's not the same! Sakura and Naruto are both
desperately trying to seek out Sasuke,
their former team mate... They wish to save Sasuke
more than anyone. That strong desire will
lead the mission to success. You and Sakura are different... I understand, but,
for this mission, Naruto should... Now that he's heard this...
what would Naruto say? Let's search for our new team
member immediately! Later! Sheesh, that impatient brat...
I wasn't done talking yet. <i>He has a mysterious power...</i> <i>Everyone...starts wanting
<i>to place their bets on him.</i> <i>Becoming Hokage...is my dream...!</i> <i>The child who was entrusted
<i>with the First Hokage's necklace...</i> <i>Indeed, Naruto might not
<i>be an ordinary kid.</i> <i>Sasuke...</i> Hmm, who might be good? I need to think about this
very carefully. It would be a pain if I mistakenly choose someone
who would slow me down. Plus, even if the person is skillful, there might be a problem
with their personality, and that will ruin the teamwork. And Sakura is a sucker
for handsome boys, so it would be dangerous
if he were too good-looking. This is hard. Long time no see, Naruto. Huh? Who are you? It's me. Huh? Even though we haven't
seen each other for a long time, you should remember
your comrade's face. Because the one that spoke
to you will feel bad. Oh...um...that really indirect speech...
could it be...? Shino! You finally remembered. If you cover up that much,
no one will know-- Shino, you're here early! Are you Kiba? Oh! This smell! It <i>is</i>  Naruto! You knew it was me 'cause of that? That dog, could it be... What are you talking about? Of course, it's Akamaru! Huh?! Hey, did you grow?! Naw, naw, naw...
Akamaru is the one that grew. Do dogs become that big
in such a short amount of time? Really? Since we're always together,
I can't really tell. Can't tell?! That Akamaru,
he used to be on your head! Right, Shino?! Seems like you noticed Kiba right away,
didn't you, Naruto? <i>Oh shoot, he's upset.</i> Na... <i>N-Naruto...</i> <i>I heard that he came back
<i> to the village.</i> <i>Wh-What should I do?</i> <i>I'm not ready yet since we haven't
<i>seen each other for a while.</i> <i>What should I say...?</i> <i>Um... Um...</i> Oh, it's Hinata! Why are you hiding? Huh?! Hinata. Hey, Hinata, hey, Hinata! Why do you always faint
after seeing Naruto? Please! We need a new member! <i>Huh?</i> You came at the wrong time, we just got a mission and
we're waiting for Kurenai Sensei. <i>What...I...?</i> But you have Akamaru,
so lend us one person. Come on, Kiba? <i>What happened...?</i> What are you talking about?! If I don't go I can't use
the combo attack with Akamaru! <i>Oh yeah, I met Naruto and...</i> Oh that's right.
Then, then... Hey, Shino is... You noticed Hinata
right away too, Naruto. <i>He is still sulking...</i> Forget it!
You guys are all lousy friends! <i>Naruto's voice...</i> Hinata! Just shut up and
come with me! <i>"Just shut up and come with me"...?</i> <i>No way... no way... so suddenly...</i> After all that fuss, I still got rejected. In that case...
I guess I'll ask those guys. Hey, Hinata, Kurenai Sensei
is going to be here soon. Wake up! Hey, Shino! Do you have water?
Water! <i>The sky...is blue.</i> I told you already, haven't I? It's annoying, but I'm in charge
of the Chunin Exam. I mean, yeah, we have
a long history together, so I want to lend a hand. But I'm not in a position
to do whatever I want. The Fifth appointed me,
so she will kill me if I reject the offer. I get scolded enough by my mother. And here I was thinking
"I can count on Shikamaru," but you go on talking like
it's so annoying and all... Even if you look at me
with those puppy eyes, what's impossible is impossible. Then I will lend a hand! Here! Shikamaru. This is the lunch box that
your mom asked me to hand you. Choji! Hey Choji, are you sure you can say
such an irresponsible thing? Don't you have a mission
with Asuma and Ino? I can't ignore what Naruto is saying. I will try to discuss it
with Asuma Sensei. Choji, thanks! It's not going to help if you tell Asuma because
he works under Lady Tsunade. Well, I will try to talk to him.
Here's the lunch box. Oh! Thanks! Hey, Naruto...
That's my lunch box. Just like always,
you're still eating, huh? You...are fatter than before... Oh! Shikamaru! Behind! Over there, huh...? I haven't seen him before,
but he wears a Leaf head band. It was so sudden... I don't know what he is aiming for,
but we need to capture him and... give him to the Interrogation Unit! I'll assist you! Go Naruto! Right! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll. Indeed, Naruto is a Jinchuriki. There is no guarantee that the Akatsuki
who seeks Naruto's Nine-Tailed Beast won't become a huge disaster
for the Hidden Leaf. However, Naruto will someday become
a valuable Ninja to the Hidden Leaf Village. If perchance, the Hidden Leaf Village
and the Land of Fire become endangered by my decision, then as the Fifth Hokage,
I will protect them with my life! Next Time:
Formation! New Team Kakashi Tailed Beast Counting Song!
All right, here we go! One, "sleep is better than humans,"
says Shukaku. ONE TAIL SHUKAKU / GAARA

Five, always on the run, Kokuo. Six, taking it easy and
not in a hurry, Saiken. SIX TAIL SAIKEN / UTAKATA

Seven, the flying leaf insect, Chomei. Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki. EIGHT TAIL GYUKI / KILLER BEE

Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki. Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama. NINE TAIL KURAMA / NARUTO UZUMAKI

Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama. All the Tailed Beasts have
finally come together. They're a little hard,
but they're nice names. They're all splendid names. They're all wonderful names. Next up, the Jinchuriki!
Here we go! GAARA

One, with terrible bags
under his eyes, Gaara. YUGITO NI'I

Two, with a silky voice like a cat, Yugito. YAGURA

Three, the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura. ROSHI

Nine, the Leaf's Naruto Uzumaki. All the powerful Jinchuriki
have finally come together. Can they become friends
with the Tailed Beasts? They're all splendid shinobi. They're all wonderful shinobi. The Promise of Victory – Heave…ho!
– Heave…ho! Hey, did you hear? What? Rumor is that Madara appeared
at the other battlefields. Madara? We're at war with him,
so that's nothing unusual. No! I'm not talking about that
shady-looking masked Madara. They're saying the real one appeared! What?! What do you mean, "real one"? Are you saying, that all this time,
he's been a fake? No, what I mean is… A super strong one, just like the real Madara Uchiha
has appeared! And he's strong enough
to take on the Five Kage. Take on the Five Kage? Give me a break. It's true! From what I heard, he hurled down meteorites
and created a jungle instantly. Above all, he's a giant…
tens of meters tall. A giant?! Well, they're just rumors… Will you two cut it out?! Sure, the enemy's numbers
have dwindled. But we need to hunt down
the remaining enemy. We're on a mission here. Get serious! Focus on the enemy,
here and now! S-Sorry… You're right! We weren't able to show
our stuff at this battle. We'll show 'em on
the next battlefield! Okay. I'll pursue the enemy on the left! You guys go to the right and
stop any remnants there! Roger! – Let's go!
– Yeah! Another one bites the dust. Hey! I'm the one that got him! What? Trying to take
all the credit? Well, all you did was use
a little jutsu at the very end! And that's what did him in! Fine, I'll give you that… But catching one weakling
is nothing to brag about. Yeah… Eight Trigrams: Air Palm! Watch out, you two! Are you all right?! You saved us… The battle here finally ended. If we were to get killed
when it was all over… We were about to be humiliated… The next battle is going
to be on the front lines. SHINOBI The Five Kage are
holding back Madara. Sending Kakashi and Guy
out ahead seems to have worked. However, Naruto and the others
on the front line are under pressure. Once the other battles wind down,
they'll rush to lend support. Are you all right?! Y-Yes… I'm sorry. Compared to the others fighting
on the battlefield, I have it easy, and yet… No. We have our own kind of tension
that we have to contend with here. Don't be so hard on yourself. This is a critical time for us. I'm okay! All right. Thanks. Listen up, everyone! The war is entering its final stage! We are the central command center
for every company. We cannot afford to make
a single mistake! I can't tell you not to overdo it. But hang in there a bit longer
and do your best! I'm counting on you! There isn't a man
in the Sensory Unit who'd throw in the towel
with something like this! Right, guys?! – Right!
– Right! Neither would we! That goes for us too! Right, Captain Inoichi?! Let's show 'em that
the Communications Unit is tireless! Hmm… Right… But if you get tired,
I'll take over… so it's okay to rest a bit. Huh?! Don't take it easy on us! Just tell us to follow you! You have to learn to
go with the flow! Sorry… I'm not good at
that kind of stuff. That erased the pent-up anxiety
everyone was feeling… and a sense of unity was born
at Headquarters. Headquarters, each battle company, and Naruto and the others fighting
on the front lines. If we can stand united in purpose, our foundation will be unshakeable
and we can overcome this war. Th-This is…?! What happened? – Tailed Beast Bomb!
– Tailed Beast Bomb! The front line at last… Just you wait!
I'll show you my stuff! Huh?! What is that? What's happening?! Isn't that in the direction
of the front line? Huh? L-Look over there. Is that where we're going? Yes… That talk earlier about Madara… Maybe they weren't just rumors. That looks like… something huge… Yeah… Here's our chance
to show 'em. Well done, Naruto! I never thought you’d be able
to completely control Nine Tails. However, it looks like you still can’t
maintain it for too long.  So same old, same old. It's not the same old, same old… I just learned a whole bunch
of hard names all at once! Difficult names? What does that have to do
with anything? You don't know, do you?! I'm not gonna tell you! Naruto gaining
such experience and strength makes me feel old and feeble. What's the matter? You're not being yourself! It may sound funny
coming from me… The springtime of our youth
is still far from over! We still have a lot of… Quiet! Do you want to make me
feel even worse? That's the Guy I know! That expression… Huh? Am I sweating? No, it's just rain. These fools could never
make me sweat. Naruto was always
merely a pawn to test Sasuke. That brat's supposed to be
an amusement. I knew what his limits were. There's no way his power could be
pushing me this hard. So what is it?! What's happened? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter who
or what Naruto is now… After this war is over, there will be no past or future. Nothing that exists now
will matter then! A-Amazing… Did you guys feel that? I can't believe it. There's no doubt.
That is the Nine Tails' power! Yeah… But I sense something…
slightly different. What's the current situation? Naruto Uzumaki is holding back
the Masked Madara with an unbelievable amount
of power. The chakra is unbelievable! He's keeping him at bay. It's just the four of them!
Naruto, Lord Bee, Kakashi and Guy! Inoichi! Relay Naruto's actions directly
into the minds of the reinforcement troops
with everything you've got! Fifteen seconds is all we need! I want to boost everyone's morale
all at once! Those four are giving it their all! I want the rest of us here
to do everything we can too. Convey their resolve to everyone! To everyone?! It will overload the Chakra Network. Make one mistake and… You ask for the extreme. Make it ten seconds! Master Inoichi! Sorry, but this is critical! Make it short,
but make it count! I'm not good with words,
but you can count on me! Message from HQ! We have the upper hand at
the battle reinforcement point! Naruto Uzumaki is standing firm! The ones we must protect at all costs,
Naruto and Lord Bee… are fighting with everything
they've got on the front line! Guy and Kakashi are there too! To everyone in the Allied Force… I need all of you to add to
their mighty hearts! Amplify it with your mighty hearts! I promise you, victory is now! I'm bad with words, after all. It took me 20 seconds. Captain… Yeah… That just shows how mighty
your heart is… Sorry… Naruto… I've run, and run after you
my whole life. And I'm still running after you. But when this war is over. I'm going to stop running. I'll stand with you.
I'll hold your hand. And I'll walk with you by your side. So please wait for me! Naruto… I marked you as
my rival ages ago. Hang tight against Madara,
until I get there! I'll support you completely
with my ninjutsu, Naruto. And a reason…
is not necessary! Naruto is doing a good job. I can't see him being
anything other than reckless. But despite his looks,
he's a pretty sharp guy. People thought Naruto was dumb
and I was fat. But that really wasn't the case! Wait for me, smart Naruto! Skinny Choji is coming to help you! He's not the type to strategize calmly. That's what I'm here for. So you just wait, Naruto.
I'll be right there! Thank you, Dad! You transmitted Naruto's mighty heart
to everyone. That promise must be fulfilled! I wonder if Guy Sensei is all right?! I hope he's protecting Naruto! Kakashi Sensei is there too. I think they'll manage, but… If it wasn't raining, we could have flown on
my Super Beast Scrolls. Stop complaining, Sai.
Pick up your speed! We must follow Master Guy
and Naruto's examples. This is the time for us
to exceed ourselves! Uh-huh… This is camaraderie… I have a really good grasp
of it now, Naruto. Naruto… You saved the Hidden Leaf. And now, you are trying to
save the shinobi world. And we've always, always put
the burden on your shoulders. But this time,
no matter what you say… you'll have help. Not just me. This time,
we'll all fight together! We should find Sasuke before
we get mixed up in this war! Suigetsu, why are you here? Are you in Team Hawk just to cause trouble
with Sasuke and Karin. I would love to break
those two losers up for good! I can't help it! You're reprehensible,
you know that? Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Eyes That See in the Dark" I hate you all. EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK Tune in again! What is it? I see… Lots and lots of shinobi? According to these birds… It's a war, right? We should find Sasuke before
we get mixed up in this war. Eyes That See in the Dark


 Hidden Leaf Home Watch
Unit 1 reporting. We've completed patrol
of the eastern sector. No incidents to report. Hidden Leaf Home Watch
Unit 2 reporting. We've completed patrol
of the western sector. No incidents to report. Unit 1 will now patrol
the northern sector. Unit 2 will head for
the southern sector. Do your best, Konohamaru. You too, Watase. It feels like we're in the battle
and it's sort of exciting. Yeah, this feels real. Hey! This is not a game! If wrestlers and boxers
show up again, we have to protect
the Hidden Leaf Village! Got it?! – Yeah!
– Yeah! You bastard! I'll kill you! What was that voice, Konohamaru? INTEL DIVISION


You're gonna pay! That's the Intel Division over there. I get it. It's the prisoner. Prisoner? Who? Sasuke's partner… from the group called Akatsuki
or Taka or something. I'll never forgive you! Let's go. It'll all be okay! Die, you bastard! But you're so handsome! But how dare you try to kill me! Karin… Since you managed
to be taken hostage, you're nothing
but a burden to me. Why that—! Idiot! But I still want you! No… He tried to kill me!
No forgiveness! But he's so handsome! What has she been doing?! It's a hand-drawn picture. She keeps talking to it.
Poor thing… She must've gone through hell. Oh… that picture of Sasuke? Aren't we supposed
to confiscate that? I tried to.
That's when she went nuts. She'll stay calm if
we let her keep it. It's just a picture. That's all. Okay then, why don't we play
a nice, quiet game of cards? Sure. It'd be great if Sasuke
were here at this hideout. This place is special, after all. Orochimaru's favorite spot. Hey, Sasuke… Are you here? The size of this hideout
is ridiculous. What's wrong? Nothing. My head just started hurting. Is he going to go on
a rampage again? Sasuke, Karin and Jugo… Hebi, Taka or whatever… I'm the only normal one among us. Suigetsu… What is it? Something's always bothered me
about you. Oh yeah?! Well, I'm always concerned
about you. You keep me on pins and needles. I'm here because I made
a promise to Kimimaro. Why are you here? Are you in Team Taka just to
cause trouble with Sasuke and Karin? Why? Yeah, why? Why, huh…? I knew it was you. The fact that you're here must
mean you killed Orochimaru. Yeah. But never mind that.
Let's get you out of here. Free at last.
Thank you, Sasuke. Suigetsu, you're the first. Come with me. Me, first? There are others then? Two others. I'm taking Jugo
from the northern hideout and Karin from
the southern hideout. Of course you picked me, but I wonder about
your other two choices, Sasuke. Enough with the rambling.
Put on your clothes. We're going. Can I ask you something? What is it? Why are you recruiting men? I have a goal… And I have a better chance of
achieving it with a small team. Ever since I approached Orochimaru,
I've been waiting for this moment… and I've been selecting highly skilled
shinobi in preparation for it. Oh. Now… I have all the members
I had in mind. So I'll tell you my goal. My goal is to kill Itachi Uchiha
of the Akatsuki. And I want your help for that. Naturally, I won't force you. Karin… You said you had business
to take care of. What will you do? W-Well… On second thought,
it's not that urgent… Karin… Be honest with yourself. Isn't being with Sasuke
all you really want? Th-That's not true!
Whoever said such a thing? That's…! Um …! See, I hit it right on the mark. That's why you're speechless.
So obvious. I know all about it… Long ago…
you had a crush on Sasuke… Suigetsu, don't get Karin
so worked up… I thought I told you
to be cooperative. All right… Sorry Karin, But as much as you hate it,
I'm sticking to Sasuke like glue. At least until I possess one of
the Seven Hidden Mist Blades… the Great Blade, Samehada, of Kisame
Hoshigaki, Itachi Uchiha's partner. Then it's all set! From this point on,
we move together. And henceforth,
we will call ourselves… Hebi. Why? I would love to break those
two losers up for good! I can't help it! I just want to break everything in two! You're reprehensible,
you know that? On that scale,
Sasuke is the worst of all. What? Well, he beat Itachi, so I thought
he had reached his goal already. We are no longer Hebi.
From this day on, we are Taka. Taka has only one goal. We will… destroy the Hidden Leaf! I mean, give me a break… Teaming up with Akatsuki to capture
the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails? He got us mixed up in
one outrageous mission. Are you the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki? No, it's Lord Eight Tails. Okay? Say, "Are you Lord Jinchuriki?" Okay? We are capturing you. Suigetsu, you take the right. Jugo, you take the left. Karin, get behind me. Eight Tails! Sting like a bee! Sasuke! And this is the finishing sting! Sasuke! Let's do this together! The fact is, this guy is super strong. We should go at him as
if we are trying to kill him, instead of trying to take him alive. That way we can probably
take him down without killing him. An ox-octopus monster…
That's his true form? I'll take over from here! Run while you can! Suigetsu… Sasuke! You think I'd let you get away
after what you've done, fool, ya fool! All of us nearly died that day… Somehow, we managed
to finish the job. But next thing we knew, we were crashing
the Five Kage Summit! And we ended up in a battle royale
against Raikage and the rest of them! His attack, huh? No…! Jugo, don't waver.
This is a genjutsu. You may have seen
through the genjutsu, but… it's too late! And when the fist fight was over, he razed the ceiling and
didn't give a damn about us… W-What the hell?! Thanks to him, we ended up as prisoners
in the Land of Iron. I hate all of you! I lead you idiots to water, and you just splash it in
my face instead of drinking it. That's why… Yikes, he's on a rampage! Is he out to kill?! Die! I hate you most of all! Huh?! This is… I've been here lots of times… I never knew this existed. Is this one of…
Orochimaru's secret rooms? Huh? Huh? What? This is… Orochimaru planned
all of this? If so, this intel could change
the outcome of this entire war! What are you doing? This might be a very nice present
for Sasuke. We found something incredible
by chance! Jugo… that punch is
water under the bridge… Snap out of it, Jugo. We've got to find Sasuke quick! The birds are uneasy… Over there. Let's go. You didn't waste any time
coming after me. What are you doing here?! Or not…it seems… I passed by two towns
on my way here, but they were deserted. I thought something
wasn't quite right outside. Do you know anything about it? We asked you a question first! How come you're outside?! What happened to
our original that was with you? If you don't like the fact
that I'm out, why don't you catch me? Especially since you
outnumber me this time. You didn't kill our original,
did you?! With this many of you, I hope it's more of
a challenge this time. Susano'o! Sharingan! It's a war… Take down the enemy. Looks like Madara's started things. Capture Killer Bee and
Naruto Uzumaki. Sasuke… If you attack
the Hidden Leaf, I will fight you. Save your hatred until then. At that time, throw all
of your hatred at me. The only one who can handle
all that hatred…is me! Fine then! I'll kill you first. If you don't hurry… More and more of his friends
will join up with him… one after another. You're someone who knows
the pain of solitude like I do. And that pain makes people stronger. And for that very reason,
by cutting that bond, I will be able to obtain
even greater strength. Have you forgotten, Naruto… What real power is? I feel the Uchiha getting freed
from this rotting shinobi world. And isn't what I'm doing exactly what
you Leaf shinobi have wanted all along? You've always snubbed and
put down the Uchiha. So, I'll help erase the Uchiha
from your memories! I'm going to kill all of you,
all of the Hidden Leaf! Severing all bonds to the Hidden Leaf
is the ultimate purification! And that shall lead to
the Uchiha's true restoration! I'm going to where you are… To cut you down. You're not Hidden Leaf shinobi. You're not part of the promise. These are good eyes. I'm quickly getting used
to them, Brother. When you have the same eyes
as me, come before me. The scenes burned into these eyes…
that once belonged to my brother… are disgustingly sad...
They weigh me down. But that's only fitting.
Just you watch, Brother! There is no shinobi alive today
who is as powerful

 as the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju.

 Everyone says that.

 Just like they think the Sage of
the Six Paths' power

 was also a fairy tale.

 It's time to show them that
all the fairy tales were real!

 No one can stop this Reanimation!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Will of Stone"
 

 I guess I am too old…to do anything!


 A WILL OF STONE
 

 Tune in again!

 Stone Golem! It will pulverize him! Wood Style… Deep Forest Bloom! Damn you! As expected… It's coming closer…
What should we do?! That's…Grandfather's…! Kazekage! I know! What is it? Look at the scale of that! To create a forest in an instant! Everyone, beware of the pollen! Do not inhale it! Not just Deep Forest Emergence… but Deep Forest Bloom as well? How dare that Kabuto! There is no shinobi alive today who is as powerful as the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju. Everyone says that. Just as they think that the Sage of the Six Paths' power
was also a fairytale. It's time to show them that
all the fairy tales were real! Wait, you bastard! You were too distracted by the flowers… N-No! Raikage! Humph… Time to burn things up… Fire Style… Majestic Demolisher! Mizukage! The Will of Stone Water…Style… I guess I am too old…
to do anything! Look, the left side is dirty! That's a precious rock of the Hidden Stone! Buff it more steadily! You need to put more polish
into your polishing! His puns kill me… Hmm? Symbol of our village or not,
it's just a plain old rock. Why don't we have Mountainside Images
like the Hidden Leaf? Lord Tsuchikage is such a cheapskate! Ohnoki… I can tell the value of
a stone just by looking at it. This rock…
symbolizes our village's Will of Stone! It's our bedrock! Don't be such a miser with your words
and use our symbol in your puns! Well… You're right.
This is just an ordinary rock. Whaaaaaat?! W-What's the big idea,
you stupid old man! I can't tell which one it is now! See…if you put a new one
here like this, no one would know. What?! What's important is
the Will of Stone inside you… You see, I can also tell the worth
of someone's will just by looking at them. Ohnoki… Hidden within your will is
the power to change the world. But if you're not careful, that precious will of yours
may disappear… Disappear? Why?! That's not the agreement!
Lord Hashirama said… There is no alliance. Just obey the Hidden Leaf! And… Never mention that shinobi's name
before me again! Susano'o! Barriers! As you keep
running into barriers, you may abandon your will… make excuses and even
replace it with hatred. Listen closely, your will… Never abandon it and
always stride with pride! Seems you still want to keep dancing… But there's no strength left in your step! I'm making excuses… Particle Style:
Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! Look at me being pitiful about my age… I should be excused…
for making an excuse! What's this? Ohnoki! You're all awake! All right! Let's get on with our counterattack! There he is! You dance well. But your step is still too weak. That…looks like
the First Hokage's face! I didn't want to believe it, but… That's why he's able to
use the Wood Style! And this is far different from what Lord Orochimaru developed
with Danzo. The First Hokage was more
powerful than Madara. This fusion of both will be
my ultimate weapon. No one can stop
this Reanimation! Wait! Is that you, Itachi?! I said…wait! Susano'o! This Susano'o… So you are Itachi! I'm surprised that you've been
able to master it too… What are you doing here?! You're supposed to be dead! This is Kabuto's jutsu… I'm a Reanimation now. I can't stop now.
There's something I have to do. I don't care! You're here before me and
I have a lot of questions! Ask me later… But I guess
that's not going to happen. You said so yourself! To come find you once
I had the same eyes as you! So why are you running? To avoid admitting
that you lied to me?! Or don't you have
the courage to tell the truth?! I already know…
everything about you! That's why I decided to destroy
the Hidden Leaf! I told you when we fought… That people live
under false assumptions… I asked if you could think
about it that way. And how one's reality
might be an illusion. Is my truth really— I no longer live
inside an illusion! And I can see through
your genjutsu! These are your eyes! Sasuke understands
your suffering and your resolve! But instead of
carrying on your will, he intends to destroy
the Hidden Leaf! That's his way of getting back
at the village that caused his beloved older brother
so much suffering! You're as confident as ever, but I've heard about you
from others. That you've changed a lot… No! You changed everything
about me! I was supposed to die! You were supposed to kill me
along with our parents. But… So Itachi made his decision. That he would drop the curtain
himself on his own clan's history. He did not betray out of hatred. It was unavoidable. The discrimination by the village… and the object of
their antagonism… He shouldered everything
all by himself. No one can ever question
Itachi's decision and the sacrifice he made. What is this?! Brother! Mother and Father were… Why? Who could have done this? Foolish brother…
Mangekyo Sharingan! Why me?! Why did you spare me?! He just couldn't bring himself
to kill you. Do you know what that means? Why me?! How was I different from
mother and father? Why just me? Because you didn't know anything. You had no part in
the Uchiha Clan's folly. You were just a child. Also, do you think
I did it just for you? I wanted to be judged and
dealt with only by another Uchiha. So I took advantage of
the hatred inside you. That's why I failed. Ultimately, I filled you with hatred
and made you go rogue. And turned you into a criminal! Chidori! All I wanted was for you
to walk the right path. Before I died, I tried to lead you down that one path
without any forks or turns… I changed the signposts on that path with lies
and my Visual Prowess. I was supposed to happily walk
that one path, ignorant of everything?! I…don't care for such a path! Yeah… You're absolutely right. You must decide your own journey. No matter how much you try
to rewrite the signposts, my eyes can strip away
the top layer! What's so funny?! Nothing… I'm just realizing that the signposts were
not your only guides. I'm a dead man. There's no point in
talking any further. When you were alive,
you never paid any attention to me. Always flicking my forehead, saying "forgive me"
and running off. Now you're dead, and
you're still running away from me?! I'm not running away. I told you. There's something I must do. I must stop…the Reanimation. You there…woman,
user of the Medical Ninjutsu… You have his blood running
through your veins, don't you? And what of it?! I'll bring you down first. Taking out a unit's Medic Ninja
first is an established tactic. Surely, you don't think we'd
let you do that so easily, do you? You're wrong… It's because she's a descendant
of Hashirama Senju. Your Medical Ninjutsu
is only strong enough to defer death for
only a short while. Compared to Hashirama Senju,
your jutsu is trivial. He was able to heal without
even weaving signs. He was in another class
in every jutsu. Everyone called him
the most powerful shinobi. I fought a real death match
against him… This is child's play. Compared to him, what do you,
his descendant, have to offer? You can't even use the Wood Style… Your Medical Ninjutsu
doesn't even come close. And most of all,
you're a weak woman! Weakness disgusts me. And a weak Senju disgusts me
even more! You've gone on long enough! I am a descendant of
the first Hokage Hashirama… And true,
I don't use the Wood Style. My Medical Ninjutsu is pathetic
compared to the First's, who didn't even
have to weave signs! And I am a woman… A woman, yes…
But not a weak woman. Simple strength isn't everything. It's something passed on to me, and continues to flow
from the First Hokage. That is my true power! So don't you dare underestimate
the Will of Fire! This Reanimation Jutsu will not
come undone even if you kill me. But I am the only one
who can stop it. In other words, you can't kill me. I'll make you stop the Reanimation. This jutsu has neither risks
nor weaknesses. Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 You think you can beat me
with Hashirama's will? Power is not will. Power is only the ability
to make things happen. You're wrong! The will of the dead
shows its power in those they left behind! I used that will to develop
my Medical Ninjutsu. From there, Medic Ninja and
Medical Laws were established! Rule One! A Medic Ninja must
never give up on treatment until their patient's dying breath. Rule Two! A Medic Ninja must
never go to the frontlines! Rule Three! A Medic Ninja should always be the last of their platoon to die! This is what I teach my students. But there is actually
one more rule… Rule Four! A Medic Ninja who masters the Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration,
the 100 Healings… may break the first three rules! The 100 Healings Jutsu? I've never heard of it. It's a Forbidden Jutsu that
applies only to me. Which means, I am the only Medic Ninja
allowed to battle! The Particle Style Jutsu may
have dissipated the pollen… But adding one Medic Ninja
won't make any difference… Four wasn't working,
so we'll try five! Don't you dare think
I'm an ordinary Medic Ninja! She's not as fast as the Raikage… Let's go! But her power is greater than his! Fire Style… Majestic Demolisher Flame! Water Style: Water Pillar! Water Style!
Water Dragon Missile! Weighted Boulder! Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop! I admit…
You're not weak, woman. However… If you step in and die here, all the other Kage will die. Since you're the only one
who can heal them. That's if I die. Hashirama… I don't know what
you left behind… But this falls far short
of your abilities. If you were going to let
your underlings take over, you should have taught them
how to resurrect you too… All that's left of you is
the life force of your cells that cling to me. All that's left of
my little brother is the Visual Prowess of his eyes,
which are now mine. That's why… I said you're wrong! The only thing that is
passed down… is hatred. What?! Madara was brought back
with the Reanimation? Now that the real Madara
showed up, the Five Kage had to step in! As the Hokage, Lady Tsunade
has joined the battle as well. Tsunade is the Hokage?! She became the Hokage?! Did I neglect to tell you? Well, Lady Tsunade went through
quite a lot after your passing… But in the end, it just showed
how much she cared about you. Tsunade… There's no way Lady Tsunade
will lose! That's why she is
the sole surviving member of the Legendary Sannin! You're already dead! So don't spread any more hate! Kazekage! Now! Grand Sand Mausoleum! He's been sealed! All right! The one you sealed away
is a Wood Style Clone that Hashirama used to use. It is well made… My Visual Prowess made me the only shinobi
who was able to see the ruse… in the past. Now then… It's over for the rest of you Kage… Don't underestimate Madara! The only way to stop Madara
is to stop the one who cast
the Reanimation. Is Madara…
that powerful a shinobi? Even against the Five Kage
facing him now? Aside from the late First Hokage… there is no one right now
who can defeat Madara in battle… My guard and my barrier sustainer
should stay here. Everyone else should be going after
the caster of the Reanimation Jutsu! How is HQ dealing with this? Every effort is being made, but there's been no concrete intel… Don't die…Tsunade! Summoning Jutsu! Damn it! You stay here. There, huh? What a useless barrier. I'm impressed you were able
to pass through my barrier, and find this place. When you were controlling me, I was able to pinpoint where
your chakra was coming from. That's another risk of this jutsu. Though you won't need to
remember that for next time. Thanks for the tip. I didn't expect any shinobi
to counter this jutsu, so I didn't even worry about it. By the way, there's something
I'd like you to know as well. This Reanimation Jutsu
will not come undone even if you kill me. But I am the only one
who can stop it. In other words… You can't kill me. If I die, you'll never be able
to stop this jutsu. I guess my luck
hasn't run out yet! Things are not always as
we wish them to be, damn it! I caught up to you! What the hell are you doing here? Is that…Orochimaru? You're a little off… That voice… Kabuto! It's perfect timing that my compensation
for participating in this war would show up, on his own,
at this particular moment… I am so lucky. What are you talking about? What are you both doing here? It's rather complicated… Let me try to explain. Go ahead. And in the meantime,
I'll stop the Reanimation. This jutsu has neither
risks nor weaknesses. I want you to understand
that Itachi. Even if you do make a move, I doubt Sasuke will just
sit back and watch. If you rush, you may not succeed, even if it were possible,
conversely… Kabuto, answer my question! I guess I have to tell you,
after all. I mean, while you were asleep from having your brother's eyes
transplanted into you… something drastic happened
in our world. Tobi started the war, huh? So you know a little. Yes, that's true… The Fourth Great Ninja War… Tobi and I are at war
with the coalition of the Nations of Fire, Wind,
Water, Earth and Lightning… The Allied Shinobi Force. There's no way you two can fight against the Five Great Nations! Oh, but we can… With a hundred thousand
mass-produced White Zetsu! And the reanimated battalion
that I created… Kinkaku and Ginkaku! The former members of the Seven Ninja Swords
Men of the Mist! The Second Tsuchikage… The Third Raikage… The Second Mizukage… The Fourth Kazekage… And Madara Uchiha… I don't have time to mention
all the names. Your brother over there is
also one of the ones I reanimated. Well? Not too shabby, huh? Although Madara Uchiha
planned everything. What do you mean? Like you two,
he hated the Shinobi World. And so, he came up
with Project Tsuki no Me. Project Tsuki no Me? A plan to cast a powerful genjutsu
over the entire world using the Ten Tails. To control the world. For that,
we need Naruto's Nine Tails and Killer Bee's Eight Tails. And just about now… Madara is causing a ruckus
on the battlefield in order to get them. Now then, who's next…? How can you move? Like I told you, I'm different! Regeneration without weaving signs… So that's the real power of your jutsu
mentioned in Rule Four. It's just like Hashirama's power. I wanted to catch you off guard
with this, but… You can't kill me with
my own jutsu. I can kill you, with my jutsu! All right! Have you gone senile, Ohnoki? The Rinnegan can absorb
all jutsu. Ninjutsu like that will
not work against me! To kill me, you need to hit me
hard physically and seal me. You know that. My Particle Style grazed
your chest earlier… There's no way that the Atomic
Dismantling Jutsu didn't work! Oh that… I just wanted to show you
all Hashirama's face. I wanted to reduce your morale… But it seems it had the opposite effect…
It boosted your morale instead. Let me ask you a question. While it doesn't change the fact that you outwitted us with
the Wood Style Clone… But from another angle, you could say we managed
to corner you into having to substitute
a clone for yourself. Am I wrong? It is five against one, after all… Even if it is five-to-one,
we must win, no matter what. Don't call it unfair! In truth, it is a testament
to your might! You are Madara Uchiha! It's not unfair. Five-to-one… It's just the right ratio
for playing games. Now it's five-to-one. Don't say this is unfair. You are the Five Kage. So now I've got
a question for you… Would you like these clones
to use Susano'o or not? Your choice. So that's the story of the war… But what is a Reanimation
like you doing here? Your intent to kill is real. The reason is simple… I'm not under his control. You're absolutely right. I must hand it to you,
Itachi Uchiha. Imagine, overwriting
the Reanimation Jutsu with your genjutsu… Normally, one wouldn't
even think of that. Sorry, but I hate taking orders. Well, I agree with you there. You haven't answered
all my questions! Just because you asked
doesn't mean you're going to get a reply. You haven't changed
from the days when you were the popular one
at the Academy. Meaning…I'm still forceful? Just kidding! Looks like your big brother here… I came to kill you. You heard him. Reanimation… You got a hold
of a silly Forbidden Jutsu. But you see,
thanks to this jutsu, you siblings get to have
a touching reunion. I was hoping for
a little gratitude here. Reanimation can't control
the heart. You've desecrated souls
that were purified and continue to spread
unnecessary sadness and hate. Can you understand the pain felt by the dead who
are forced to fight? The pain of the living
is even greater. After finally getting over
the grief and sadness… your jutsu has stirred
those feelings again! Well... I'm a little surprised… that someone who slaughtered
the entire Uchiha Clan has such a tender heart… Does it mean you regret it? If so, I'm not interested. Say whatever you want. You die here. Sasuke… You want to bring down Itachi, the bane of the Uchiha,
once again, don't you? Since I brought him back
to this realm. In short, Itachi is a nuisance
to both you and myself. Well? Shall we team up and
take down Itachi together? We share the same power of
the snake and the same Master— I have no intention of calling
that thing my Master! Besides, it seems like
you don't know anything, do you? I chased Itachi all the way here
to talk to him. Well then…whose side
are you on right now? Why?! He's just like Orochimaru! Which means he's my enemy! And right now,
he's your enemy too, right?! All right, we'll talk later. First things first,
let's take him down. But don't kill him. If you kill the caster
of the Reanimation, the jutsu can never
be undone. We'll put him under
my Tsukuyomi, then we'll make him tell us
how to stop this jutsu. And while he's still under
the Tsukuyomi, I'll control him and…
I'll break this jutsu. Thanks for the play-by-play. I hope it goes as smoothly
as you say. But I told you earlier, this jutsu has neither weakness
nor risks— Every jutsu has a weakness. This jutsu's weakness and risk… is my existence! Itachi…you've kept lying to me, telling me "next time"
or "later," then you died on me… So this time for sure… I'm holding you to
your promise. They say you take
your personality to the grave. Well, I've already died once. I intend to honor it. The estranged brothers
come together to gang up on me? How fun! Those snakes are sensing
exactly where we are.

 Snakes perceive body heat
and smell with their tongues.

 You've studied a lot!
You're like a snake expert now.

 Of course I did.
In order to take down Orochimaru!

 I'm no longer a snake…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Sibling Tag Team"

 I am now a dragon!
 
 SIBLING TAG TEAM
 


 Tune in again!

 They say you take your personality
to the grave… Well, I've already died once. I intend to honor it. The estranged brothers come
together to gang up on me? How fun! Sibling Tag Team Bookish types like me
aren't used to being stared at. Countermeasures for genjutsu, huh? Judging from their movements, those snakes can sense
exactly what we're doing. Snakes perceive their surroundings
through body heat and smell through their tongues. You've studied a lot! You're like a snake expert now. Of course I did. In order
to take down Orochimaru! However… You can't beat me by just
being a snake expert. This is my field.
Nature is on my side. The snakes have gotten bigger! Does this terrain give him
an advantage? Be wary of traps, Sasuke. Traps? Oh, that's not what I meant! That's the Susano'o, right? Don't get too violent, Sasuke! Remember, I told you
not to kill him! It seems he's acquired
Orochimaru's power. He won't die so easily! Sasuke! The hood! What?! Why that—! You're taking
the shyness thing too far. First, you hide your face,
and now your entire body? Did you just molt
to make a getaway? All you have is what
you took from Orochimaru. You're still nothing! Sasuke… You underestimate me. Well, then again,
I was listed lower than you on the danger scale
in the Bingo Book… And of course, I'm nothing
compared to Lord Orochimaru. That's for sure. Especially if you consider
this hiding. Sasuke, watch out! There's chakra everywhere… It's hard to tell which
is the real one. It's the ability to transform
one's flesh into liquid. To detach and separate
using one's own life substance. That's why it looks like a shedding. I've researched and applied the Hozuki Clan's Flesh Transforming
ability to this technique. You know him, don't you? Suigetsu. He can transform from human
to water, and back to human again. Plus, I have the amazing ability
to recuperate quickly. I admit it's a healing technique
that I studied from the body of a woman
originally from the Uzumaki Clan… Someone you're quite familiar
with… Karin. Karin's from the Uzumaki Clan? A special trait of those with
Uzumaki blood is their red hair. And their life force is
as tenacious as a cockroach's. Now then, you must be thinking about the last member
of your team. Or perhaps he's no longer
your comrade? You have a discerning eye
since you chose those three. In the Shinobi World,
those without talent are nothing. But those who lack talent
can just steal it from those who do. Seems like you have
Jugo's ability too… Did you receive a Curse Mark
from Orochimaru?! No! That is just a temporary boost. That memento is something
I actually cultivated myself… at Ryuchi Cave! Ryuchi Cave?! Impossible! Yes, I found it! A place as legendary as Mt. Myoboku,
and the Shikkotsu Woods! Lord Orochimaru is not
the only one to have reached it. I went there… RYUCHI CAVE and trained under the guidance
of the White Snake Sage. And I was able to surpass
Lord Orochimaru at long last. I did it! Don't be impatient, Sasuke! He dodged…that arrow? My sensory ability is better
than it used to be. Nature Energy is my ally now. Nature Energy? I knew it. So he does have… Listen… The members of Jugo's clan
have always had special bodies that
absorbed Nature Energy. That's the secret behind
those rampages. The ability causes them to suddenly
become more wild and powerful. Lord Orochimaru wasn't interested
in Jugo's rampages… so much as the origin
of his clan's power. And he finally found the source… It was Ryuchi Cave. Lord Orochimaru immediately
tried to acquire that power. But, he didn't yet possess a body
that could tolerate it. That's why… He couldn't become the perfect Sage… that I have become! I see… As expected…
you're using Sage Mode power. You're just like Orochimaru! A disgusting snake! You ought to know better,
you snake expert… I'm no longer a snake. With my perfect Sage power,
I've shed my snakeskin… I am now a dragon! Answer me. Would you like these clones
to use Susano'o or not? Your choice. The likes of you have no answer. Well, I'll answer for you. Impossible… Damn him! They will use it. Damn them. Each one of us must take on five. Five to one… No, it's 25 to five. Lord Tsuchikage? We'll guard each other's backs
and coordinate attacks. We are the Five Kage! – Yes!
– That's right! Let's go! The Five Kage are struggling
against Madara. There's unbelievable chakra! He's not just a legendary shinobi…
He's been reanimated. He's immortal,
so he has infinite chakra. It's no wonder the Five Kage
are having a hard time. We must do something about
the user of this Reanimation Jutsu. Any word from the Investigative Unit? Nothing. They've been searching
every spot thought to be a hideout. And not one sign of Kabuto. And the Sensory Unit? We're getting no response. He's probably put up a barrier. Shall I send out more shinobi? We've sent every man available. Anymore will weaken the front. Who would have imagined that
Kabuto could do so much? Sage Art: White Extreme Attack! My ears… And my bones… They feel like
they're being grated. It's a jutsu that uses
light and sound to impair vision and hearing… A jutsu that causes
the air to oscillate… to paralyze the senses,
freezing movement. A snake's cornea can
block out the light and by turning my flesh
into fluid, I can easily absorb
the sound and vibration. The only one who can move
freely under these conditions… is me in Sage Mode! It's no use! We can't maintain Susano'o! Yes, I should go for Itachi. I'll rewrite the Paper Seal
in his head and turn him into
my pawn again. Or even better… Itachi… It seems you always
end up finding me. Can you sense my chakra? But…wait a minute… I'm impressed you were able
to pass through my barrier, and find this place. When you were controlling me, I was able to pinpoint where
your chakra was coming from. That's another risk
of this jutsu. I remember you said,
"when I was controlling you…" So you can't sense
my chakra now, can you? You're trying to trick me
with your lies again? I never said I was the one who was able to sense
your chakra. Only Nagato could do that,
and I was with him. I have no such ability. Besides, even now, I know
what your target is anyway. I merely move to protect that which
I think you'll most want to attack. If a man as cautious and
opportunistic as you wants Sasuke… you will go for him first. Your best chance to
capture Sasuke is now, before either of us figures
out your jutsu. And after that, you could use
Sasuke to manipulate me. What sets you apart from
the rest of the Uchiha Clan is that you have true Visual Prowess… You have the ability to peer into
and read people's souls. And use what you learn in battle. That is why you are so good
at deceiving people… You died lying in the first place, that makes you a dirty lying ninja
through and through! He's on the ceiling! You think a makeshift team of two can outwit my perception skills? And because your brother
lied so much, you know nothing about each other… Sasuke… Do you remember that time you tagged along with me
on my mission? The wild boar? I'm off. You…?! Oh that, I remember. Wild boar…? I'm off. You…?! I heard you're going on
a wild boar hunt, Big Brother! I heard it's big like a monster. And it's bad, because
it's tearing up the fields. Isn't that why you're going
on the mission, to take it down? And you're going alone, right? But it's okay,
since I'm coming with you. You know, right? That I'm a good archer? I've gone hunting
with you often. Sorry, Sasuke. Next time. What?! Big Brother! Big Brother! I'm surprised that you caught up. Well, I've been training… Climb up here. Okay! That's it, right? Don't kill it. Huh? Just hurt it, and it will return
to the mountain. Let's go. Yeah. Don't hit a vital spot. I know! – Now!
– Now! He's going to steal my blade and cut off his own tail
to escape! That's why he told you
not to be so impatient. Oh that's right, I'd forgotten. I have horns here now. Big Brother… You completely missed. Sorry, Big Brother… You need more training. Let's go home, Sasuke. I'll help you train
when we return. Okay! Looks like you might be able to take down that
giant wild boar now. Instead of that giant wild boar, we've got to take down
that snake. Yeah… I sympathize greatly with Itachi.
 Both Itachi and I worked for
the good of the Leaf Village,
 but in return, all we got back
was dishonor and disgrace!
 What in the world has
the Leaf Village ever done for us?
 No matter what darkness
or contradictions lay
 within the village, I am…
 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"To Each Their Own Leaf" I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf! TO EACH THEIR OWN LEAF Tune in again! It's so funny… What is? Right now, you two look like you're quite friendly
with each other. What happened to those brothers
who fought and hated each other? No matter how much you use
those eyes of yours… I'll use my hatred… to turn fantasy into reality! It's not hard to guess that something
happened between you two, back when you took him down… But what is it that you want to ask
of a once-dead man? The truth. Oh really? Could it be?
With the way you're talking… you don't really trust
Itachi, after all? Sasuke… Maybe you already know
the truth about Itachi? No wonder you didn't return
to the Leaf after defeating Itachi. That's why you joined the Akatsuki
who plotted the Leaf's destruction! I see now… It all makes so much sense
to me now. That's why you intend to
destroy the village that caused your brother
so much pain. As expected.
You're not denying it. So you followed your brother,
who you happened across, all the way here to find out
the truth once and for all. Like "Is this what happened then?"
and "What about that time?" in complete detail… Like I said,
your brother is a liar! I know. So isn't it odd? Itachi was willing to kill
his own family to protect the village. Isn't that the opposite of
what you're trying to do? Well… I'm the one who wants
what you want, Sasuke! After all, Lord Orochimaru could not
complete Leaf Destruction. And it is I who inherited that task. So think carefully… Now's the time to stab Itachi
in the back and join me. What? You don't have to feel guilty. He's already dead.
He's just an imitation. It was a mission. To be the sole perpetrator of
his clan's slaughter and become a Rogue Ninja with
his reputation in tatters. All of that was his mission. And Itachi completely
fulfilled his duty… With one exception… He could not bring himself…
to kill his younger brother. To Each Their Own Leaf


 We received intel that
Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki is dead. Put a mark on his image and
remove him from your Bingo Book. So that traitor is dead at last. But Captain,
who was able to kill him? Looks like it was
his kid brother, Sasuke. How ironic… His own brother killed the one
who slaughtered his family. Serves him right!
After the atrocious thing he did! Not only that, he joined up
with the Akatsuki and came after the Leaf Village! He's the most notorious villain
in Hidden Leaf history! Damn it, I wish we got
our hands on him first! Since he took down such
a special S-Class criminal, his little brother will probably
receive many decorations and a large bounty from
the nation and village, right? I wonder how much? It's not a question of money.
You're out of line. Well… I know, but… They don't know the truth… Besides, there are
too many people around. I'll teach them the truth! Don't… Even if they try to confirm the truth
about Itachi with their superiors, the Leaf's elders will
deny it vehemently. Even the current Hokage
doesn't know the facts. Furthermore… Itachi did slaughter the Uchiha,
and he joined the Akatsuki on the pretense of attacking
the Hidden Leaf. No one will believe the truth… Look how long it took you. For bastards like them… For these bastards
who easily brand him a traitor… my brother… This is exactly what
Itachi wanted. If you don't like it,
what is it that you want? We're not the same. My Leaf Destruction is mine alone! I understand very well
why Itachi chose that life. I was just like him… It was nice being found
by a Leaf Shinobi, but because my background
was a mystery, I was raised to be a spy. In order to become someone
who could be trusted, Medical Ninjutsu was
drilled into me. I went from village to
village spying… I pretended to be someone else,
living a life of lies. With no place for the real me. I had no friends
who knew the real me. I continued to work
on suppressing myself. And around the time I stopped knowing
who I even was anymore… the Hidden Leaf Village
stopped trusting me and I was relieved of my mission. Both Itachi and I worked for
the good of the Leaf Village, but in return, all we got
was dishonor and disgrace! What in the world has
the Leaf Village ever done for us? How Itachi lived is what led to
the creation of the current you. And though I am still alive, something similar to you
was born from me too. No one understands you
better than I. Thus, I will be your big brother
and stick by your side. Now…join me… Don't listen to him, Sasuke. He was an even better spy
than I was. Which means, he's even better
than me at lying. And… No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within the village, I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf! Sasuke… It's my fault
you're like this right now. I know I have no right
to advise you in any way. But I hope you'll hear me out because I have to
tell you something. But first, let's take care
of business… and stop this guy. You cannot kill me as long as I am the user
of the Reanimation Jutsu. And I can instantly recover
from any injury you inflict. It's meaningless. I shut down my eyesight. So the much-touted genjutsu
of your Visual Prowess won't work on me… You brothers can't beat me! Because I cast it, this Reanimation Jutsu
is invincible! It's a pain listening to him. But he explained
the situation perfectly. I don't need you to tell me that. So…what should we do? He doesn't know the true power
of the Uchiha. The Uchiha have a Visual Jutsu
that can be used on an opponent without eyesight… In exchange for losing the light
in one's eyes. Izanagi…? You know about Izanagi? Danzo used it when I fought him. You're lucky to be alive. Never mind about that… How do we use Izanagi? I'm not talking about Izanagi. Another Forbidden Jutsu that
is considered its other half. Another?! I've already laid the plan. An Ultimate Visual Jutsu that
holds his fate within its grasp. Izanami! Izanami?! If Izanagi is a jutsu
that changes one's fate, then Izanami is a jutsu
that decides it! Sasuke… Do not leave my side. A jutsu that decides one's fate? So there's another jutsu
similar to Izanagi?! I don't know what you're up to… but nothing will work against me. It seems you still don't
understand just who I am! Sage Art…
Inorganic Animation! Itachi! This jutsu brings
the lifeless to life and allows me to control them. It's different from a jutsu that
simply manipulates with chakra… A bit extreme, don't you think? Protecting Sasuke with
your Susano'o slowed you down. Well, don't worry.
I would never harm Sasuke. He's my precious test subject. Now then… Time to rewrite your mind with this. You know what will happen, right? Amaterasu! So… The Ultimate Visual Jutsu
offensive attack is also the Ultimate Defense… It's so hot, the limestone cave
went back to being just a cave. I'm sorry…Sasuke… Sorry, but this is my win. I am so near the point where I can achieve and
control everything… I can't imagine myself failing. All the laws and principles
of nature, which Lord Orochimaru researched
and compiled for so long… are now stored and
being used inside of me. I have evolved from human
to snake to dragon. I am the closest thing
in this world to the Sage of Six Paths. Compared to me, the Uchiha are… Shut up! What would you know…
about the Uchiha?! Listen…! Kabuto… When I look at you, it's like looking at my former self. And that is why you will lose… Listen… I'm not on
the sidelines anymore. You could say I'm a central figure
in this war! I had the Akatsuki twisted
around my little finger, and manipulated this war
to my advantage… and I even pushed
the Uchiha brothers into a corner. I hate you,
but I understand you. We were both spies who lived false lives
in this world. I didn't know who I really was
at one point either. I finally understand that
to know oneself is not to achieve everything
and become perfect. It's knowing what you can
and cannot do. Sounds like the words of a loser. Acknowledging what
you cannot do… Isn't that the same as giving up? No. It is to be able to forgive oneself for the things one cannot
do by themselves. You can't do everything yourself. That's why you have comrades
who can help you. And it also makes sure that you don't miss the things
that you can still accomplish. If you want to know
who you are… You must reexamine and
acknowledge your true self. I failed to do that. I lied to everyone and I lied to myself…
and I deluded myself. Those who cannot acknowledge
themselves will fail… Just like I did. And what would you two
really know about me? I have been pursuing who
and what I am in my own way. My whole life… I bet he's from that city… Where that recent battle was! What'll we do, Sis? He's bleeding from the head. He's gonna die soon. Are you gonna take him? Urushi… His injuries are less severe
than yours were. Don't worry. I may not look it,
but I know some Medical Ninjutsu. Where are your parents? What's your name? Man… Don't you understand anything?! Urushi, lend him your shoulder. You're lucky, kid! Come on, grab my shoulder! That's my first memory… I was a nobody and had nothing from
the very beginning. I didn't know my parents… I didn't even know my name. Your wound seems
to be healing nicely. Hey, at least say, "thank you"! Don't you have any manners?! Hey, we don't want anything
to happen to you again, so put this on! Ow… You don't have manners,
you don't have parents… you don't even know your name.
That's a first for me! You'll be living here
with us now. In other words, I am your mother,
starting now. You can always ask me
for whatever you need. It's inconvenient that
he doesn't have a name… You're right… What would be a good name? How about…
"Kabuto" like the helmet? – Sounds simple.
– That was quick. You called it by just how he looks. It's best not to overthink things. – I'll think of something.
– Not you! What would be a good name? Hey, he smiled! I think he likes that name! Oh good… At least say, "thank you"!
Don't you have any manners?! Hmm… What to do…? We can't get by with
just subsistence aid from the village or nation anymore. We have to talk to them once more! Neither the village nor
the nation will give us a cent more. But we're barely scraping by. And we just took another one in… I understand.
I'll do something about it, so… Oww! What are you doing at this hour?! You should be in bed! He just got here and doesn't know about
our curfews and rules! Please give him another chance! You're too indulgent, Mother. Come here and
look at the clock! It's already 20 minutes
past lights-out time! Which makes lights-out
what time? Let's learn it right now! Well, what time is it?
You must learn it yourself! He's still young. He doesn't know arithmetic
or how to tell time. Let's just call it a night. Nine o'clock. That's correct. It seems it was just bad vision! He's smart for his age! We must get him glasses! Huh? And where are we going
to get money for that? Goodness! If you can't see,
you should just speak up. From now,
you'll be able to be on time. I just hope the lenses
are right for you. Thank…you… My name is symbolic. My eyeglasses, a tool… Thank you… From the very beginning, – I was a nobody…
– Thank you… Thank you… Thank you… That's enough. From the very beginning… I had… nothing. Mother…didn't know me. Why?

 Why didn't she know me?

 If she doesn't know me,
then who am I?

 What were all those things
I received from Mother?

 My name, that I was one
of Mother's children,

 even these glasses…

 Who am I?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kabuto Yakushi"

 It seems you no longer
see yourself clearly… KABUTO YAKUSHI Tune in again!

 Kabuto Yakushi If you want to know who you are… You must re-examine and
acknowledge your true self. Those who cannot acknowledge
themselves will fail… Just like I did. I was nobody… and had nothing
from the very beginning. Kabuto, are you able
to keep going? Yes, Mother! I know it's for the sake
of the orphanage, but why do we have
to help shinobi like them? Doing nothing doesn't
bring in money… Urushi, could you get more bandages? Yeah, sure! You're not a shinobi, but you're quite skilled
at Medical Ninjutsu… Mother taught me. You said your name was Kabuto? Why don't you become a shinobi? You'd make a good one… I'm sure of it. I'm not interested in that. I just want to help raise money
for the orphanage and help Mother there. She's done so much for me… but I've only been able to repay her
with a pair of eyeglasses… Really? What a shame. You were known
as the Wandering Nun, and now you're just a babysitter. It's been a while
since I last saw you, but you're looking a little tired, Nonou. I cast aside that name long ago. Talks with the Leaf for
monetary aid were concluded. So why are you here now? It seems the Espionage Unit's
former top spy stopped knowing things after
she left the Foundation. We did not come here only
in regard to the aid money. In this time of war, we have obtained intel that
the Hidden Stone are plotting some sort of large-scale operation. We want you to infiltrate
the Hidden Stone and verify the validity of this intel. And if it does turn out to be true, you are to investigate what
this operation entails and where it will occur
and report back to us. This will likely be
a long-term mission. Then you've come
to the wrong person. I'm no longer… You people don't understand
just how essential Mother is to this orphanage and
to the children! She has done her utmost
to protect this orphanage. Such a dangerous task! You Foundation people ought
to do it yourselves. Why must you come
and bother her? The Wandering Nun is the only one we can entrust
this long-term mission to. Currently, no one in the Foundation
has her espionage skills. Most would likely break or
end up switching allegiances. I know that she's a Kunoichi who would never sell out
the Hidden Leaf… From that expression, I can tell you've already
guessed it, Nonou. Yes, if you refuse,
this clinic will stop receiving funding. That's not fair! This was already settled
with the Third Hokage! You cannot do this! This orphanage looks easy
to break into and rob… You should hire bodyguards
to prevent robbers from stealing your money. That is, if you can afford any. While you're at it, take care that your children
don't get snatched either. Children with no past or family
are worth something. You're all rotten! How dare you call
yourselves shinobi?! You're the ones
who don't understand! It's a small price to pay
to protect the Hidden Leaf! I understand. Wait, Mother…! It's come to this because
you couldn't kill your emotions. You weren't suited for
the Foundation, after all. How dare you…! Also, I've already lost a subordinate
obtaining this intel… I'll be taking one of the children here
to take his place. How far will you go? I said I'd accept the mission! This is a separate matter. Your mission shall cover
subsequent payments. But this current one is
in exchange for the child. Some children actually wish to
become a Leaf Shinobi, after all. You should ask them
to choose for themselves. There may just be one such child. Why, Kabuto? I think I'm suited to be a ninja. Besides, I want to hone
my Medical Ninjutsu. Kabuto! You're just going to throw away
the three years you spent with us?! Come back here! Have you forgotten
the house rules, everyone? It's way past lights-out. It's no use. I'm surrounded. If I hadn't messed up,
I'd be in bed by now. It's been five years since
I left the orphanage. I wish I could've seen Mother and
everyone else one last time… Mother! No! Why are you here? We want you to infiltrate
the Hidden Stone… The Wandering Nun is the only one we can entrust this
long-term mission to. Don't tell me…you were still
on that last mission?! Why are you healing my wounds? Who are you…? It's me, Mother! It's Kabuto!
Don't worry, I'll save you. Who…are you…? This way! Damn it! Nanigashi's been killed! Mother didn't know me? Why? Why didn't she remember me?
Why? If she doesn't remember me,
then who was I all this time? What were all those things
I received from Mother? My name, that I was
one of Mother's children, even these glasses… Who… are you? This isn't me… This isn't the real me… It seems you no longer
see yourself clearly. You've become a fine shinobi. I remember you…Kabuto. A-Aren't you…?! I've been watching you
this whole time. Along with Nonou. Come with me. Then I'll tell you everything
you want to know. What I want to know?
What does that mean? Why Mother targeted you… and why she didn't
remember you at all. Don't you want to know…all that? This is my hideout.
No one knows about it. Which means you are
my very first visitor. Why did you bring me here?! What are you going to do with me? You are becoming
more and more curious. That's a good thing. People can never escape
their curiosity. Which is why you followed me here. Then tell me quickly! You know what I want to know,
don't you? To be frank, the Foundation
had decided to dispose of both you and Mother. What do you mean?! You both were too brilliant
as spies. You ended up knowing too much. What?! We risked our lives for so long, gathering intel for
the sake of the village… And this is what we get? At times, intel becomes
even more powerful than the mightiest jutsu or weapon. You are seen as a very dangerous
person right now. Well, your fate had been decided
from the very beginning… It was in the scenario for you to kill each other in
a mutual strike. Right after you left the orphanage, Danzo revealed to Mother
the real reason why you had left. That you sacrificed yourself and joined the Foundation
for money for the orphanage. Mother wished to liberate you
from the Foundation. As a condition of accepting her wish,
Danzo ordered the assassination of a certain person
several years ago. Ironically… The target of the assassination…
was you. I thought it was the condition
for my release! Why didn't Mother realize
it was me?! I told you… The Foundation intended
for the two of you to take each other out. And there was other trickery afoot. Trickery? You and Mother were sent into
separate enemy territories so that you two would never meet, and Mother was kept informed
of your well-being and progress through photos. The photos of you
were skillfully replaced with those of another
without her noticing it. Over time, Mother was made
to think someone else was you. Gradual brainwashing. A common practice used
by the Foundation. That's the other Kabuto. And so, Nonou tried to kill you, never in her wildest dreams
imagining that you were Kabuto… She thought you were a double agent
who betrayed the village. And the Foundation dispatched you
to deal with whoever was left… Is that it? For someone who knows
nothing about himself… You're very perceptive. I always wanted…
an explanation about who I was! And I thought
I had finally found it! But thanks to you
Foundation bastards, I've lost myself again! These glasses were
what linked me to Mother! The name she gave me
was mine and mine alone! Mother was supposed
to be the parent that didn't forget me,
no matter what! But everything's wrong! Then who in the world… am I?! You merely lack sufficient intel
with which to define yourself. It's just that neither the glasses,
your name, nor the fact that you're her child were things that denote
who you really are. And that's fine. If you're not satisfied with
what you've had so far… Just find other things and
add them onto yourself, one by one. If you plan on killing me… why are you telling me all this? I also want to know who or what I am. And I've been collecting
all sorts of things. I repeatedly experiment on
and inspect these many things I've collected a little at a time… and store the gained knowledge
and abilities within myself. And then, I undergo rebirth, ever evolving toward
a more perfect me. Afterward, I again obtain
even newer items. This time… it's you. There's no way you couldn't derive
who you are and what you are by gathering all the intel and
things that exist in this world. Why am I one of those things
to you? Because I recognize your talent more than anyone else
in this world. It would be a waste to kill you. Besides, this medical research facility
was prepared just for you. What are you plotting? Instead of the Foundation
which erases individuality… I will create an organization
that guides individuality. I will create a village. The Village of the Hidden Sound…
that does not belong to any nation. From this moment, you and I will desert
the Hidden Leaf's Foundation. From this moment, I shall be your superior,
your brother, and your parent. I will protect you from Danzo. From this moment, this will be your
new personal history: When you were very young,
you were found and raised by a Medical Corps Captain
following the Battle at Kikyo Pass. After returning to work under Danzo, Nonou Yakushi kept her cover
as a captain of the Medical Unit… and you shall be reborn today
as her son, Kabuto Yakushi. I am Orochimaru. If you want to know
who and what you are… Come…be by my side. There's another organization
I want to look into… Please leave it to me. What is this organization? The Akatsuki. Bring me Orochimaru's human
experimentation data and any intel on
the Reanimation Jutsu. Understood, Lord Sasori. You are useful. You can erase your sound,
your scent, even yourself. You're just like one of my puppets. If you're not satisfied with
what you've had so far… Just find other things… and add them onto yourself,
one by one. It's still…not enough… This is…still not me…! Are you sure we can't kill him?

 We're stuck playing catch-up!

 I told you no!

 He controls the battlefield
right now. Be patient.

 Is the Izanami still not ready?

 He's about to come after us!

 I'm already on him.

 It's just going to take
a little more time.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Izanami Activated"


 I've shut off my vision,
so genjutsu won't work on me!


 THE IZANAMI ACTIVATED


 Tune in again!

 I had nothing… This is still not enough… This is still not me! That's why…
I've kept adding onto myself. That's why I don't need
your lectures. I need your abilities and intel. Not only are you
a Leaf Shinobi, you're of the famed
Uchiha bloodline. You possess the Sharingan that
has awakened the Mangekyo… You bore many secrets
and stopped a war… You had many jutsu
and much power. Itachi, you possessed many things
that made you who you are. There is no finer Reanimation
out there of mine than you. And my pawns are
part of my power! You exaggerate… The reality is, I failed. No, even though I mocked
the Uchiha name in front of you earlier, I'm still quite envious
of that name. The Uchiha name merely
identifies one's bloodline and clan membership. So it's meaningless for you
to claim it. I was nobody. I had nothing. I bet he's from that city… where that recent battle was! Where are your parents? Don't worry. I may not look it, but I know
some Medical Ninjutsu. How about…Kabuto? Sounds simple. That was quick. You called it by just how he looks. It's best not to overthink things. Until I was given a name… and a place to call home… Claiming a name is meaningless? No… It does hold meaning. Are you sure we can't kill him? We're stuck playing catch-up! I told you no! He controls the battlefield right now. Be patient. Is the Izanami still not ready? He's about to come after us! I'm already on him. It's just going to take
a little more time. Lord Orochimaru said thusly… Sakon! Demon Twin Jutsu! Jirobo! Earth Style:
Terra Shield! "If you want to know who
and what you are, "all you need to do is gather
every single thing "and piece of information
that exists in this world!" Kidomaru! Spiral Web! These threads can't be cut
with a blade! – Amaterasu!
– Amaterasu! Kimimaro! Macabre Bone Pulse!
Bracken Dance! He's laid down the spider silk
all the way to the back. I'll get the one behind us!
Take the front, Brother! Can you still use the Susano'o? Yeah. Inferno Style! Flame Control! Running away to the back? Well, it's no use! Tayuya! Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia! Are you okay, Sasu—?! A genjutsu, huh? Even your specialty, Susano'o,
cannot stifle sound… I knew it… Now you're immobilized. All that's left is… to take you into me
using Lord Orochimaru! The Izanami Activated Well, Sasuke… Do you recognize
this current form of mine? That's…! Thanks to you, I was finally
able to take Lord Orochimaru into my body
after you killed him! Yes, this is my true form… Remember, I said that all the laws
and principles of Nature, which Lord Orochimaru researched
and compiled for so long… are now stored and
being used inside of me. The only thing that was missing…
was Lord Orochimaru himself! Now, I have him inside me! I can't thank you enough, Sasuke! Kabuto… You are not Orochimaru. It's fine to imitate someone
you respect… But don't remake yourself
into him, to that extent. The majority of people start out
by mimicking someone. Like how Sasuke mimicked you. Wow, Brother! You nailed every target, even the one in the blind spot
behind the rock! All right, my turn! Sasuke! It's time to go. You said that you would teach me
a new shuriken jutsu. I have an important mission tomorrow
that I must prepare for. You're a liar… Sorry, Sasuke. – Maybe some other time.
– Ow! Big Brother, watch this! Hey! Don't be reckless… Keep at it and become great
like your brother. Father… I… I wanted you to say that
you were proud of me. Such behavior is merely a process
to help one mature! Don't use it as a cloak
to deceive yourself, like you've done! You gain nothing when
you attach your self-value to something external that's admirable
and praiseworthy to you. I'll say this one last time. Don't mislead yourself with lies. Those who cannot acknowledge
themselves will invariably fail. Fail? The way I am now? How?! Sasuke… Look into my eyes! I understand! Genjutsu… Sharingan! Tsukuyomi! I shall now engage the Izanami. You have already…failed. Is it over? A genius that had everything
would never understand… I just want to be who
and what I am! I won't let anyone stop me. Sa…suke… Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Water Style: Giant Waterfall! The same moves. As expected…
It makes it easy for me to counter. I already told you that as long as
I have my power of recovery, wounding me is meaningless. Since I shut off my vision,
genjutsu won't work on me. You have no chance of winning. Your fate is already in my hands. Thanks to the Uchiha's other
Forbidden Jutsu. That is… Well then… Shall we put that to the test?! …the Izanami! Sasuke, do not leave my side. Why this is just like déjà vu. I'm bored… Let's end this fight already. Your fate may be in my hands now… but you're the only one
who can truly decide how that fate shapes your destiny. Remember what I've told you. And think hard. I have no idea what
you're talking about. Enough of your word games. I will have everything…
I am the strongest of all! That is fact! He who forgives oneself,
who can acknowledge one's true self… is the most powerful of all! Losers… should be quiet! This is… What's…going on? Why? That horn's already
been cut off! How? I have no sight… I should be invulnerable to genjutsu. But this is clearly a…! What did you do to me?! You're in my Visual Jutsu. Impossible! It's the Izanami! How…? No matter. No one can stop me! There's nothing I can't do! I told you… I hold your fate in my hands. Itachi Uchiha! If this is a genjutsu… Release! Calm down… This is an Uchiha Genjutsu. Moreover, Itachi cast it,
so it won't be easy to undo. But there are many ways
to undo a genjutsu! It's useless. Recall my words to you. Sure! I'll copy the same trick
you two used! Tayuya! Demon Flute:
Chains of Fantasia! This will switch from Itachi's control
over genjutsu to Tayuya's control. Then, I'll do this! Sage Art… Inorganic Animation! This area is under my control! I'll retreat for now… Damn it! Don't mess with me! He cannot escape
this samsara, this loop. This is the other Forbidden Jutsu…
the companion to Izanagi. The jutsu that decides one's fate… This is the Izanami. Tailed Beast Counting Song! All right, here we go! One, "sleep is better than humans,"

 The Uchiha Clan, and
their history of conflict.

 IZANAGI AND IZANAMI


 Tune in again!

 It makes it easier to cast
my real Visual Genjutsu on him by keeping him trapped in
a small loop like this. So Kabuto's trapped in
your loop now? And that's the Izanami? When did you cast it? The first time Kabuto stabbed me
with that blade. Back then, huh? But how? You mentioned a Visual Jutsu
that is possible without sight. How can Visual Jutsu work
without eyesight? Izanami is a Visual Jutsu that
works with the physical senses of both yourself and your opponents. The physical senses of two people? As you are battling your opponent,
you take a record, like a photograph, of the physical senses that
both you and your opponent are feeling during that instant,
with your Visual Jutsu. We'll call that A. As time progresses, you find "B" is a more
important moment, then you record "C" and
so on with Sharingan. Then you recreate
those exact physical senses. So you're using your powers to
create an exact copy of A. We'll call this A'. FLOW OF TIME
By overlaying
and connecting A to A', FLOW OF TIME
the Izanami also links
a path for B' and C' FLOW OF TIME
to create fluctuations within
a fixed time. In other words, it's the power
to create an infinite loop. Naturally, all in exchange for
one's own sight of course, exactly like Izanagi. So Kabuto's consciousness
is trapped inside fighting a phantom you and
a phantom me for all eternity. No. There is an escape route built
into the jutsu. The Izanami was developed
to admonish and save an Izanagi user. What does that mean? You know a little about
the Izanagi already. It's called the perfect
Uchiha Visual Jutsu designed to change destiny. If something does not go
the way you want it to, you can just erase that outcome
and start all over. Ultimately, you can pick
and choose the most desirable end result. What I'm about to tell you now
is the story of the Uchiha's Izanami,
and how it came to be. I want you to know this too. The Uchiha's Izanami…
the story of its creation? Izanagi and Izanami


 Long ago, there was
a great battle that the Uchiha Clan could not
afford to lose. The Izanagi tuned out
to be invaluable. Go! Damn it! They had set a trap! What?! Die! As long as we have the Izanagi,
we can't lose! However… There's a bigger risk than
just blindness to a jutsu that allows the casters
to choose their own ending. Most who used this overly
powerful Visual Jutsu could not handle it and
abused their power. It was fine, as long as there was
only one user of the Izanagi. However, when two or more used it, there was a scramble
within the Uchiha Clan to see who could get the best result. You are not the only one
who can use Izanagi! I don't like you bossing us around! But I'm the one who
accomplished it! In the shinobi world,
results count for everything! Well then…
I shall rewrite that result… with my Izanagi! You're only talk. I shall rule the Uchiha…
no, the entire shinobi world… with my Izanagi! I'll take over your wish… with my Izanagi! What was created in order to stop this inter-clan
rivalry over the Izanagi… is the Izanami. Normal vision-based genjutsu
is powerless against Visual Prowess… If you intend to oppose me too, I have no choice. There has to be a way to
settle this without fighting. My hands are already stained
with blood. As if I'm going to stop! You don't know yourself! You don't know your own true strength! Oh, shut up! It's not too late to
turn back right now! If you have the will,
take my hand! I won't be fooled! If you still refuse to listen,
I'm prepared as well. Sneaking up behind me, nice work! But as long as I have Izanagi,
you cannot beat me! It's over for you! I don't believe this! My right eye… I should have gone blind
with the Izanagi! The Izanagi that you depend on so much
will not protect you. Shut up! N-Not… Not yet! In the first place, reality is a product of chance
that we call fate. We can't predict it. But Izanagi can twist around
an inconvenient reality and lead it to a new fate. REALITY

At a whim, IZANAGI ACTIVATED

the user can change
the original reality into a new one. NEW REALITY
IZANAGI ACTIVATED

the user can change
the original reality into a new one. NEW REALITY
IZANAGI ACTIVATED

To the enemy,
a fallen opponent will revive, ANOTHER REALITY
IZANAGI ACTIVATED

To the enemy,
a fallen opponent will revive, so it's an intolerable jutsu. IZANAMI ACTIVATED

The Izanami is set up to take someone
who is using the Izanagi IZANAMI ACTIVATED

to change the outcome
to benefit oneself, IZANAMI ACTIVATED

and cause them to endlessly
circle around in a loop. I believed that Izanagi was
the ultimate Visual Jutsu. But that means the Izanami is
a far superior Visual Jutsu. Izanami forms a loop around the physical sensation
of Izanagi twisting reality. The Izanami is a jutsu meant
for stopping the Izanagi. There's an escape route built
into the loop. Originally, it was a jutsu
to save Uchiha comrades from arrogance and negligence. It's to stop you from taking
the easy way out with jutsu. Why?! There's no destiny that
Izanagi cannot change! Accept the things you've done, and take hold of the future
that awaits you! There's no way I can be forgiven
for the blood on my hands. Still… Take hold of it! I won't rely on Izanagi anymore. I'll accept reality
and move forward… IZANAMI ACTIVATED

Once one accepts the original outcome
and stops trying to run from it, REALITY

the loop will stop. This jutsu guides you toward
accepting your fate, instead of relying on jutsu
to change it. But a jutsu that has an escape
is too dangerous to use in actual combat. That's why Izanami is
a Forbidden Jutsu. If Kabuto stops trying
to transform himself, he can stop the loop. The strife-filled history
of the Uchiha… The arrogance and recklessness
of those who used Izanagi… and how they clashed and
were stopped by Izanami… I understand now why both Izanagi and Izanami
came to be Forbidden Jutsu. And I see how one must learn
from the past and accept one's fate
and move on. But… But why bother casting this
on Kabuto? If there's a way to escape… He reminds me of the old me. He thinks by acquiring all there is, he can accomplish
whatever he wants. He makes himself
believe that he can't fail, and lies to himself. I stopped listening to anyone else.
I stopped trusting anyone. In Kabuto's case,
he is so deluded that he thinks all these powers
are his and his alone. I empathize with him. We were both used by
the shinobi world… He can neither forgive himself
nor accept himself for what he truly is. What he is doing is certainly wrong. But he's not completely to blame
for not being able to realize that. My chance has passed, but he can still forgive himself
before he dies. Why would you ever feel
like you need to help him do that? He is not like you.
You were perfect! Sasuke… I tried to control you
with the Visual Jutsu called Koto Amatsukami. I treated you like a child because I thought you
needed my protection. I didn't trust your strength. It may be that a perfect being does not
exist at all in the world. Sometimes two who seem
to be opposites are actually two sides
of the same coin. They can only succeed when
they actually work together. Like the Izanagi and Izanami. Look at me, and find in yourself what
I was unable to find in myself. Do not say I was perfect. First of all… Impossible! I will be a perfect being! This is…not me! How long will you
imitate Orochimaru? If you want to exit this loop,
reexamine your mistakes! Shut up! I know he's going to come at me
with a Fire Style Jutsu. Water Style…
Water Dragon… Water Style…
Water Dragon Missile! He anticipated that jutsu
with Sharingan! How did I get this wrong? Where did I…
make a mistake? All I ever wanted was someone… to appreciate… who I was! All I wanted was to
be acknowledged! Where is the mistake in that?! First of all… you had to accept yourself
as you were. Then you wouldn't have
had to lie to anyone. To you…or to me. If you lie to yourself,
how can you have friends? How can you trust or
be trustworthy? Lies will keep you from
ever seeing your true self. If I wasn't trapped here… I'd have won this war by now. I'd be sleeping by now. Damn you, Itachi! It's 9 o'clock already? Something wrong? No… I just wish we could
wrap this up quickly so I could get a good night's sleep. They never tell us lackeys
what's going on. That's true. So, what are you gonna do
when this war is over? Well, I'll start by going home. If the war ends and the Five Great Nations
continue to be allies… then maybe my little brother who's been
on a mission for a long time, can finally come home. I envy those who have
a home to return to… You want to come with me? Huh? My home is an orphanage. And if my kid brother's back,
he can take a look at your wounds. I appreciate that, Urushi! I really hope
you come back this time… Kabuto. I'll stop the Reanimation Jutsu now. And…all the reanimated dead
will fade away. That should end the war. But… you'll be gone too, Brother. I'll have protected my village as Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf
once again. I have no more regrets. Why?! Why help the very village that
put you where you are now? You may be able to forgive,
but I cannot! You have no more regrets? What about what
you've made me become?! I leave Sasuke to you. I tried to do everything myself…
and I failed. This time… I will leave it
to my comrades. I'm not the one who can
change you, Sasuke. But I can stop this jutsu. That will fulfill my promise
to Naruto, at least. I will stop the Reanimation Jutsu! Tell me the signs! Tsukuyomi! I kept my promise. I leave the rest to you…Naruto. I hate the Leaf Village for causing
you so much pain!

 I hate it more than ever!

 It's because I'm your brother that,

 no matter what you say,
you're not going to stop me!

 Even if you protect the village now,

 I will still destroy it some day.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"I Will Love You Always"


 Good bye…Big Brother.


 I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS


 Tune in again!

 They're too strong! How are we supposed to…? You're right. At this rate… Hokage, your fighting
is getting sloppy! It might not kill you,
but keep fighting like that and you'll only exhaust yourself. I'm putting my life on the line
for this battle! There is no other way! Hokage! No… Damn! How could I… have fallen prey to
Sharingan Genjutsu? Release! Thanks, Tsuchikage. Damn that Ohnoki… His wisdom in battle is
beginning to show… He stopped Susano'o with
the Weighted Boulder Jutsu… and saved the Raikage. Stand, my fellow Kage! No more weakness! Let us look death in
the face together! We are the Five Kage! So choose final words that
will not shame your title! Remember the battle that
we entrusted to Naruto! He entrusted this battle to us and we swore that we would win,
no matter what! And there is one more thing… We cannot betray the trust of
each and every shinobi. We must be worthy
of the title of Kage! So the problem is… Ohnoki, after all. I have no choice
but to break his will. I Will Love You Always

 More, Princess! You don't have to tell me! There's not much chakra left! We must consider this
our last stand. Particle Style!
Boundary Dismantling Jutsu! Releasing Susano'o kept me
from absorbing the Particle Style… I told you the only thing that will
work against me are physical attacks. You think you've eliminated
the clones, and distracted me
with the Particle Style? It's not just sand! If you don't like the sand,
just stop absorbing the jutsu! But then, the Lightning Water Dragon
will paralyze you. And I'll use that moment to
wedge him in with my Particle Style! That will give us enough time
to seal him away! Do you see this? This is the full power
of the Five Kage! I see… This truly is worthy of the shinobi
who bear the name Kage. Then I, Madara Uchiha,
shall also respond with full power! The Five Kage are nothing
compared to me. This is… my Perfect Susano'o! It's massive. Is this… the True Susano'o? Not quite yet… Settle down! The big one's chakra
has settled down… I can't believe the difference
in power… I can't believe Grandfather
fought someone like him! I already told you… Hashirama was the only one
who could stop me. But he's no longer here. Though you could say that
actually works in your favor. That's because… It's just me… So the maps will only need
to be redrawn a little. Impossible! He split the mountain! This is…Madara Uchiha… Then why back then…? Why did you hold back against us? What adult goes full force
when fighting mere children? Besides… Are you finished now? We may be stumbling in the dark, but we're close to the light
at the end of the tunnel! Here, of all places… This Susano'o is destruction incarnate. A single stroke of the blade
contains enough power to smash all things in this universe. It rivals even the Tailed Beasts! Take your philosophy, Five Kage, and be crushed and be gone! Ne, Ushi, Saru, Tora, Tatsu, I…
[Rat, Ox, Monkey, Tiger, Dragon, Boar…] That's it, huh… All right… Ne… [Rat] Ushi… [Ox] Saru… [Monkey] I guess…
it won't matter what I say, will it? When I saw you… I followed you in order
to confirm whether or not Tobi and Danzo
spoke the truth. But that wasn't all I confirmed. When I'm with you,
the past comes flooding back. The feelings I had as a child,
of adoration for my big brother. That's why… the closer I get to you and
how we used to be back then, the more I understand you. And the more I hate the Leaf Village
for causing you so much pain! I hate it more than ever! I know what you want me to do. And because you're my big brother,
you'll disapprove. It's because I'm your brother that,
no matter what you say, you're not going to stop me! Even if you protect the village now…
I will still destroy it someday. Tora… [Tiger] Tatsu… [Dragon] Goodbye. I… [Boar] Reanimation Jutsu… Release! Big Brother… Lord Tsuchikage… It's unfortunate…
But I think this is the end. Silence, Mizukage! I'm not giving up yet! What's going on? Did something happen
to the Jutsu Caster? There's still time… I feel like my consciousness
is slowly fading… I need to tell you everything
before we part. There's no need to lie anymore. The night I left you, I did do everything Danzo
and Tobi told you. I'll show you…the whole truth. These are…
Itachi's memories! It no longer looks like the Uchiha
coup d'etat can be prevented. And if civil war erupts in the Leaf,
other nations are certain to invade. Real war will break out. When I tried to stop the coup d'etat
with the Kotoamatsukami, Danzo stole my right eye. He doesn't trust me. He intends to protect
the village his way, no matter what it takes
or how it looks. I suspect he'll come after
my left eye as well. So I want to give it to you
before he has a chance. Shisui… You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend. Please protect this village…
and the honor of the Uchiha name. We cannot allow such a thing! If they are going to start a revolution
and usurp our power, we have no choice
but to judge the Uchiha as traitors of the Leaf! Wait, Koharu. Don't rush to such a decision. But Hiruzen, the Uchiha Clan
will not be dissuaded. We must take measures
to avoid mayhem. And that includes innocent children. Do not say such things
before Itachi. Besides, taking on the Uchiha
will be no easy task. There's got to be some sort
of strategy we can use! We have no time to waste. We must strike preemptively. If we join forces with
our respective ANBU Black Ops and launch a surprise attack
from behind, it will be over in no time. The Uchiha are old
comrades in arms. I want to settle this
with words first before force. I will come up with a strategy. Itachi… Buy me some time,
however little it may be. Despite what Lord Third said, he will move to protect the Leaf
if push comes to shove. That's the kind of man he is. In which case even Hiruzen,
as Hokage, will have no choice
but to take decisive measures. Whether it results in war or not,
the moment the coup d'etat happens, the Uchiha will lock themselves
into a fate of annihilation. Including your innocent
little brother. However, there is a way to
spare just your little brother prior to the coup d'etat. If things come to pass, your brother will likely come
to know the truth. And if he witnesses Leaf Shinobi
slaughter his entire clan, it will give him a vengeful heart
towards the Leaf. And then unfortunately,
he will have to die as well. Is that a threat? No, I just want you
to make a choice. Either align with the Uchiha, launch the coup d'etat,
and die along with your clan… Or side with the Leaf, save your little brother
before the coup d'etat and then help us eliminate
all other Uchiha. No matter what, things must be quelled before
any mayhem can arise in order to protect the village. And the only shinobi who can be
entrusted with this mission… is you, a double agent
for both the Uchiha and the Leaf. There is no one else…Itachi. This will be the most
painful mission for you. But on the other hand, it will allow your little brother
to be spared. I know you care about the village
as much as I… Will you accept this mission? How do you know about me? You slipped through
extra tight Leaf Security and went to examine
Nakano Shrine's secret stone tablet. Only the Uchiha know its location. Since then, I've kept an eye
on your movements, and looked into what kind of character
you are and what your ideology is. Well then, that saves me time. For you already know
that I bear hatred towards both the Leaf
and my own clan… I have terms. I will help you exact revenge
upon the Uchiha Clan. But you are not to harm
the village itself. Nor…Sasuke Uchiha. I regret now, not telling you everything
before it had come to this. I see… So you've aligned with the other side? Father, Mother… I… I know, Itachi. Itachi, just promise me this. Take care of Sasuke. I will. Do not fear. This is the path you have chosen. Compared to you,
our pain will be over in an instant. Even if our philosophies differ,
I am proud of you. You are truly a kind child. There's nothing more to say. I have told you the whole truth.
I won't have to ever again… I always lied to you and
asked you to forgive me. Deliberately keeping you at
a distance by my own hand. All because I didn't want you
to get caught up in any of this. But now, I believe… that perhaps you could
have changed Father, Mother,
and the rest of the Uchiha. If I had been open with you
from the start… and looked you straight in
the eyes and told you the truth, then I wouldn't have had
to stand before you, from above, as a failure,
telling you all of this. So this time, I want to impart
this truth to you… You don't ever have to forgive me. And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this… I will love you always. Naruto, the Jinchuriki
are gonna quit it!

 Looks like Itachi did it!

 Thanks, Itachi!

 Then this means
the other battles are…

 Curse Kabuto, he's failed.

 Hey, what are you looking at?
We're still fighting!

 Looks like the Reanimation Jutsu
has been released.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Reanimation Jutsu: Release!"

 So what of it? REANIMATION JUTSU: RELEASE!


 Tune in again!

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,930
Won't you reconsider this
one more time? Reconsider what? The issue regarding Naruto! It's too risky to allow Naruto
to take part in this mission. If something were to happen... Don't make me say it again! Team Kakashi, with Naruto and Sakura,
will handle this mission. I've explained my reasoning! I understand that... But...it's not really "Team Kakashi"
because he can't even go with them! The situation is different from when
we dispatched them to the Hidden Sand! <i>That's true...</i> You'll probably get mad if I say this. But <i>I'll</i>  take care of that Jinchuriki. <i>In the previous mission,
<i>the enemy was clearly after Naruto...</i> Wait! Hey! <i>We were able to prevent that
<i>because we had Kakashi Sensei with us,</i> <i>who knows Naruto very well...</i> Naruto! <i>But we won't have Kakashi Sensei
<i>on this mission...</i> <i>It's understandable that
<i>Shizune would be concerned...</i> Don't worry, Sakura. That point has been taken
under consideration... I'll find two members to fill in the holes
left by Kakashi and Sasuke. Make sure to tell Naruto as well! Yes, ma'am... Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll. Naruto! Just keep charging at him! <i>Ninja Art: Shadow Sewing!</i> Who the heck...are you...? Lady Tsunade... I'm on my way... Tsunade... I need to speak with you...
Let me see you for a moment. <i>Formation! New Team Kakashi


</i> What did you want to talk about? Since you two advisors are here,
this probably isn't going to be pleasant! As it happens... Shizune recently came to us
seeking our advice... What do you want to talk about? It's about Naruto Uzumaki. From now on,
do not assign missions with a possibility of contact with
the Akatsuki to Naruto Uzumaki... You know...the reason, don't you? Yeah... I've been hearing about it
from Shizune. From here on, make sure he works in a four-man squad
with more skilled Shinobi and increase surveillance on him
as well as protection. Furthermore, you should decrease
the amount of missions you assign him as much as possible, and limit the scope of his activities. Got it, Tsunade...? If Shizune has asked for your advice... then you should know
what my answer will be. <i>Lady Tsunade...</i> No way! Tsunade...
Naruto's not just an ordinary kid. He's a Jinchuriki! Under normal circumstances,
the logical thing to do would be to keep him
in the village and under surveillance... It may not sound like it,
but this is a compromise. I agree that he should work
in a four-man squad. But Naruto shouldn't have
so many restrictions placed on him! Even if we keep Naruto in the village, the Akatsuki will definitely come after him,
come after the Jinchuriki... Even in the recent incident
in the Hidden Sand Village, they went after Gaara, the Jinchuriki,
even though he was in what was considered
the safest location in the village. There's a strong possibility that
they'll take a similarly hard-line approach in regards to Naruto as well. If that happens, at the end of the day,
the Leaf Village will be in danger as well. If Naruto stays on the move, the enemy won't immediately be able
to figure out what he's doing. First of all, Naruto does have talent... He's a Shinobi who should be
a great asset to the Leaf Village. That's a pathetic objection, Tsunade.
You call yourself the Hokage? I'm trying to compromise too, you know! Then can you ensure that,
until then, Naruto won't get taken out
by the Akatsuki?! And can you ensure that if the Akatsuki
take the Nine-Tails from Naruto, it won't bring about bigger calamity
for the Leaf Village?! <i>As promised in that bet,
<i>that unlucky necklace...will be mine.</i> <i>That's enough!
<i>Don't protect me anymore, Naruto!</i> I told you...That kind of stubbornness
will get you killed! If you die, you'll have nothing...
No dreams or anything! That's enough! Move! Run! It'll be okay... Until... Until I become the Hokage,
there's no way will I die! Here's a spell that makes
dreams come true. Naruto...won't be beaten! I believe that... If...that judgment turns out
to be mistaken... what will you do? If perchance, the Hidden Leaf Village
and the Land of Fire become endangered
by my decision... then as the Fifth Hokage,
I will protect them with my life! Very well... If you're willing to go that far,
do as you like. However... In exchange for that,
you will use the Shinobi we select as the additional members
of the four-man squad. Fine. Danzo... Come on in! You're... Long time no see...
Princess Tsunade. To think <i>you'd</i>  show up... I see... So the new team members
will be from The Foundation, huh...? You're sure weak. Are you sure you have any
"balls" with that kind of skill? Wha--?! You little! I asked... who the heck you are! We'll be seeing
each other again...Naruto. Hold it! Who was that...? Choji! I thought you'd be here! For crying out loud! Asuma Sensei's angry and
wants you to get a move on! Sorry, Ino...
We got attacked by some weirdo... Some weirdo...? By weirdo, do you mean...
Isn't that Naruto?! No... when I said weirdo,
I didn't mean Naruto... Naruto! Long time no see! - Don't bother, Choji.
- How have you been! This atmosphere's such a pain...
- Hey, you've gotta tell me your stories! So you will be arranging
the two additional team members? No... Just one member... So you also weren't expecting
the team leader, Kakashi... to be out of action, huh...? Since Kakashi Hatake is
recuperating right now, an additional member will be required
on Team Kakashi's next mission. And we don't have much time
until the mission. This should be left up to you,
Lady Tsunade... Kakashi's withdrawal is unexpected
for me as well... I was just at the point of wondering
what should be done... Then you should select
someone very skilled from the Anbu Black Ops under
your direct control to lead the team. Yes! That would be good. You've no objections, right, Tsunade? Leave the selection to me.
Is that okay with you...? How about it, Danzo...? Then, I'll do it as I please... L-Lady Tsunade...! Geez, I don't like this! I-I'm very sorry... But I had absolutely no intention
of betraying you... I'm not talking about you! What...? I'm talking about that man. <i>I'd also thought of having someone</i> <i>from the Anbu Black Ops
<i>under my direct control replace Kakashi.</i> <i>I have someone specific in mind...</i> <i>But...I never thought they'd
<i>suggest that from their end.</i> <i>I totally thought they were
<i>going to force</i> <i>one of their own subordinates on me...</i> <i>Does this mean one person
<i>is enough for the surveillance of Naruto?</i> <i>Or...are they after something else?</i> Uh...Umm...Lady Tsunade...? Of course, I've got tons of things
I want to say to <i>you</i> ! Yikes! That said, the formation of Team Kakashi
is a more immediate concern. You're going to work really hard! Oh, y-yes, ma'am! That was fast... I heard it was a matter of urgency... You know why you're here, right? I have a general idea. I want you to take Kakashi's place. It's an honor to be able to work
in Kakashi Senpai's stead... This isn't an Anbu Black Ops mission.
It will be a regular mission. Therefore, take off that mask
and I will give you a codename. During this mission,
you'll be known as "Yamato." I understand... An additional member... a new recruit from
the Anbu Black Ops Training Division will be dispatched to Team Kakashi. From the...Foundation? However... What is it? Keep a close watch on his actions. What...do you mean? Danzo recommended this new recruit. The man called Danzo... used to be in the Taka faction that
opposed the Third Hokage... He formed the Anbu Black Ops
Training Division as a detached unit within
the Anbu Black Ops and took the position of chief. I'm sure you've at least heard
of his name, right? The Foundation has since been
disbanded and he has fallen from power. But I still can't figure out
what he's thinking... Perhaps you're worrying too much...? Never mind... Meet up with the team immediately. Yes, ma'am! Hey, Sakura! This is the spot...
where we're supposed to meet, right? Yeah... No doubt about it. Nobody's here yet, considering... Did Granny Tsunade really arrange
new members for us? It'll be okay. We just got here
a little too early, that's all. We've still got a little bit before
the meeting time. I hope they don't turn out to
have the habit of showing up late like Kakashi Sensei... Hi... Hey! It's you! You're the guy who was up
on the roof earlier... Umm...as of now I will be... taking Kakashi's place in
Team Kakashi and... <i>This is going to be a nasty mission.</i> Our mission is to capture
the Akatsuki spy who has infiltrated
Orochimaru's organization at Tenchi Bridge and bring him back. This is an opportunity for us to obtain information on
both Orochimaru and Sasuke Uchiha. If things go well, we will obtain
a precious source of information with which we can draw up plans for both the assassination of Orochimaru
and the retrieval of Sasuke. Keep your wits about you and be sure to proceed through
this operation with caution. Next episode:
 "An Unnecessary Addition"


 - Roger!
- Roger! Reanimation Jutsu: Release!"


 All right! We've cornered him! Just when I thought
I regained consciousness, this happens… What's that?! You're strong, after all…
Pakura Sensei. Maki…? Pakura Sensei?! Let me out! I've had it! I'm completely fed up! I'm gonna explode, hmm! You okay with that, huh? We got you sealed
with the Lightning Style, especially so you can't explode. So shut your trap! You dud! There are no such things
as duds in art! Huh?! No way, an explosion?! What is it?! What is this? Dan! Yeah. Looks like someone succeeded. Naruto! The Jinchuriki are
gonna quit it! Looks like Itachi did it! Thanks, Itachi! But this battle ain't going anywhere! No time to waste! Let's go! Tell Ohnoki… He must secure the future of
the Allied Shinobi Forces… Only then can he come
and tell me all about it… Just what the hell is going on? I get it… The bookworm's been
taken down…hmm. It was a dud.
Don't scare us like that. It wasn't a dud! Art is… indestructible! Scaring us like that… Granny Chiyo! Looks like I'm free
of the cursed spell. Pakura Sensei! Maki, do not die in vain! Sensei… You all have a future… Looks like I can finally die… Granny Chiyo! Kankuro… I entrust you with the techniques
of the Puppet Master. I accept and will take it over…
Granny Chiyo. No need to play possum anymore! As expected, I can control
my body freely now. Choza, please undo the barrier. It's safe now. It seems that way… Everyone, there's no need
for the barrier. Right! Choza, forgive me. Those signs are for the Ghost
Transformation Jutsu, aren't they? I understand. Please hurry to
Lady Tsunade's side! This jutsu has killed so many shinobi… I couldn't have imagined that
it would come in handy like this! Ghost Transformation Jutsu! Just as I thought! Souls ascending after being released
from the Reanimation Jutsu can be controlled with this jutsu too. But it doesn't seem like
you have much time. Please hurry! Yeah… Farewell, Choza!
Thank you for everything! Amazing… He flew off like a ghost! Just what is the Ghost
Transformation Jutsu? It allows one to become
a living ghost that can span long distances
to kill a foe… Originally, that is. Tsunade… Reform is necessary for
the future of our village. In order to keep the lives sacrificed…
to a minimum. You're right. Help me, Tsunade. If I can be of help to you… I need you. Dan… Let's make our dreams come true! Yes. Our dreams as shinobi. What's going on? Reanimation chakra is
fading steadily! We have reports coming in
from each battlefield. The reanimated are turning
into souls. Even the sealed ones,
even ones still fighting! The only way to explain
the situation is that… the Reanimation has been released… There's no mistake. The Reanimation Jutsu
has been released! All right! Relay this news to every company! Reporting from Headquarters. The Reanimation has been released. I repeat! The Reanimation Jutsu
has been undone! Amazing! They're all disappearing! But… Which company managed to do this? You don't ever have to forgive me. And no matter what you do
from here on out… I will love you always. I… Yugito… Yagura… Han… Utakata… Fuu… Old Man Beard! Just leave it to us! They're gone. Then this means
the other battles are… Curse Kabuto, he's failed. Hey, what are you looking at?! You're fighting me! As well as the Green Beast! Looks like the Reanimation
has been released. And… what of it? What is…that light? The Susano'o is gone and now… the debris from the Reanimation
is in a fierce whirlwind. Without a doubt, this means… The Reanimation has been released. What?! We haven't located Kabuto yet. It's too soon! Even if Kabuto was found,
to be able to stop this jutsu…? Who could have done this? It doesn't matter! Whoever did it is a hero
who's saved the Shinobi World! The heavens haven't forsaken us yet! It appears you have able shinobi
on your side too. It can't be helped… He was prepared for this? Not yet! He's planning a final strike
before he disappears! Watch out! Fire Style: Dragon Flame Caterwaul! Water Style… No… It won't make it in time! Lady Hokage! I'm all right! The 100 Healings Jutsu has worn off! But… we've won… Damn! What was that?! I thought she completely
lost consciousness! I couldn't move anymore…
So how? It's been a long time…Tsunade. It's me, Dan. Dan… How are you here?! The Reanimation has
been undone. And I flew over here with
my Ghost Transformation Jutsu. But that was a close one! Dan… You haven't changed at all…Tsunade. Dan… I have always honored your… There's no time to wallow
in sentimentalities. I have to go. But… Fighting and losing
precious people… is not all there is to
being a shinobi. I love this village and my comrades. So I want to protect them. A person that protects everyone… Becoming the Hokage
is my dream. Dan! I ran from my memories
of you for a long time, after your death. But I've changed! And now… I can confirm with you
what all your regrets and the things you wanted
to do were! I've become the Hokage! But… Thank you, Tsunade. You are fulfilling my dreams
for me just fine. I really caused you a lot of pain. I'm sorry. I'll be waiting for you on the other side. But don't come too quickly, okay? For you yourself are my dream. I was able to protect you at the end… It appears a little bit of good did come
from being reanimated. Hokage, are you all right?! Your vitality has returned. And you received chakra? I got to see an old friend
for just a little while… Well, you'll meet again right away. What? What's going on anyway? Madara's chakra which had begun to separate from his body
is now clinging firmly to it. Is he back to his original state? Why? Why won't he disappear?! I thought the Reanimation
was undone! Reanimation is a jutsu that
summons the dead. However, there is one risk… Risk? As long as one knows the signs, the reanimated dead can
rescind the Reanimation Contract from their end. Rescind the contract?! When that happens, you end up with
the biggest problem of all. An immortal body with infinite chakra…
that can move without control. Impossible! Tell the jutsu caster… Never use a Forbidden Jutsu carelessly. Reanimation, release! What is a clan? What is a village? What is…a shinobi? What am I? Found you! You guys…? What're you doing here? Stopping the Reanimation. Huh? You've always been like that. You never explain things to people. Well, it's been awhile
since we saw you, so you'd better tell us! What? It's Kabuto… Huh? Kabuto was using the Reanimation. How… How can that be…? Your ridiculously juvenile jutsu
can't hold me. You should know that
after fighting me, right? Now then… The Perfect Susano'o… Everyone who sees it dies…
or so they say. I'm almost embarrassed
to have to do this again. I already used it once… My interest has waned,
thanks to the interference. Perhaps I ought to go
retrieve Nine Tails instead. What? Let us deal with this Madara! I swear we shall finish him off! So relax and leave him to us! Lord Tsuchikage! We cannot stop him. We still have to fight! We must stop him here! So sad… Lightning Cable! Guy! Right! Take this! Pinky Attack! Heh! You don't look too happy! What's that supposed to mean? Since you're hiding your face,
I can only guess. If you feel insulted,
take off that mask and show us how composed you are! Stupid! Nice going, Naruto! I told him not to rile up his opponent. Well… It seems I have
no choice but to use it. What is that?! A giant gourd and a bottle… Frankly, I wanted to revive this
when the conditions were perfect. It's only a fragment,
but it's not lacking in power. It's taking too long. It's time! We found something incredible
in one of the hideouts.

 Take a look at this!

 This is it! Someone
who is all-knowing.

 I have to meet up with someone.
I'm leaving.

 Huh? Who?

 Orochimaru.

 What are you talking about?
You killed Orochimaru!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Orochimaru's Return"

 Don't underestimate Orochimaru.


 OROCHIMARU'S RETURN


 Tune in again!

 Orochimaru's Return


 This is Kabuto? He's kind of gross, huh? This one coming out of
his gut looks like a huge— Just leave him be. She's alive. What do you want with me
at this point? Why'd you go out of your way
to look for me? Oh yeah! That's right. See… We found something incredible
in one of the hideouts. Now let's see… Earlier, you said that you and Itachi
stopped the Reanimation, right? But I don't think it worked
on the reanimated Madara. No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within the village, I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf! You're the only person
I can count on, my best friend. Please protect this village…
and the honor of the Uchiha name. I told you,
there's something I must do. I see. So it hasn't been stopped. I'm talking to Sasuke!
Don't interrupt me. Anyway, never mind that. Look! Look, look! See! Amazing, right?! With this, we Taka can rule
the shinobi world! This is it… The human who's all-knowing… I have to meet up with someone. I'm leaving. Huh? Who? Orochimaru. Huh?! What are you talking about? You killed Orochimaru! I thought you would use this to… Are you really surprised someone as
tenacious as Orochimaru might not be killed so easily? And even if I do find him vile… I need him to do something for me. The clan… The village… It's time to see the all-knowing. What do you mean,
“see” Orochimaru? Who is this all-knowing person? You don't need to know. What? I don't get it. In any case, Orochimaru must never be resurrected! You probably want to ask
Orochimaru for help in using the power of the scroll, right? Just give it time and
you'll figure it out. That's why we looked for you and… There are still things only
Orochimaru can do. Sasuke, tell me… You were Orochimaru's
favorite pupil, right? So why can't you…? Suigetsu! Listen. Huh? What? Don't underestimate Orochimaru. Idiot! I don't underestimate him! It's the exact opposite! You were able to bring
down Orochimaru only because both his arms were useless from
the Reaper Death Seal, that's all. You're the one
who's underestimating him! Even if he is revived,
his arms will probably still be useless. But he'll still be dangerous. He's going to come after
your body again! If he finds out about this war,
he's going to want to be a part of it. He wants to destroy the Leaf too! And that means that Team Taka
will get mixed up in this war! Are you okay with that? We succeeded in beating
our superiors. It's our time now! Who'd want to see Orochimaru now? Hasn't he caused us
enough trouble? Shut up, Suigetsu. Cut out and bring me
a piece of Kabuto's flesh. Huh? You don't listen to me,
but you expect me to listen to you? I'll do it. It's always like this… Jugo, are you okay with this? Orochimaru's going to
be resurrected, you know… I don't care. Sasuke's will is Kimimaro's will. I will abide by it. You're just the same. What is going on with all of this? In my village,
we call it Sage Transformation. My transformation originally
was the same thing. But in all of my clones, it's called
the Curse Mark Transformation. I'm going to seal your Curse Mark. Curse Sealing! So the reverse of it is:
Curse Unsealing! Who could have imagined… that it would be you who
would facilitate my return! H-Hello there! Long time no see. Orochimaru, there's something
I want you to do for me. Don't bother explaining. I've been watching from
inside Anko this whole time. I secured My Sage Jutsu Chakra
into those Curse Marks. They are like pieces of
my consciousness. Then you know about the war too? Of course. I just have one thing to say
about that, Suigetsu. Huh? I have absolutely no interest
in this war. Huh?! It's someone else's war. The only thing I'm interested
in right now… Sasuke… is your young body! I told you! Having said that, I don't currently
have the power to steal it. I wouldn't be so sure… What is your intent
in meeting with them? There's too much that I don't know. So I plan to ask them everything. Everything? There's no need to know it all. You're still a child. You're wrong. I treated you like a child… I only tried to protect you.
I didn't trust your strength. But now, I believe… that perhaps you could have
changed Father, Mother, and the rest of the Uchiha. If I had been open
with you from the start… and looked you straight in the eyes
and told you the truth. I'm not a child anymore. I can't stay a child. And no matter what you do
from here on out… I want to know what started it all. What I'm supposed to be,
what I'm supposed to do. Are you questioning
your vengeance? No… Not my quest for
vengeance itself. Reuniting with Itachi
made my hatred towards the Hidden Leaf
grow even stronger. It's just… I want to understand
how even in death, Itachi could still consider
himself a Leaf Shinobi, and care about and
try to protect the village that dishonored his name. Who was Itachi? What is a clan?
What is a village? And so… I want to know everything,
so I can finally have the answer. I need to see with my own eyes and decide with my own mind
what I must do. He's no longer the Sasuke
who was manipulated by Itachi… or me…or Tobi. What a strange sensation. He's going to absorb all of
Kabuto's power, and then kill him! You better stay alert. He might try and catch you
off guard too! The current you…isn't half bad. Didn't I tell you?
He did absorb his power! No, you're wrong. He undid the Sage Transformation. He's taken back his own chakra
that was inside Kabuto. He didn't touch Kabuto's chakra. Fine, I'll help you. Come along. Where are we going? Someplace you're very familiar with. Let's be on our way. The statue's been acting weird
since it swallowed something earlier. That was… Don't tell me… I would have preferred
resurrecting it in a completed state but… Watch closely and feel it
through your skin… The return of Ten Tails! And the beginning of the end! So that's it! That statue was
the Ten Tails' actual body! Huh?! What's Ten Tails?! But what's going on? When he declared war at
the Five Kage Summit… The purpose of this war
was to collect all nine Tailed Beasts' chakra
in order to revive Ten Tails. He doesn't possess Eight Tails
or Nine Tails yet… Is he bluffing? It's too risky to get up close. Oh… Only a fragment,
but it is not lacking in power. Have we given him one tentacle
arm's worth of chakra? We're always dropping rhymes But maybe we messed up big time… Yay! The chakra from a tentacle
was taken, just a little I may not look it
I admit I'm flustered a bit He took the chakra from one
of Eight Tails' tentacle arms… Does that mean only a portion
of a Tailed Beast is sufficient? Naruto… You felt it too, didn't you? That was my chakra in
that bottle and gourd. Yup… Let me take over, Naruto. I'll explain. About Ten Tails too.
You listen from in here. You know about Ten Tails, Kurama? Yeah, of course. Listen up, everyone! Hmm? That voice! Naruto switched places
with Nine Tails, pow! He'll explain everything to us… Nine Tails and Naruto
are tight now! If even just a portion of
the Tailed Beast is sufficient… Then that statue already has a piece of Eight Tails' and
my chakra inside it. The Nine Tails too?! The bottle and gourd that guy
summoned and fed to the statue just now were two of Old Man
Six Paths' treasured tools. They both possess powerful
Sealing Jutsu that can seal away anything
and everything. Once you get put inside either
one of them, you can't get out,
no matter what. So… Sealed inside the bottle
was a guy named Kinkaku. And Ginkaku was sealed
inside the gourd. I suspect they were reanimated
using the Reanimation Jutsu, used in the war and
then sealed away. Kinkaku and Ginkaku,
and the Sage of the Six Paths… They're all legendary names… But what's the connection
with Nine Tails' chakra? There was a time when
the brothers challenged me to a battle. Naturally, I devoured them. However… They survived and fed on me
from the inside and absorbed my chakra. So Kinkaku and Ginkaku
had some of your chakra. And the masked guy took them
as insurance, for the revival of the Ten Tails… from Darui's First Company. That's consistent with
the report we got from HQ. But given that they're just fragments
of Eight Tails' and my chakra, who knows what form or shape
the revived Ten Tails will take. We must act before Ten Tails
fully comes back to life. Kakashi… You speak your mind
way too easily. You're a man for whom
a life full of regrets is fitting! Just…who the hell are you anyway? What's the point in telling someone
who can't remember faces? Kakashi, like you said,
if we're going to make a move, now's the chance, before
the Ten Tails is revived fully. Old Man Six Paths used to say
that Ten Tails' full revival would signify the end of the world. Is the Ten Tails really that terrible? I get that he's got Ten Tails,
but just how powerful is he? He's the aggregate of the chakra
of all the Tailed Beasts, One Tail through me. He was the beginning of chakra
and a creator-god of many nations. Amenohitotsunokami…
Datara… Deidarabotchi… He has many names. He drank oceans,
split open the earth, and hoisted up mountains… He is the progenitor who is said
to have created this very land. Simply put, he has the total power
of all nine Tailed Beasts. Honestly, I couldn't take him on
by myself and hope to win. But if he only has a piece
of Eight Tails and me, who has the most chakra
out of the nine… it might be worth a try. You're all mistaken. For me, the revival of Ten Tails
doesn't need to be complete. My end goal is a Super Genjutsu… The Infinite Tsukuyomi! I will put every human on
this planet under a single genjutsu… A single world that belongs
to nobody. One perfect world
without war or ill feelings. Only within a single
collective consciousness… where the individual has been
cast aside, can truth be found! The world no longer needs hope,
a future or famous heroes. Even if incomplete,
once Ten Tails is revived, the Infinite Tsukuyomi Jutsu
can be achieved. Then reality will come to an end… And all that will exist will be
a single unending dream… that will last for all eternity! Kurama, switch back! I had Dad, Mom, and Pervy Sage. Kids love looking up to their hero. That's why I can keep running
forward without hesitation. I will become
the greatest Hokage of them all! That's my dream, you idiot! Even if you don't want
your youth to end, dreams must come to
an end at some point! Yeah… Dreams must be fulfilled. Dreams, dreams,
lots o' dreams abound I dream of grown women's boobs…
So round! When dreams are fulfilled,
that's where truth is found! You've got guts, Bee… Telling us about your preferences
at a time like this… Individuality makes you
lose sight of the truth. My words as a nobody… are words guided by
the truth of the world. Your window of opportunity is the instant
he tries to suck you inside himself.

 That's when he'll be solid.

 If you try to attack him normally,
you'll just pass right through him.

 Go for a counterattack!

 Create an opening through
continuous close combat!

 Avoid using big moves!

 I know!
That's why I created a clone!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Secret of the Transportation Technique"

 Naruto! Just keep going!


 THE SECRET OF
THE TRANSPORTATION TECHNIQUE


 Tune in again!

 I had Dad, Mom, and Pervy Sage. Kids love looking up to their hero. That's why I can keep running
forward without hesitation. I will become the greatest Hokage
of them all! That's my dream! I guess cracking that mask of yours
will have to come first. You will not touch the statue! The Secret of
the Transportation Technique

 Naruto! You know about
his abilities, right? Your window of opportunity
is the instant he tries to suck you inside himself. That's when he's solid. If you attack him normally,
you'll just pass right through him. So it's like you're aiming
for a counterattack. Diversionary tactics are a must. Create an opening through
continuous close combat! Avoid using big moves! I know!
That's why I made a clone! Bee! Please raise me up high! I'm good to go. We should avoid attacks
that touch him directly. Up you go! Super Mini Tailed Beast Bomb! Mangekyo Sharingan! Twin Fangs! This one! I guess not.
Then it must be… Nice timing! I'll deal with you… first! That's so cool,
Bushier Brow Sensei! Okay! I've infused more
than enough chakra! Sorry, but… I'm going for the statue! Kamui! If I gouge out its head… it shouldn't be able to survive,
statue or not! So naïve. What happened? Don't tell me… He vanished? Naruto! These boulders are in the way!
Damn it! Bee! I've got it! Fly! He cut through that boulder
with his Lightning Blade. Nice, Kakashi! I'm not going to make it in time! Naruto! Just keep going! I'll take care of the kunai! Kamui! Damn it! He's really strong.
I can't get my attacks to hit him. Are you all right? Yeah… But if even that attack is no good… What can we do?! What's happening all of
a sudden? Hey, Kakashi…
Did you see that? – Yeah.
– Huh? There's a crack in his mask. Huh? Where, where?! You're right… On the left side! Looks like Naruto's earlier attack
grazed him before it passed through! Nice going, Naruto!
Let's keep it up just like that! All right! Now I feel like
we have a chance! To be honest, it didn't look to me
like Naruto's attack landed. You're doing it again… You always say things like that! Are you saying
it was something else? What's going on? From the looks of it, that crack isn't from
Naruto's punch. It looks like it was cut
with something sharp… Wait a minute! You're wide open! Don't mock me! Uchiha Flame Formation! Hot! Hot! Hot! Whoa! Are you all right,
Octopops and Eight-o?! Do I look all right? Now that he's erected a barrier, we have no choice but
to tackle the masked guy first. That's been my plan since
the beginning, y'know! Damn it! Could it be…? No…
That's impossible… But… I'd never heard that the Kamui
could be stopped! But if the crack in his mask was caused by the kunai
I used my Kamui on… That means his ninjutsu is… It's no use just thinking about it. It's an implausible theory,
but it's not impossible, either… Guy, Naruto, Bee… – Yeah?
– Hmm? There's something I want to test. Help me out. Let's do it! Okay! Yo! Impressive destructive power. How's that?! You don't have any time
to suck me in, do you?! You underestimate
the Sharingan too much. I can read your movements. I'll keep these. He materializes while
he absorbs things. Now! Rasengan! Don't you understand
that it's futile? It's just like you said, Kakashi Sensei! I don't really understand why, but I finally landed
an attack on him! I see… Naruto didn't undo
his Rasengan… Kakashi… You used the Kamui
to send the Rasengan away. I knew it… I thought he had
two different jutsu, one that lets him slip
through things and one to suck things in
or take them out. But that's not the case. – Huh?
– Huh? It's all one single jutsu! It's one jutsu? Yeah. Well, no one's better at jutsu analysis
and breakdown than you. Can you explain his jutsu
to us in simpler terms? Knowing what it is might change
how we approach the battle. The way his jutsu works
is really simple… You see, the jutsu he uses
to absorb things, and the one he uses
to slip through objects is the Transportation Technique. What do you mean?
How can you tell? Well… Let me explain it
in order. First, the crack in his mask. My kunai made that mark.
I'm absolutely certain. From the look of the wound
on his right shoulder, I can tell it was caused from being hit
by Naruto's Rasengan just now. What these two things have
in common is that they both involve areas of his body
that were overlapping and in contact with Naruto's body
while he was slipping through him. There is another thing that
the two have in common. That is… A kunai and Rasengan
that I transported using my Kamui Jutsu
caused those two things. In other words, from this, I can tell his Transportation
Technique is linked to the same time-space
as my Kamui! W-Wait a second!
What do you mean? How come his Visual Jutsu
and yours are linked?! Are all Transportation Techniques…
linked between all users? No… They aren't…
I suspect it's just him and me. Never mind that! Why did your kunai hit
and not my punch? That's right, fool! Even with shared time-spaces, it should still be impossible
to hit a guy that can slip through things,
ya fool. Except that our theory that
he slips through things was wrong. What do you mean? Although it looks like your attack
slipped right through him, in fact, only the part of his body
that would have been in contact with yours
was transported into time-space. In other words,
the left side of his mask that your punch "slipped through"
was simply transported into time-space and
no longer existed on this plane. At least materially. And then almost simultaneously, remember I hurled that kunai
into time-space using Kamui? Just as his momentum
carried him forward when he extended his arm
toward you to grab you… my kunai finished entering time-space
and scored his mask. Did the same thing happen
with the Rasengan? Yeah… So that's what happened. But how come both of
your Visual Prowess's are linked? Kakashi, is he…? Where did you get that eye?! Where, huh? If anything,
in the last Great War. The Battle of Kannabi Bridge… The same battle where you earned
the nickname "The Sharingan Hero." Are you…? I thought I told you not
to flap your mouth so readily! You're just all talk now!
Your words are worthless! It's too late for regrets. Reality just keeps cruelly
moving ahead. You've seen reality,
so you ought to know. Not one wish ever gets granted
in this world. That's why I'm guiding it to
the dream of Infinite Tsukuyomi. I'm going to create a world
where it won't be necessary for a hero to pathetically make excuses
in front of a grave. Hey, are you all right, Kakashi?! You bastard! Are you still blabbing on
about that?! I thought I told you too! I'm not giving up my dream
of becoming Hokage! I've been entrusted with way too much
from way too many! Naruto! Heh! Entrusted, eh? What if you were to lose the things Jiraiya and the Fourth Hokage
entrusted you with? I wonder what they would think? I'm always thinking that I want to do something
about this hatred. But I'm not sure
how to go about it yet. If I can't find the answer myself, I shall pass the quest
on to you! I'm glad I made you
my student! FOURTH HOKAGE You have to find
the answer yourself.

FOURTH HOKAGE Even I don't know it. I know you'll find the answer. I believe in you. Naruto, if you fail at the things
you were entrusted with… I wonder what you will think
of yourself as well? If you postpone dealing
with problems and cover it up with the word "hope," all that awaits you is
an empty reality. Both the entrusted and those that
did the entrusting, all in vain. I sealed half of
the Nine Tails' chakra inside of you, because I believed
you could control its power. Because you are my son. Naruto, switch with me! There's something I want
to say to him. Sorry, but your words
don't apply to this guy. Is that Nine Tails? The Fourth Hokage entrusted him
with me. Not only has Naruto
befriended me… but he's completely mastered
my power as well! The Fourth Hokage sealed me
within Naruto as a force to help take you down. Go, Naruto! You won't fail! Yeah! That man, he couldn't be…

 There's absolutely no way!

 Kakashi, I've got a pretty good idea
of what you're thinking right now.

 But leave it be.

 There's no time to wallow
in sentimentality.

 Your former subordinate Naruto
has already jumped into action!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Who Are You?"

 How stupid, jumping in alone.

 WHO ARE YOU?

 Tune in again!

 Go… Naruto. You won't fail! Yeah! That power again, huh? Kakashi, we ought to—! That man, he couldn't be… No… – Kakashi…
– There's absolutely no way! Kakashi! Are you listening? The more diversions,
the better when attacking him! We have to join the fight! I've got a pretty good idea
of what you're thinking right now. I feel the same way… But leave it be. There's no time to wallow
in sentimentality. Your former subordinate, Naruto,
has already jumped into action! How stupid, jumping in alone! Yo! Yo! Damn it! I'm not alone! Don't forget Kurama! There's also Octopops and Eight-o… Bushier Brow Sensei! And Kakashi Sensei too! You've got a winning record
against me right now… This better not be enough
to slow you down… Kakashi! Naruto… I'm glad you were
my subordinate! Let's go…Guy! My dear rival! That's what I'm talking about! Considering my remaining chakra… I only have a few shots left. I do not fear a borrowed power that can't even string together
a barrage. The true power of Kamui… This Kamui… I will not miss… – Now watch and learn!
– my timing! Their knowing the trick to
my jutsu changes nothing. If he has to materialize
when he takes things in, he has to do so when
he spits things out too! This is our chance! That's if you can counterstrike! What is this? Naruto! These have Curse Marks on them
that restrain Tailed Beast power. Whatever you do, don't touch it! Octopops! Could you shield me for a bit? Shadow Clone Jutsu! All right, come here!
I'll be your umbrella! Kamui! If it's that same trick again, all I need to do is not have
Naruto slip through me. What? A Shadow Clone? Kakashi! Seems my attack was
quicker than you, Kakashi. You missed transporting away
the Rasengan… …and wasted another Kamui. Not yet! Tailed Beast Bomb! A bit late. How futile. You're—! Naruto Uzumaki! I see, so that Kamui just now
wasn't transporting the Rasengan, but the Shadow Clone itself! He beat me to it…
Damn you, Kakashi! Who… Damn it! …are you?! Who Are You?

[TOP OF CERTIFICATE] PLAN BY KAKASHI'S CLASSMATES
TO OBTAIN GIFTS TO CELEBRATE
HIS PROMOTION TO JONIN.
TOP SECRET MISSION. As of today, Kakashi is
a jonin just like me. Remember, we were talking
about this just the other day, Obito? When we discussed
getting Kakashi a gift! Sorry. I guess I wasn't listening. Well, I got you this.
A custom-made kunai. It's a little heavy and unconventional. But you'll get used to it quickly. Thank you. I got you this! Here! A personalized med kit for you. I just adjusted a few things
to make it easier to use. Thank you. What are you holding
your hand out for? Kakashi's father,
Sakumo, took his own life after everyone around him
vilified him. This is where we go our separate ways. Let's get going… Captain. Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! We'll be taking this one with us. Do you have any idea
what you're saying, Kakashi?! Yeah… The two of us have to complete
the mission alone. And Rin? What do we do
about Rin, huh? We'll come back for her later. We must carry out our mission
even at the expense of our comrades. You're right. In the Ninja World, those who break the rules and
laws are regarded as scum. But… those who would abandon
even one of their friends, are far worse than scum. Found them! Kakashi? Why did you—? Well, I certainly can't leave this up
to a crybaby ninja like you, can I? Kakashi… Obito, behind you! My eye…! Kakashi! Hey, Kakashi! Are you all right?! B-But how? There's no way that
you could've seen me! Obito… How did you…?! Release! Kakashi… Obito… This is bad! Whatever the village
or anyone else may say… I think that you're a great jonin… It's true, that's how I feel. Please accept this… Is that you…Obito? Are you really Obito? I thought you died! There's no mistake. That's Obito Uchiha… You can call me by
that name if you want. It means nothing to me. My eye! Kakashi! Obito… How did you…?! This time,
I will protect my comrade! But that day, you… Run for the exit! Kakashi! You guys all right? Rin? Kakashi? Obito! No, don't. It's okay, Kakashi. I don't think…I'll make it. My right side is completely crushed. I can't even feel anything
there anymore. So what if I'm captain now?! So what if I made jonin?! Oh, that's right, I totally forgot… I was the only one… who didn't give you
a gift for making jonin, Kakashi. I'm giving you my Sharingan. Kakashi, take care of Rin… I will. Obito! Obito… You're alive… Who is he? He was our classmate and
an Uchiha who was a Leaf Shinobi. We all thought he was killed
in action during the last war. If you survived, why didn't you
come forward sooner? It's irrelevant whether
I had survived or not. Although, I suppose… If you really want an answer… It's because… you let Rin… die. Relax… Besides, what's with
that look, Kakashi? You're not going to condemn me? What would I gain from criticizing
this absurd reality at this point? I have no interest in the affairs of a world that shall
soon cease to exist. Kakashi Sensei! I don't know what went down
between you two, but this is no time to be depressed! We can discuss it later! Right now, stopping what this guy
is trying to do comes first! Naruto! Kakashi! Naruto is absolutely right! The fate of this world currently
rests in our hands! I have nothing more
to talk to you about. Stay tied down to reality… Fire Style… and die! Bomb Blast Dance! The Nine Tails' tail, huh? Huh? What the—?! Looks like you're having fun
over here… Obito. He's…Madara!

 Madara? You mean that Madara?

 Why? Why is that Madara
over here?

 Hey, Naruto!
Him being here must mean…

 What's happened to
everyone over there?!

 I'm not sure, but I suspect…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Obito and Madara"

 …that none of them
are doing too well.


 OBITO AND MADARA


 Tune in again!

 That's… He's… Madara…! It's just like you…to have defied
the Reanimation Jutsu. More importantly,
what's taking so long? Why? Why is that Madara over here? Madara? You mean that Madara? He's a Shadow Clone too… Where's the real one, Obito? Hey, Naruto! Him being here must mean… What's happened to
everyone over there? Brother… He's over there, eh? I asked you what happened?! I'm not sure, but I suspect… …that none of them are doing too well. Obito and Madara

 Summoning…Jutsu…! Lady Tsunade! Katsuyu… Do something for me… Yes! I'll fuse your body right away… No… My lower body can wait. First… Bring the other Kage…to me… I…can…still save them. Faster than the Curse Mark Chains
can wrap around! I'll return that to you.
It's yours to begin with. Finally, I can move! Thanks, Naruto! Now, it's my turn! Obito, did you launch
the plan haphazardly before you even took in
the Eight and Nine Tails? He knows about the plan… What's their relationship? You were hasty, Obito. Is that also why I was revived
in this form? Well, knowing you… I'm sure you have something in mind. What have you been up to
all this time? Where's Nagato? You were supposed to determine
the appropriate moment and bring me back to life
with Rinne Rebirth. That was the agreement. Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth. Nagato's Visual Prowess is the jutsu
that controls life and death. He is the seventh Pain. You tried to take advantage
of Nagato?! He betrayed us. He used the jutsu to revive
the Leaf villagers. I can't depend on any of you. Well, no matter…
It's still not too late. I'll capture the Eight and Nine Tails! Dead men shouldn't go around
messing things up! Huh?! It didn't explode?! Uchiha Reflection. I'll get the Eight and Nine Tails. Obito, you take down those two. Obito… What happened to you? Why would you join up with him? Am I…dead? Where am I? In between this life and the next…
young Uchiha. Those eyes! No way, Gramps…
You're an Uchiha too? Well, perhaps. He rescued me? But wait… You said we're between
this life and the next. Where are we? It's dark and I can't see so well. Anyways, who are you, Gramps? Heh, Don't tell me you're Death! The guy who escorts people
to heaven or hell… Nooo! I don't want to die yet! Help! I just saw a scythe or something! You're Death for sure! One especially for the Uchiha! Wait! I lived my life under a creed
of helping elderly people in need! Sure, I caused a lot of mischief
and broke a lot of rules…. But I'm sure my scale tips
on the positive side! Please don't take me to hell! Oww… The fact that you feel pain
means you're still alive. However, it's a miracle
that you survived. I'm amazed you weren't completely
crushed under those boulders. It's almost as if you passed
right through them. Where did you find me? In an underground passageway
I had created… collapsed next to crumbled rock. Still, half your body
had been crushed. I patched you up as best I could. So you saved me, Gramps. Thank you. It's too soon to thank me. I expect you to repay
your debt to me. After all, helping the elderly
is your motto, right? Well, yeah. So what do you want me to do? Help you with bathroom stuff? That would be good. Sorry, but I can't stay here forever! Now that I know I'm alive, I'm going back home to
the Hidden Leaf Village! There's a war going on. My Sharingan's finally
awakened… So now, I'll be able to protect
my comrades even better! Protect your comrades better, eh…? What is it? With that body…
your life as a shinobi is over. No, no, no! Finally… I finally got this eye! I'm confident my attack combinations
will be better now! I thought so. The scent has been
completely erased. We'll have to locate him by the slightest movement
and noise he makes. W-Where is he? Obito, behind you! Kakashi! My eye…! Hey, Kakashi! Are you all right?! Even if he's just a kid,
it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I'll take it nice and slow. Our enemy… He's good. He threw away the kunai knife
stained with the smell of my blood. Don't tell me you got dust
in your eye again? A ninja shouldn't cry… I'm not dead yet. If that was now… I wouldn't have let that
happen to Kakashi… Die! W-Why… There's no way you could see… Obito… You…! W-What is…that eye? This time…I'll protect my comrade! You're surprisingly stubborn. Hmm…. They're all so pathetic. The flow of Rin's chakra is disturbed… It's different from your chakra or mine. She's probably under a genjutsu… They didn't waste any time trying to
get the information out of her. We fought him earlier.
He's fast…  Stay alert! Right! And… At last, I'll be a shinobi
who can protect his comrades. Wake up to reality. Nothing ever goes as
planned in this world. The longer you live,
the more you realize that only pain, suffering,
and futility exist in this reality. What's with this old man…? Listen to me… In this world, wherever there is light, there are always shadows. As long as there is
a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish desire for peace
gives rise to war. And hatred is born in order
to protect love. These are all nexuses, causal relationships that
cannot be separated. Normally, that is. The old man's on a roll… Old people ramble forever
once they start. So…where are we anyway? Because you were hurt,
someone else was saved. Isn't that so? This is bad!
Run for the exit! Kakashi! Are you all right?
Rin…? Kakashi…? Obito! Don't… It's okay, Kakashi. I don't think I can make it… My right side is totally crushed. I can't even feel anything… Dammit! I'm giving you…my Sharingan. Whatever the village may say…
you are…a great jonin. That's how I really feel… So please accept it. Kakashi… Take care of Rin. Rin, hurry, take my hand! Rin! Obito! Just when Kakashi and I were…
starting to get along… I couldn't tell Rin that I…loved her… I wish…I could've spent more time…
with everyone. Shut up already! I don't want to stay here long! I have to… Leave if you really want to. If you can move, that is. Wait a minute… There's something weird
about this. What's an old man with the Sharingan
doing here all by himself? If I think about it, I know all the geezers and grannies
in the Hidden Leaf Village, and if I've never seen him around… It means this guy is currently
not a Leaf Shinobi. Which means… Gramps… I bet… you're a Rogue Ninja, aren't you? Just who are you?! I am…an Uchiha ghost. I am Madara Uchiha. M-Madara…?! By Madara… You mean Madara Uchiha,
as in my ancestor?! That Madara's supposed to
have died ages ago! What era are we talking about?! So you're more likely to
believe that I'm Death? I guess I am Death, in a sense… For this reality, truly is hell. I'm a cheater of death who
would be dead in no time… if I weren't continuously
siphoning chakra from that Gedo Statue behind me. I'm going home! I wouldn't bother.
There are no exits here. In any case, neither you
nor I can leave this place. At least, not with our bodies. If you move, the synthetic tissue
of Hashirama that I went to the trouble of
attaching to you will peel off. Do you want to die? There are a lot of things
I'd like you to do for me, for the rest of our lives. I went to great pains to save you. Don't rush to your death. What do you want? What does a geezer like you want
from a brat like me?! To sever the fate of this world. A world of only victors… a world of only peace…
a world of only love. I will create such a world. So what! Who cares! I just want to go back to everyone! I told you, things don't go
as planned. You will realize that in time. If you really want to die so badly,
then go ahead. But I'll be taking that Sharingan
of yours. Why do you want my eye?! You already have
your own Sharingan! Actually, my original eyes are
on loan to another. This one is a spare
I transplanted later. I'd like to have a few more in stock… Since I don't have a right eye yet. And only with two together can
the Sharingan's true power be unleashed. Then…that means… If I team up with Kakashi,
we'll both be even stronger. Then we'll be able to
protect Rin properly, together! I definitely can't stay here. Just you wait… Kakashi… Rin! I'm… alive! Hey, I was just outside and your friends Rin and Stupid Kakashi
are in a real pinch! What's going on?! They're by themselves, completely
surrounded by Hidden Mist Shinobi! Kakashi, you promised me!
Please protect Rin! I'll be right there! Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"I'm In Hell" Kakashi and I will protect Rin! I'M IN HELL Tune in again! I'm in Hell Hey there. How are you doing? Bad… What do you think? How long have I been here? It feels like it's been a while. Don't worry,
you don't need to pay rent. Those of us created from
the Gedo Statue don't have to eat either. No food bills,
no need for a bathroom. We don't even poo! Don't lump me in with you guys! I just have half of that weird stuff
stuck onto me. And thanks to that, you can survive
without eating or drinking. In fact, you should be grateful
and thank us. Good grief. We're the ones who don't want
to be lumped in with you! What you have is
emotionless synth-tissue. We are full artificial humans.
We have feelings and everything! You may have a better sense of humor,
but what we have is much better! Both our vocabulary skills and mental acuity
are far higher than yours! But we don't poo… Shut up! All right, explain how you're at
a higher level than I am! We are… The ones… – in charge of watching you!
– in charge of watching you! Don't talk in synch!
That pisses me off! We're only helping you
with your rehab because Madara ordered us
to get you up and running and usable by the time he wakes up. So he makes these noisy puppets
keep an eye on me… while he gets to sleep
the whole time? I swear I'm gonna get outta here
and return to Rin and Kakashi! Where's the exit? Can't be done…there's no exit. Madara sealed it off
with a huge boulder… after we lugged you here
on his orders. What?! He sealed us in?! By the way, you've been saying
"Rin-Rin-Rin" in your sleep a lot. Do you want to go outside to
collect a bell or something? Once in a while,
you said "stupid-stupid-stupid.” And "stupid Kakashi." Yeah, yeah, that's right!
Every so often. What's a "stupid Kakashi"? Beats me. Why don't you ask him? Was I really saying that? Um, may we ask you a question! What? When nature calls… In short, what does the urge
to poo feel like? For example… I thought you wanted to know
about stupid Kakashi! Why are you guys so obsessed
with poop? You don't have to get so angry. All right, we'll ask you about
Rin and stupid Kakashi later. Especially you, with the swirly face… You don't poop,
but you look like poop. I hate you! Anyway, where'd the other white guys go? They went outside to collect intel. What?! You guys can get out? We can all move through
the earth's surface. What the hell?! I'm locked up in here, and I have to hear about all
this weird stuff. So sorry to have bothered you
about poo! That's not what I meant! I mean, what Madara talked about! Something about severing fate
and all… Oh, that… Madara's not nice enough to talk
to a brat at his level. Simply put, he's talking
about discarding all the bad things in the real world and escaping inside a dream
that's full of good things! Inside a dream? Since it's a dream,
everything is how you want it! Even those who are dead
can be alive again! Yeah… Just think of it as all of us going
to this huge dream world that was created using genjutsu! Well, it's more like forcibly
taking everyone there… and for life too. With genjutsu? That's so beyond stupid,
I can't even understand it. If you have as much power as Madara,
anything is possible. It's just that he's weak right now
and can't do it yet. Much still needs to be prepared. Oh really? Well, I'm not interested. More importantly… I swear I'm gonna make it outside! And get back to Rin and Kakashi! What? I've got to get this body working again… Yaaaay! What?! Don't act tough and hide your wounds! I'm always watching, you know. It's starting to feel natural. Just a bit longer. I'll see you soon, Rin… Kakashi! I was just outside! Your friends, Rin and
stupid Kakashi, are in trouble! What happened?! They're alone and completely
surrounded by Hidden Mist Shinobi! You can't break through boulders
with that body yet. I have to save Rin and Kakashi… Why don't you wear my body? But you guys serve Madara.
Are you sure about this? He's…a good boy. Don't you want to help
Rin and Kakashi? Thanks, you guys! You kept the root tethered and
borrowed the statue's power eh? Nice. I'm pretty good, huh? All right! So you're going? I'm grateful that you saved me. But I'm leaving. I have to go. You're being too hasty… It may be premature to thank me. I'll probably never come back here. I've given my thanks. I'm going! You…will return. And that's when I'll get
your true gratitude. White one!
What's Rin and Kakashi's location?! Take me there right away! What you've got on your body
is like a clone of me. And we can talk telepathically to
each other over limited distances. Others of us are scattered
here and there underground. We're able to exchange intel. I'll use them to guide you. Swirly! First, we need to get outside. I'm counting on you. How are Rin and Kakashi
doing right now? According to the others,
it looks pretty bad. They're talking about some
Hidden Mist test subjects, but I don't really understand. Test subjects? Anyway, it seems Rin and Kakashi
are totally surrounded. And they're saying they all appear
to be jonin or Black Ops. What's Minato Sensei doing? Who is that? I'm asking you what the Yellow Flash
of the Leaf is doing! Seems he's on a different mission. At a time like this?! Kakashi… Look after Rin for me. I will. Kakashi! You made me a promise! Please… Please protect Rin somehow! I'll be right there! Obito, this will probably turn
into a battle. So I want to tell you
some things beforehand. What is it?! Your fighting ability is lower
than mine. Plus right now, it's like my big body
is wrapped around and protecting
your wounded little body. So what?! I think it would be better
if I do all the fighting. Remember what Madara said? That only with a pair together can the Sharingan's true power
be unleashed! Kakashi, the other half of my pair,
will be on the battlefield. Our combo attacks are superior! Kakashi and I will protect Rin! As I recall, you do have
Hashirama's tissue attached to you. A whole different strength may emerge when Senju and Uchiha powers
are combined together, but… What was that? I thought it was rain, but it's… I just got word from one of my guys. It seems… That's the location. Let's go! What's happening?! Stop showing these weird images! A little bit… Just a little bit farther! Kakashi… Damn it! He did it! After all the trouble
we went through to get her! Rin… Where… in the world… is this place?! Who is that guy? Reinforcements maybe? What a fool, jumping in alone! I won't accept it! I will not… What just happened?! Did he dodge them? …accept any of this! Do not mock the Blood Mist Village! Die! I can't hit him! Who is that guy?! He wields a strange jutsu! At least grab the girl! Don't hand her corpse over
to the enemy! There's no mistake!
This guy passes right through you! All of a sudden, he's able to use
the Wood Style Cutting Sprigs Jutsu… Obito, now I understand
why Madara chose you! What is he? I get it… I'm… I'm… in Hell. I shall sever the nexuses
of this world.

 That's why I came back.

 So you still felt loyalty to
your one-time teammate?

 No, it doesn't matter to me anymore

 whether he's alive or
dead in this world.

 Kakashi will exist
in the world we'll create. Rin too.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"World of Dreams"

 Teach me how to create
this world of dreams.
 

 WORLD OF DREAMS
 

 Tune in again!
 

 World of Dreams


 The longer you live… the more you realize
that only pain, suffering, and futility exist in this reality. Listen to me… In this world, wherever there is light,
there are always shadows. These are all nexuses, causal relationships
that cannot be separated. Normally, that is. He's talking about discarding all
the bad things in the real world and escaping inside a dream
that's full of good things! Since it's a dream,
everything is how you want it! Even those who are dead
can be alive again! A world of only victors…
a world of only peace… a world of only love. I will create such a world. Again, Rin… I'll create a world where
we can be together again. I shall sever the nexuses… of this world… That's why I've come back. I hope no one saw you. I'm the only one who saw him. Obito slaughtered everyone,
so we're safe. He didn't seem to want
to kill Kakashi though. But Kakashi didn't see anything. When reinforcements from
the Hidden Leaf arrived, he was screaming,
"Who killed the enemy?!" So you still felt loyalty to
your one-time teammate? No, it doesn't matter
to me anymore whether he's alive or
dead in this world. Kakashi will exist
in the world we'll create. Rin too… Madara, teach me how to create
this world of dreams. I don't need
your thanks anymore. Come here. Starting today,
you will be the savior. Look into my eye. You are inside my genjutsu. It's still a blank canvas, but I can project my will upon it
to create whatever I want. And even control them. Anything is possible, since I'm linked to, and borrowing,
the power of the Gedo Statue. Like this, see? We'll use this genjutsu
to create the ideal world. And then, we'll cast the genjutsu
on everyone and bring them here. The scale of this jutsu
is accomplished by using the moon instead
of our eyes. So that an entire world of dreams
is achieved. You make it sound so simple,
but I still don't quite get it. Let me explain, starting with the Sage of Six Paths
and Ten Tails. Isn't the Ten Tails just a legend? Legends are always derived
from something real. The Tailed Beasts
that roam the world… resulted when
the Sage of the Six Paths split up the power
of the Ten Tails. Do you have proof
that story is true?! I do. After I obtained the cells
of Hashirama Senju, I implanted them into my wound. At that time, nothing happened… It was only when I was starting
to die of old age… that my Rinnegan awakened. And it simultaneously led
to the undoing of a certain seal. I was then able to summon,
and extract, the husk of the Ten Tails
from a Seal Stone. The Ten Tail's husk? I call it the Gedo Statue. And the Seal Stone is
what we know as the moon. Immediately, I used the statue's body
as a catalyst to culture Hashirama's cells
into what you see before you. One could say that these artificial beings
are clones of Hashirama. Although they are reduced in quality. The Rinnegan cannot
be awakened without the possessing
both Uchiha and Senju powers. And the statue cannot
be controlled easily. You have Senju cells attached
to the right half of you. Even if you never awaken
the Rinnegan, you should be able to
eventually control the statue. Did you see them?
That redhead's eyes? So they're Madara's Rinnegan, huh… They're Madara's actual eyes. When that kid was younger… he secretly transplanted them
without anyone noticing! Nagato is of Senju bloodline. And the only other person
in addition to Madara who can summon the Gedo Statue. As Madara said,
first, we win him over and… Huh?! What're you gonna do? I'm going straight for him. H-Hey, shouldn't you plan
a strategy first? I don't need to do that. Obito… I shall teach you
the Uchiha Forbidden Jutsu, the Six Paths Jutsu. And the Shadow and Light Style Jutsu. I've implanted my will
inside this one… Think of him as being half of me. Though he'll be degraded too. You can use these beings
that I created using Shadow and Light
Style Jutsu as your soldiers. That Black Rod was created
as a physical manifestation of my will. Use it when you perform
the Six Paths Jutsu… Now, go on… Until the time when I will be revived… You shall be… Who are you? I am Madara Uchiha. Madara? You're either a criminal
or a total idiot to claim Uchiha Madara's name. Why'd you approach us? The Rinnegan… To guide those who awaken it,
is the mission our organization has been
entrusted with since ages past. You know about my eyes? You are the reincarnation
of the Sage of Six Paths, who dreamed of world peace
and stability. Only the villages of large nations
are showered in light. Leaving your small country's village
in the shadow, dying. That is why your eye
has awakened here. Wherever light strikes,
there are always shadows. So long as there is
a concept of victors… the vanquished will also similarly exist. The selfish intent of wanting
to preserve peace initiates wars. And hatred is born in order
to protect love. These are all nexuses, causal relationships
that cannot be separated. Normally, that is. But a world of just victors,
peace and love… such a world can be created too. If you allow us to collaborate,
you can learn how. As soon as you attain
the true power of the Rinnegan…. Your very own world can
be immediately actualized. Now… I can't do that. You're just trying to use us. Your offer sounds way
too convenient. One can only reach
the true world after knowing another's pain
and shedding tears alongside them. Shedding tears alongside them, huh? You mean in revenge? No, that's not what I meant. I meant in mutual understanding. Stop talking so idealistically. No such thing exists
in this world. Let's go, Konan… Nagato. We can't trust these guys! Don't you dare approach us again! I'll wait here at
the same time every day. You'll eventually realize it too. Who the hell are you?! The bodyguards of this village. This is a warning. Leave this village now! The hell with them…
Let's kill em! Water Style: Raging Waves! Wind Style: Gale Palm! Damn! We can't get near them! Die! Take one step and I'll skewer you! We won't let you take
a single step into this village! Give up now! Is it because of the rain?! Now's my chance! Sorry! Are you okay? Damn it! There's no end to this! I didn't want to use this, but… Do you belong to Hanzo's gang?! We're wearing his headband,
but we're not his subordinates. But some day, we want to bring peace to
the world just like Hanzo. In other words,
you're just his copycats. We're not copycats! We will keep peace
in this village! Not through violence,
but through negotiations! Are you crazy? This village lies between
two great nations! As long as they're at war
with each other, the fighting won't end! The strong will take everything
from the weak! That's how the world is! We're fighting to change
that way of thinking! Each one of you must
secretly wish for peace! Listen. One piece of straw is weak… But when you put three together,
it becomes much… Damn it!
I'm just trying to say, the more you have,
the stronger it is! Yahiko… You're so bad at
making speeches… Whatever! Look, we're not gonna kill you. Just get out of here! I won't guarantee that
we won't attack again! Fine. We'll do this dozens
of times until you give up… A hundred times, even. But just remember,
it'll be more painful the next time! Retreat! Earlier, when you tried to attack me,
you protected the kid. Thank you. We're war orphans too. You're such funny kids… You appear out of nowhere
and ask to protect this village. It's to change this land. War will never leave this land. Nothing will change. Yahiko… Seems like things are changing,
little by little. We're ninja who left the village because we didn't think
much of Hanzo's ways. But we were getting sick
of this lifestyle too. I looked into your eyes and began to feel like
starting over again… But I don't feel like
going back to Hanzo. So take us in as your lackeys! No! What?! But earlier, you…! Not as lackeys,
but as comrades. I'm Yahiko.
This is Nagato and Konan. I'm Kyusuke the Swift. If you need to gather intel,
you can leave it to these fast legs. Then go and find me other villages
that are suffering like this one. Yahiko… What? You should name our group. There are more of us now.
It's gonna be necessary soon. A name… How about…the Akatsuki. This nation weeps from
the sufferings of war. So we will change this nation… no, this world,
and welcome a new dawn! Akatsuki… That's a great name. Akatsuki! It's decided! – Yeah!
– Yeah! It's like…
the Akatsuki suddenly grew. They all bought into your dream. Actually, they're all tired of war. If everyone unites,
I know we can have peace. Say, where's Konan? She went out a while ago. Why? I dunno… This is… Konan's… "Dear Konan…" "From the first moment I saw you…" Is this…?! It's a love letter. "I've wanted to ask you
how you feel about me." "I'll be waiting anxiously
on the back terrace… Kyusuke." Don't tell me…
Konan's gone over there?! I dunno… Yahiko, didn't you have
something to do? Huh?! Oh yeah, yeah! I forgot.
I need to go to the john! I'm gonna wet myself! That guy! Running's not the only thing
he's fast at! More friends also means… more competition in love! No kidding… Hey, Nagato! Do you like Konan, Yahiko? Stupid! It's nothing like that! I think Konan likes you. Huh?! Oh, she's coming back. I know you're there… Yahiko, Nagato. Konan… What did you tell him? I told him that I don't have time
for a relationship until we make
the Akatsuki's dream come true. Isn't that right? Konan… Yahiko! Can you help me out with
some training? That jutsu…doesn't work… in the rain! Oiled paper… Great idea. I experimented. If you hesitate,
I'll leave you behind! Like I'd let you! Hanzo is setting an example
for us shinobi

 by fighting to bring peace
to this world.

 We will prove that the Akatsuki
will surpass him one day!

 I approve of an organization
that seeks

 to resolve issues
through pacifist means.

 It will help realize my dream

 of uniting the Five Nations
without force.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Creeping Shadow."

 So they are the apprentices
of that brat!

 CREEPING SHADOW


 Tune in again!


 Creeping Shadow


 Jiraiya Sensei… What is it, Kakashi? There's something I'd like to tell you. Is it urgent? I'm kind of busy now. There you go again,
sounding so dejected, Kakashi. No matter how difficult something is, when you make things seem
like such a drag, you make the people
around you uncomfortable. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Wait, wait. You're here now. Speak. But… I don't want to interrupt
when you have important business… SPECIAL SWIMSUIT EDITION

On second thought, there is nothing
more important than you. I know you. You haven't spoken to
anyone today, have you? You know… people should talk to others every day,
even if it's small talk. Otherwise, their hearts will grow
dark and serious. Talking to others builds bonds, and makes you feel grateful
that you're alive. That's the kind of creatures
we humans are. So, what happened? Well… It's regarding the three children from the Hidden Rain
you once taught, Jiraiya Sensei. Oh, you mean Yahiko, Nagato
and Konan? Yes. Recently, they have been trying to bring
about change in Hidden Rain Village. Or so I heard. Without using military might,
but through dialogue. Oh? NAGATO                    YAHIKO

 NAGATO    YAHIKO    KONAN
Those three, eh… I see. So they've started walking
on their own feet. How would you describe them? He's curious about strangers…
Now that's a good sign! Yahiko is passionate and
completely one-track minded. I want to become stronger! And then… And then,
I'm going to change the world! Konan is a girl who never
shows her emotions. But she was pretty and very talented. She must've grown into a beauty. As for Nagato… What happened? He… He's a remnant shinobi who told us
to hand over our food and valuables… But then Nagato… What is it, Nagato? Jiraiya Sensei… I'm… I'm scared of myself. What I did… Was it wrong? I really don’t know…
if it was right or wrong. But thanks to you,
Yahiko didn’t die. You protected your friend. That had to be the right thing to do. No one can blame you for that. When you are hurt,
you learn to hate. On the other hand, when you hurt someone,
you are resented. But you start to feel guilty as well. Understanding such pain
enables you to be kind to others… By understanding pain, humans grow. By knowing pain, thinking about it
and figuring out what to do. That is what growing up is all about. I just want to protect those two. No matter what kind of pain
I have to endure. I see. What are you always
thinking about, Sensei? There is so much war in this world. Only hatred exists. I want to do something about it. And to know what the answer
to true peace is… Jiraiya Sensei… Hmm? Oh… What's wrong? Nagato was a youth who could have been
the hero in my novels. The hero in your novel? As long as I'm alive,
there's a chance I'll see him… Kakashi… Hurry and become a man
who can be a hero in my novels. Brother, we have a lot of requests. I don't know if I can fulfill them all. We'll do them all. If there are people in need,
we'll save all of them. That's the purpose of the Akatsuki. At this rate, it would be great if we had
an organization as big as Hanzo's. Hanzo is setting an example
for us shinobi by fighting to bring peace to this world. We will prove that the Akatsuki
can surpass him one day! Akatsuki? Yes… I'm hearing rumors
here and there lately. Hmm… To think there are shinobi
like them in our village… I approve of an organization that seeks to
resolve issues through pacifistic means. It will help realize my dream of uniting
the Five Nations without force. But they sure made
a sudden appearance. Is there someone behind them? According to rumors, they're pupils of
Jiraiya of Hidden Leaf Village. Jiraiya? One of the Leaf's Sannin? Yes. After he fought you, Master Hanzo, Jiraiya stayed in this area for about three
years, teaching ninjutsu to war orphans. So they are the apprentices of that brat! The compassion to help people… Akatsuki could just be the repayment of
a favor that's finally come around. Say, Brother Yahiko… Seems villages along the border
are being attacked lately. What is that about? It's hard to tell for sure since they're in
out of the way places with little contact. But it seems the border
with the Land of Earth is pretty bad. That's the Seventh Ward… Shall we go and check, Nagato, Konan? Yes. Kyusuke, Daibutsu… Keep an eye on things in our absence. You got it. Leave it to us, Brother! How terrible… Who would do such a thing? This is far worse than anything
we've ever handled. Who's there?! Come out! Who are you guys? Akatsuki. Akatsuki? You seem to be shinobi
from the Hidden Rain. We are an organization working
to bring peace to this village. We heard this area was under attack,
so we came to investigate. Who did this? – What do we do?
– Can we trust them? The Hidden Stone. The Hidden Stone? No way! I heard that the Stone and
the Leaf are negotiating a cease-fire. How the hell should I know! Look at this village! The Hidden Stone ravaged
this entire area one after another! What do you plan to do
with such weapons? Fight! What else? We've already formed an alliance! Hold on! That will only cause
more casualties! Then what are we supposed to do? Are you telling us to sit here
and wait for our turn to die?! We'll go talk about this
with the Hidden Stone. What? If we acknowledge their pain too,
then we can speak honestly. They're sure to understand! Enough with your ideals! What about getting even
for our friends who were killed?! Only by understanding the pain of others
and shedding tears like them can we get close to the real world… Shedding tears with them? So you mean revenge? No, that's not what I meant. I meant understanding each other. Stop talking so idealistically. There's no such thing in this world. What's going on? If this goes on, the peace between
the Stone and Leaf will be shattered. Maybe the Hidden Stone aren't unified. Maybe the leaders are pursuing peace, but the shinobi under them
don't want it. It could also be the work
of Rogue Ninja. Whatever the case, we must settle this
quickly with the Hidden Stone! Scatter! What?! So many waiting to ambush us! Wait! You're Hidden Stone Shinobi, right? We are the Akatsuki,
shinobi from the Hidden Rain! We've come to talk! Damn! They refuse to talk! What do we do, Yahiko? Our goal is negotiation, at all cost! Do not kill them! This can't be real! Yahiko! Yahiko! Konan! Who's there?! Damn! The enemy?! Run now! Nagato, go! Nagato… Hurry… Get away… Run, Nagato! Run away! Hurry! Nagato! Stop, Nagato! Stop! Stop it, Nagato! Yahiko… We retreat for now! So that was the power
of the Rinnegan… Such a frightening power. What should we do? If the Akatsuki start moving, our other teams disguised as shinobi
from the other side will be in danger. For the future of the Hidden Leaf, peace must not exist
with the Hidden Stone. This strategy was precisely
to obstruct peace. Perhaps we can use that power. Collect all of the corpses here! Get rid of any traces of the Hidden Leaf! Sir! Danzo, huh… The Hidden Leaf is working
behind the scenes… Nagato… Yahiko… That jutsu that
Nagato used earlier… It's probably a jutsu he can perform
because he has the Rinnegan. That's… Yeah, I felt it. It was just like that time… That intense desire to kill made
my hairs stand on end… That power is not of this world. We must not let Nagato use it! If he does… I think it will kill him. Konan, where's Yahiko? He went to look for food. Oh… What's the matter? I'm scared…of my power. Nagato… Before, I had Jiraiya Sensei. I'm positive he taught me ninjutsu
so that I could control this power. But Jiraiya Sensei is no longer here… Yes, Jiraiya Sensei is gone… But… You have us. We'll control your power. For as long as it takes… Konan… Be careful, Yahiko. You don't need to see me off! See to Nagato's wound, will you? From now on,
save your worrying for him. Nagato is the keystone of the Akatsuki! He's the one who will change
this nation…this world. The same can be said of you… Everyone respects and admires you. Nagato is no different. Nagato is going to be
the bridge to peace. My role is to be a pillar
that supports that bridge. Yahiko… This nation continues to weep. It continues to endure pain. I used to hate this land that
cries all the time. But now, I want to save it. It's what I want with all my heart. It reminds me of the crybaby
that I used to be and I can't ignore it. Yahiko! Be careful. He is the bridge to peace.… His will itself is the bridge. Nagato… We believe in Yahiko! Let's go, everyone! Right! What made this happen? It was too late when we found them. We were on the way to a peace conference
with the Land of Earth… We recognized them
as members of your clan, and… Lord Danzo, did you see the perpetrators? No doubt it was the Akatsuki. Akatsuki?! But the Akatsuki is… A group that expounds peace and has been growing in influence
lately in this village. Yes, I hear they are an organization
that shares my will! So why…? Hanzo, you left them on their own too long. What? It's fine to be idealistic. However, therein lies your weakness. My weakness? Because of your high ideals, you are blind to those
with similar motives. But they became the enemy
and turned against you. That is what caused this tragedy. However noble your ideals,
not everyone will buy into them. They may act like
they share your hopes, but they're just a disorderly mob. Ultimately, they'll be obsessed
by greed and power turn into a cast of evil across the land. Cast off the sheep's clothing
from the Akatsuki and you'll find they're just wolves
out to take over the village too. Lord Hanzo… If nothing is done,
they will take over this village. Danzo of the Hidden Leaf, huh? An interesting person
has started taking action. Just like Obito said,
the clouds are moving strangely. There is no such thing as peace
in this world. That is the reality. Reality is like this grand river
that flows here. No matter how hard one tries to stop it, reality will swallow you up whole
and mercilessly crush you. There is only way to escape that suffering. That is the Infinite Tsukuyomi,
Project Tsuki no Me! Nagato, reality is
moving ahead quickly.

 Coordinate your actions with me.

 What Yahiko talks about
are just ideals.

 No matter what you say,
I believe in Yahiko's ideals!

 Even though you possess the Rinnegan,
you still think like an average person.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The New Akatsuki"


 Very well…
Go see reality for yourself!


 THE NEW AKATSUKI


 Tune in again!


 The New Akatsuki


 Everyone is growing weary
of fighting. Yes… Even if we win, the Akatsuki doesn't receive
any rewards… The only things we have
are our ideals. In time, pent-up weariness
will erase that ideal. Are you saying that everyone will
soon forget what they're fighting for? Nagato… Will you become the leader
of the Akatsuki? Huh? I'm not…cut out to be a leader. That day… I killed someone for the first time. The feeling of that moment
hasn't left these hands. And I can't stop trembling! Yahiko… But you're different. You have the mark of a hero… A special symbol known
as the Rinnegan… that will become
everyone's new ideal. Yahiko! Are you going to take advantage
of my Rinnegan? I'm scared of myself. I've suffered so long because
of these eyes. I know… But you have someone who can
keep that power in check for you. Konan will always be at your side. Yahiko… Hey, Brother! Big news! What's going on? A messenger from Hanzo is here. Are you Yahiko,
the leader of the Akatsuki? Yes, I am. I am Kanzo, a trusted friend
of Hanzo of the Salamander. I've heard many rumors
about you Akatsuki… How you seek peace without
relying on military weapons. That is the Akatsuki's founding principle. Hanzo asked me to deliver
a confidential letter to you. Please… Is he serious? He would like to
meet you personally. Hanzo has given the Akatsuki
his seal of approval. In time… Hanzo will leave you to handle
the peace negotiations between the three nations
that surround the Hidden Rain. Handle the negotiations
between the three nations…? That's amazing, Brother! Please relay to Lord Hanzo
that I accept. That means we can help people
out in the open! So many gave their lives
for us to get to this point. Finally, we'll be able to
face them with pride. Yahiko, your determination to free others
from pain reached Hanzo. Look… The Akatsuki's ideals
have been restored. There was never a need
for a symbol. We'll all follow your dream,
no matter where that leads us. Nagato… We weren't wrong! Nagato and I will go to
the meeting tomorrow with Lord Hanzo. Are you sure, Brother?
We'll all go with you… No, that's not necessary. Lord Hanzo will be shocked if
too many of us show up. I know, but… By the way, where's Konan? She went to patrol
the Seventh Ward. She won't be back until
tomorrow morning. I see… On such a special day too. Anyway… Today, the Akatsuki took
a giant step forward! Everyone! Set aside your duties
for today and celebrate! The Akatsuki brats aren't suspicious
at all, are they? Of course not. If the one called Yahiko is killed,
the Akatsuki will naturally die off. And what of your plans? No need to worry. Who could have…? This is…! We should be securing
the hostage right about now. With this, that lawless gang that
threatens the village will disappear, and the Hidden Rain will be yours. We finally made it up to this point. Nagato. You're—! Reality is moving ahead quickly. Cut your ties with Yahiko immediately
and join me. Otherwise, you will all… We will what? What Yahiko speaks of
are just ideals. He tries to understand others' pain… but they do not even attempt
to know our pain. Furthermore, this world has
no desire for that either. That is reality. You possess the Rinnegan,
so you should understand. No matter what you say, I believe in Yahiko's ideals! I guess without pain…
you cannot experience reality. In that respect, even though
you possess the Rinnegan, you still think like
an average person. Very well… Go see reality for yourself,
and experience pain. There you are, Nagato. Yahiko… Was someone just here? No… Let's get going. Or we'll be late for the meeting
with Lord Hanzo. Right, let's go! Oww! What's the big idea?
I was having a nice nap! What? Hey! Where'd Brothers Yahiko
and Nagato go?! I think they left already. The meeting with Hanzo is today. Wake the guys up!
We have to catch up with them! What's wrong? I'll tell you later! What's going on anyway? We just received word from a member of
the Hidden Leaf border team. The Leaf's ANBU Black Ops are
on their way to Hanzo's as well. The Leaf's ANBU? Why are they going to Hanzo's? I don't know the specifics. But I just don't like the timing
of it all, you know? And when you think about it… this thing with Hanzo just sounds
too good to be true. Then that means...
today's meeting with Hanzo is… Whatever it is,
we need to let Brothers know! As much as I regret it,
I can't let you go any further. Who are you?! My name is Madara Uchiha… Damn you! Did Hanzo send you? I don't work for Hanzo. But I can't let you interfere right now. I want Nagato to see
what reality is. We don't have time for
your nonsense. Kill them! You take care of the weaklings. You sure like to order me around! I'm Kyusuke the Swift!
Don't underestimate my speed! I slipped right through him? What's going on?! Kyusuke! You bastards! Why…are you…doing this? I'm going to awaken Nagato's Rinnegan
in the truest sense possible. What're you talking about? There is no such thing as peace
in this accursed world. Nagato must abandon this dream
and set out into a new world. I'm not going to let you! Daibutsu! Now! Go right through me! Hurry! I'll see you in the next world! The Water Prison Jutsu? You can't beat me with a jutsu like this! This is no ordinary Water Prison. This is cement! For the first time in
my dismal life as a war orphan… I found hope in the Akatsuki! You think…I'd let some bastard
like you take that away?! He's sacrificing his life
in this attack… But, as expected,
we're literally in different dimensions. No way! Kyusuke… Your death will not be… Owww… The outer skin hardened… and peeled off, and it stings! Sorry, but this is the end for all of you. Are you okay? Yeah. Come, we have to hurry! We have to witness Nagato's destiny! Yahiko… You are the leader,
so you must die. If you resist, this woman will die. You! The red-haired one. Use that to kill Yahiko. Then I will spare you and the woman. Don't, Nagato! Never mind me!
Both of you escape! Nagato. Kill me. Nagato! No! Hurry it up. Or do you want this woman to die?! Konan… Yahi— You and Konan…must survive,
no matter what it takes. You are… the savior…of this world. I know…you can… do it. Yahiko! Kill them! He repelled it! How?! Did we get him? Nagato… Konan, hold onto Yahiko
and stay still. Not bad, kid! You escaped even while being hit
by my Fire Style Jutsu! You're…no ordinary kid. Those eyes… Get him! Summoning Jutsu! Gedo Statue! There it is! So he summoned it.
It's the Ten Tails' husk… What…is that?! Nagato... No! Don't use that! We're dead if that touches us! So you were the leader
behind the scenes. It's quite a surprise that
you possess the Rinnegan. Nagato… Teleportation Jutsu! Nagato, Yahiko, Konan… The world of dreams… I shall let you see each other there… without fail. Didn't I say so? Yeah, I finally understand. The selfish desire to
preserve peace causes war. Hatred is born from wanting
to protect love. There's no such thing as peace
in this accursed world. Exactly. You will always be the leader
of the Akatsuki… Yahiko. Hey, Kakashi!

 What's all the fuss?

 They're about to announce
the Fourth Hokage!

 Don't be surprised!

 The Fourth Hokage is going to
be Minato Sensei!

 Rin, it seems like Minato Sensei
is going to be Hokage!

 If he's the Hokage,
I'm sure Sensei will…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Mask That Hides the Heart"


 …prevent any more victims like you guys…

 A MASK THAT HIDES THE HEART


 Tune in again!


 Kakashi… It won't wash off! Kakashi: Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops
A Mask that Hides the Heart


 Accept this from the Hokage! Deliver it to Lord Tsuchikage and relay to him that we desire
an immediate response! There's no need to deliver
anything to him. We'll give you your answer
right here! Sometimes it's best not
to be so hasty. What?! The Fourth Kazekage? Why is the Hidden Sand here? This is Hidden Sand territory. It would be unwise to have
an incident occur here. We'll put out any sparks
that rain down over us. The Sand will move accordingly,
as the Sand. Remember that,
whatever you decide to do. Scatter! What about the request to enter into
the peace treaty? Naturally, it will be turned down. Whatever the Hidden Leaf negotiates
with the Hidden Sand, nothing will challenge
the unity of the Stone. – Right!
– Exactly! Silence! Naturally, I am proud of
the unity of the Stone. However… With the pride on our line,
we sent 1000 of our shinobi. And I hear that it took just one of them,
the Yellow Flash, to stop the invasion. And that's the reality of it. I hear they're going to enter
into a peace treaty with the Hidden Stone. How much faith can we put
in a single piece of paper? That's for sure. You guys, think about
the burden on Lord Third! In any case, the long, great war
will be over for now. Let's toast with some dumplings! Hey, Kakashi! Want to join us for some dumplings? He's not too sociable these days. Is something bothering him? Well, you can't expect him
to be jumping for joy. Are you talking about
Obito and Rin? Yeah. That would definitely leave
a hole in your heart… Kakashi… Rin… HOW A SHINOBI SHOULD DIE Well done! We can breathe
a sigh of relief for a while. Are you satisfied with
an agreement like this? To forgive
the Hidden Stone's actions and drop our demands
for compensation… It's as though we lost the war! What do you think, Hiruzen? Continuing the war
any further would be disastrous for the already
exhausted Hidden Leaf. It's a step toward finding
common ground… Many of my friends gave
their lives for this great war! It's like they died in vain! And I assume full responsibility
for that. How will you take responsibility? I intend to step down as the Third Hokage,
and have the Fourth Hokage installed. How regrettable… The Third Hokage was
doing a fine job… Hmm… Truth be told, the Third Hokage
was too soft… and he allowed the village
to be pushed into a corner. We need a Hokage
who will change things, and enforce the laws of the shinobi. We need someone like that. And? Is there such a person? I recommend Orochimaru,
one of the Legendary Sannin. – Oh…
– Him? What do you think, Lord Third? Orochimaru is truly a genius
in this age of war. However… A sinister will and greed lurk
deep behind those eyes. Such a person cannot be given
the duties of a Hokage. Lord Third! I recommend Minato Namikaze. A pupil of Jiraiya… In other words,
a disciple of your disciple. A man so skilled,
he's nicknamed the Yellow Flash. Oh! Minato is still too young. He emerged victorious
at the Battle of Kannabi Bridge, and distinguished himself by leading the way to end
of the Third Great Shinobi War. I am opposed! What about the rest of you? I believe that you will carry on
the Will of Fire. So I want to entrust you with
the future of the Hidden Leaf… and the shinobi world. You will accept, won't you? I shall do my best to deserve
your trust, Lord Third. I wish I could have passed this on
under better circumstances… What lies ahead is not peaceful. I'm prepared for it. Good. I know you can do it. What are you doing there? What did Lord Third want with you? Well… Did you get scolded? So what?
Don't worry about it, ya know! Well, it wasn't that… Then what? Well… He wants me to be
the Fourth Hokage. Oh really?
Don't mind the Hokage— What?! What did you just say? I've been named the Fourth Hokage. Congratulations, ya know! Hey, hey… Thank you very much for
all your hard work. Thank you. It's all going Hiruzen's way. The Third Hokage intends to
use Minato as a puppet and keep ruling the Hidden Leaf. At this rate, the Hidden Leaf
has no future. Don't give up yet. If my research is successful, it will be easy to grasp
the power of the Hidden Leaf. To grasp power…
stronger measures must be prepared. When the time comes,
we won't be choosing measures. But, it's not time yet. Generally, if he's popular at all,
he should… Let's go, Kinoe, Kinoto, Hinoe! – Sir!
– Sir! I, HIRUZEN SARUTOBI, HEREBY ANNOUNCE
MY RESIGNATION AS HOKAGE, AND APPOINT
MINATO NAMIKAZE AS THE FOURTH HOKAGE.
SIGNED, THIRD HOKAGE HIRUZEN SARUTOBI What's going on?! Hey, Kakashi! "How a Shinobi Should Die"?! What is this? Give it back. What's going on? Oh yeah! The Fourth Hokage
was just announced! Don't be shocked! Minato Sensei will be
the Fourth Hokage! RIN NOHARA Rin… It seems like Minato Sensei
is going to be Hokage! Minato Sensei will be
the Professor's successor and change the Hidden Leaf…
and the shinobi world. There won't be any more sacrifices
like you guys… I'm counting on you…
Fourth Hokage. I shall dedicate my life to it. Kakashi. You shouldn't use 
that jutsu anymore.  From what I could see, your focused concentrated attack
undoubtedly has power and speed… But it makes you move too fast  to be able to ascertain 
your opponent's counterattack. It's still an imperfect jutsu.  Those were Minato Sensei's words
back then… Obito… I'm giving you…my Sharingan. Whatever the village may say…
you are…a great jonin. That's how I really feel…
So please accept it. You gave me this Sharingan
in my left eye… When Chidori and Sharingan became one, 
it became a complete jutsu. But…that jutsu took Rin's life.  Chidori! So this is where you've been! You have a mission.
You've been summoned immediately. Enter. There's a mission? Yes, I want you to retrieve the documents
relating to the peace treaty. Yes. There are still some shinobi
who desire war. And there are rumors that they are trying
to steal the documents to create discord. Please do your best on this mission. Yes, sir. I'll wrap this up!  Chidori! Kakashi… Kakashi… Kakashi… Kakashi! Die! Severe Leaf Hurricanes! Another one? This isn't like you!
Why are you spaced out? S-Sorry… Kakashi? Get a hold of yourself! I see… Yes… I've never seen Kakashi like that. I'm glad I secretly sent you. To help him at a time like this…
That's what an eternal rival is for! That's what I believe, but… You've already done a lot. Will you leave the rest to me? HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Minato Sensei! I mean…Lord Fourth… Address me as you always have. Some in the village think I'm not qualified
for the position and oppose me. I came here today… to assign you to the ANBU
under my direct control. Why me? I want you to be my right-hand man… AN HOW A SHINOBI SHOULD DIE EQUIPMENT DEPT. Here's a set of gear for you. Thank you. I want you to leave your current mission
and take on a special mission.

 Was there an issue? 

 It's nothing like that.
This is confidential, but... 

 Kushina's pregnant!

 Congratulations!

 Thank you. That's why…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Minato's Death."

 …I want you to be Kushina's bodyguard.


 MINATO'S DEATH

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,130
That was fast... I heard it was a matter of urgency... I want you to take Kakashi's place. It's an honor to be able to work
in Kakashi Senpai's stead... This isn't an Anbu Black Ops mission. It will be a regular mission. Therefore, take off that mask
and I will give you a codename. During this mission,
you'll be known as "Yamato." I understand. An additional member... a new recruit
from the Anbu Black Ops Training Division will be dispatched to Team Kakashi. From...The Foundation? However... What is it? Keep a close watch
on his actions. Naruto, do you know him? Yeah... He's the guy who
attacked me earlier when I was with Shikamaru
and the others! Stop it, Naruto! Come to think of it, who're you, mister? Oh...could it be...? I'm the replacement captain
for this team while Kakashi is in the hospital. Call me Yamato. Captain...Yamato... You're comrades on the same team,
so you guys need to get along. C-Comrade...? This guy? Sorry about before. Since we're going to be
teammates from now on, I just wanted to find out
how strong you were. You didn't have to go through
the trouble of doing that... But thanks to that, I now know you're a worthless guy
with questionable "equipment." Hey, what did you say?! - We're going to be teammates!
- Damn you! - Don't start fighting right at the start!
- Some things are inexcusable! But you're kind of a rotten guy,
aren't you...? Is that so? People won't like you if
you say stuff like that. I like nice...ugly women like you. Ugly... Hey, what did you say?! - Try repeating that, you twerp.
- Hey, do you remember... - Don't try being cocky with me, cha!
- ...what you just said to Naruto?! Oh, don't you look silly. Master Jiraiya. Well, I guess you always
looked like that... I heard you'll be in bed... HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL



for a week, huh? Well, it seems so... Hey, don't force yourself. It doesn't look like
you'll be able to move for awhile... It's a get-well gift. Both volumes of the deluxe edition
of "Make-Out Paradise." You may have already read
it several times, but it should at least help
pass the time. Thanks... Surely this isn't the only reason
why you returned to the village. I'll give you the details once he...
and Tsunade get here... He? Who's that? I think he's calling himself Yamato
on this mission... <i>An Unnecessary Addition


</i> At any rate, the four of us
will be starting our mission now. And yet... What's up with this? I don't have time to put you all in
a cage to get used to each other. Come on, introduce yourselves. Naruto Uzumaki. I'm Sakura Haruno. My name's Sai. Well, that's enough getting
acquainted for now. I will now explain our mission
as Team Kakashi. The four of us will now head
for the Tenchi Bridge... capture the Akatsuki spy who
has infiltrated Orochimaru's organization... and bring him back here. It's an opportunity for us
to get information on Orochimaru and Sasuke Uchiha. We will obtain a precious source
of information with which we can draw up plans
for both the assassination of Orochimaru and the retrieval of Sasuke. Be sure to proceed with caution! Right! Yes, sir! We'll meet at the main gate
in an hour! We'll leave once you've equipped
yourselves with your Ninja tools! For crying out loud! I don't like that Sai jerk at all! Why's he taking the place of Sasuke? Team Kakashi's fine with
three people! He does indeed have a foul mouth... but don't you think he kind
of resembles Sasuke? Like his face and the way he talks... He doesn't resemble Sasuke at all! Sasuke's cooler...
No, not cooler. Well, he's better! Yeah. Sasuke's a little cooler
than Sai, isn't he? Not just a little!
Sasuke's totally b-better! Good move. Listen carefully...
Never let your guard down. What is it... Senpai? Listen carefully. The classified mission
you've been given is Lord Danzo's... A cat, huh...? Anyway, Lord Danzo's vision... for the future of the village rests
upon this classified mission. Failure is not an option. I know. Good. You're still carrying that
around with you...? This is... In The Foundation, ...you have
no name and no emotions. You have no past...
and no future. There is only the mission... Never forget the will of
The Foundation, which supports the giant tree known
as the Leaf Village from underground... unseen. I won't. Hidden Leaf Hospital Sorry to keep you waiting! You're late. I got held up with this and that... Very well... Kakashi's waiting. <i>Make-out Paradise
<i>Deluxe Edition</i> It looks like they're here... We're coming in, Kakashi. Please come in. It's been a long time, Senpai! You... I see. So you're the one
called Yamato, huh? I get it... Yes! As of today,
I will be known as Yamato while I work as the substitute captain
of Team Kakashi. Yamato, huh? I brought him here... because there's something
I'd really like him to know since he'll be working as
the captain of Team Kakashi. And that is... the biggest reason why he was chosen
as Kakashi's replacement. Is this about Naruto? Exactly. You know that Naruto has
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit... sealed inside him, right? Yes, I do... Sometimes the Nine-Tailed Chakra
leaks out from inside Naruto's body... and takes the form of the Fox Spirit. We call it
the "Nine-Tail's Cloak." The Nine-Tail's Cloak, huh...? Does it happen often? It happened on
our previous mission. When his emotions intensified, the Nine-Tailed Chakra started
to leak out... it engulfed his body and
became the Nine-Tail's Cloak. Just before the second tail formed... I somehow managed to suppress
the Chakra with the tag I received
from Master Jiraiya... But who knows what
would've happened if things had been left as they were... I see...
So it appeared just as I thought... Judging from the shape
of the Chakra, the number of tails will
probably continue to grow... and eventually... there will be nine. That's about the size of it... Master Jiraiya,
how many tails have you seen...? I've come close to dying twice
in my lifetime... The first time, I broke six ribs
and both arms, and several of
my internal organs ruptured... It was when I was trying to peek
into the women's bath at a hot spring... and you pounded me good, Tsunade. The other time was... during Naruto's training when I saw the fourth tail
of the Nine-Tailed Chakra. I'm off! Master! Oh... What is it? You should still have some time
left before you're to assemble. I wanted to have a few words
before we leave. I see. Then your timing is perfect. There's something
I wanted to ask you. What is it? It's about Sai. I see... So it's already going badly, huh...? Yes... It can't be helped... For the time being,
you keep Naruto under control. I'll do what I can, but... Come in! <i>Who's that?</i> Danzo, huh...? What is it? Did you place
a skilled Anbu Black Ops member as the captain of Sai's unit,
Princess Tsunade? I selected the best man I have. He's worked since
the Third Hokage's tenure. Very well... But I just hope... he hasn't been tainted by
the teachings of the Third Hokage. The teachings of the gutless
Third Hokage who disliked matters of conflict... Just like how the teachings
of your grandfather... tainted the Third Hokage... I guess I'm more or less relieved. Now I can enjoy my meals
without worries. Excuse me. Who the heck...was that? A long time ago... he competed with
the late Sarutobi Sensei over the position of the Third Hokage. Unlike the Third Hokage, he's the leader of a hard-line
military faction based on rigid logic... and is Sai's superior. He hates me because
I'm the granddaughter of the First Hokage as well as a student of
the Third Hokage who was a moderate. Umm... Isn't it about time...? Oh! That's right.
Isn't it almost time, Sakura? Yes, it is... I'll be going now. Right! <i>If we succeed in this mission,
<i>we can get one step closer to Sasuke...</i> All right! I'm off! Okay... Team Kakashi,
will now set out. How long are you guys going
to argue? If this keeps up, it will surely affect the way
we carry out our mission. So here's a suggestion from me. In order to build rapport as a team, I can toss you guys into
this cell for a full day, or we can stay at a hot spring inn for
a night. Which would you guys prefer? I prefer the kind and gentle approach... but I'm not against using fear to
control you guys either when necessary. Next Time: "The Fake Smile" Minato's Death

 Many shinobi from small villages
that survived by taking advantage
of the turbulent situation, have no wish to be controlled by
the nations of Fire, Wind and Earth. There's no doubt they will continue
to cause disruptions. But we must maintain peace, which was attained through
the sacrifice of many. I'm counting on all of you. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! PRACTICE FIELD THREE Chidori! Huh? Five shinobi,
all approaching rapidly! What does their headband show? The Hidden Stone. We have a peace treaty
with them, don't we? Maybe they have urgent business? What?! Why are you breaking the treaty?! We're the Leaf Village! You must be making a mistake! Reinforcements! Withdraw! Thanks for saving us!
The Hidden Stone betrayed us! This isn't a Hidden Stone shuriken. So they were fakes? But why? They want to cause a rift between
the Stone and the Leaf. H-Hey! Don't chase them too far! Chidori! Hey! How have you been? Are you ignoring me?! It's only been a short while since
Kakashi transferred into the ANBU, but some of his actions
are quite astonishing. One… Four! Sharingan! You're Cold-blooded Kakashi
that everyone talks about! Wait, Kakashi! Help me! Five! All five were killed with a single blow
to their vital points. If you kept at least one alive,
we could've gotten intel… Lord Hokage, regarding the issue
that you were concerned about… We have not seen any evidence of
psychological trauma in Kakashi associated with taking Rin's life. Is something on your mind? No… HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Congratulations. What? Your due date is…let's see… October 10. Oh then, yeah! Huh? A baby…? I'm going to be a mother, ya know! And I'm going be a father… A mother, ya know! I'm going to be a father! A mother, ya know! Imagine that,
I'm going to be a father! A mother, ya know! Kakashi, I want you to leave
your current mission and take on a special mission. Was there an issue? It's nothing like that. It's more like a top-secret errand. Kushina's pregnant! Oh… Congratulations. Thank you. But when a female Jinchuriki
becomes pregnant, the energy that keeps the seal
in place transfers to the fetus, weakening the Tailed Beast seal. And so…it will be roughly
ten months until she gives birth. I want you to guard Kushina
against any incidents. Yes, sir! Thank you for protecting Kushina. But… It's standard for the ANBU
directly under Lord Third to take over the guard
during the birthing period. Then I'll be returning to
my duties in ANBU. There's no need to be so hasty. Why don't you take
a break for a while? RIN NOHARA I'm sorry I haven't been by. It's not that I've forgotten… I've been…sworn to secrecy… but Minato Sensei is going
to be a father. This generation won't know war. If only we were born a little later… RIN NOHARA I should tell Obito too. So I'll be going, Rin. Thank you! Thanks, I'll come again. Hey! Watch where you're walking. Why don't we just do
Rock-Paper-Scissors again tonight? Not that again!
Think of something more exciting! How can you call yourself my rival?! We have an early start tomorrow. So let's pass for tonight. Don't use a mission
as an excuse! I have all this hot pent-up
energy inside me! Now is the time for
diligent training! Honest-to-goodness discipline
and hard work lead to success in future missions! Are you listening to me?! You've gotten awfully cold
since joining the ANBU. I've heard the gossip.
They're calling you cold-blooded. Well, I know that
I'm not supposed to talk about your being in the ANBU. Still, that's no reason to forget
about our friendship! Youth is short! Say, Guy… Do you sense anything weird? There's been a chill in the air… It's your attitude that's causing it! There's nothing like
the present for youth! What is this…feeling? There, there… It's a strange feeling. Of all times for
Mom and Dad to be out… Don't cry, Sasuke. No matter what happens, your big brother will
definitely protect you… It can't be… Summoning Jutsu! That's…! N-No way… The Nine Tails! – Run! Help!
– It's the Nine Tails! Go, Nine Tails! Lord Third! The Nine Tails is…! The Nine Tails has suddenly
appeared in the village! Damn you, Nine Tails! This is the moment I release
my fiery pent-up power! Don't be hasty, Guy! Come on! I'll be your opponent! Wait! Huh? Gather immediately in the guardroom! Why? It's the Third Hokage's orders! Lord Hiruzen? You heard him. Let's go, Guy! BIND Now listen up. You young shinobi are to
stay away from Nine Tails. What do you mean by that? This is not a battle between villages… This is a domestic issue. There is no reason for you
all to risk your lives. Speak for yourself! Calm down, Kurenai! You're a shinobi too. We are not guaranteed
to live a long life. But, my daughter,
you are a woman. At least, pass on the Will of Fire
to my grandchild. Make that your oath to your father…. For I do believe in you. This is no time for a family argument! I can't take not being able to do
anything at a time like this! The barrier has disappeared! Lord Fourth! Lady Kushina! Take her to Leaf Hospital immediately! Summon the Medical Ninja! Lord Third… Kushina…! Please take care… of the child. Of course, you don't need to worry. His name is… Naruto… Minato and I… picked it from… Jiraiya Sensei's novel… Naruto, you say?
Fine. I take full responsibility. So, for the child's sake,
you must rest! Kushina! I promise… Minato… Kushina… You both gave your lives… to protect the Hidden Leaf Village…
and its future. Minato Sensei… We repelled the Nine Tails, but the sacrifice was much too great. This is no time to lament.
The Hokage's seat is empty. We must decide on someone quickly. Perhaps someone from
the age group below Minato? We have nurtured fine jonin, but they all lack the experience
to rule over a village. Is there anyone else? Well… It cannot be helped.
This is a critical time. I shall take over. Oh, will you do that? If you are willing… You stepped down once…
Are you up to the task? Truth be told, even though
you went after the Nine Tails, you failed to save the Fourth Hokage… That remark is uncalled for. And where were you
at that time, Danzo? Just indulge this old man. Let me fill in as Hokage until
we can groom the next one. Kakashi Hatake, correct? Lord Danzo… Come and work under me.
What do you say? But…I was Minato Sensei's… Lord Fourth, the one
who recruited you into the ANBU is no longer with us. If you stay where you are,
you will end up working directly under the Third
who will reassume his position. It was his foolhardy ideals of peace
that dragged the war on and drove Obito and Rin
to their deaths. But… Furthermore, on the night
of the Nine Tails' rampage, you were not able to join the fight
because of Lord Third's orders… Isn't that why Lord Fourth
lost his life? I don't want to believe that
he planned this to return to power… but the future of the Hidden Leaf
cannot be entrusted to someone like him. A few ANBU will be selected to guard the Feudal Lord's procession
back to his prefecture. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! This is the plan. Wood Style?! Wood Style! Giant Forest Jutsu! Halt! I called him. Yes, sir! Thank you for coming. Here… The time has come. Good work, Kakashi. The First Hokage who founded
the Village Hidden in the Leaves,

 Hashirama Senju, could freely
use Wood Style Ninjutsu.

 He was the only one who could. 

 But there's another who can
use the Wood Style. 

 What's going on? 

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hashirama's Cells"

 How is he able to use
the Wood Style?

 HASHIRAMA'S CELLS

 Tune in again!

 I don't want to believe that
he planned this so he could return to power… Kakashi… Kakashi… Kakashi! Hashirama's Cells


 So he's back to ignoring me again. Welcome! Wood Style! Giant Forest Jutsu! Who is that boy
who uses the Wood Style? Maybe I'll find some information there. HASHIRAMA CHRONICLES FIRE STYLE Found it. Hashirama Senju… The leader of
the Senju Clan of the Forest, brought peace and stability to
this bloody, war-torn world. He and he alone mastered
the Wood Style Ninjutsu… He and he alone mastered
the Wood Style Ninjutsu… No, there's one more. What does this mean? How is he able to use
the Wood Style? TOP SECRET Top secret? Where are the contents? Is this what you are looking for? Professor! It's all right. I give you permission. Read it. Yes, sir! Long ago, the First Hokage,
Lord Hashirama… after a death match with Madara… used the Wood Style to
suppress the Nine Tails. After that, there was no one to
take over the Wood Style Jutsu… Either the Sharingan or
Wood Style are necessary to suppress the Tailed Beasts. In the Hidden Leaf Village, there was a time when
they researched and tried to revive
the First's Wood Style Jutsu. However… despite the dedicated
efforts of many… the tests to transplant Lord Hashirama's
cells failed one after another… and the lives that were sacrificed
continued to grow. And so…
unfortunately, that jutsu… was deemed a Forbidden Jutsu
and sealed away. But recently, genin and chunin, and even members of the ANBU
have gone missing. Furthermore, what's more disturbing
are incidents where newborn infants
have been kidnapped from hamlets surrounding
the Hidden Leaf Village. Infants?! Of those confirmed,
there have been 60 kidnappings. Who could have…?! What I'm about to tell you is hearsay… Someone is continuing
the experiments and trying to implant the cells
of Lord Hashirama. Even if they're rumors,
why would anyone…? There are those who want to obtain
every jutsu that exists. Even I have wondered sometimes, if there were only someone
who knows the Wood Style… Had that been the case, the Fourth Hokage need not
have sacrificed his life. Isn't that why Lord Fourth lost his life? Mind you, this is just hearsay. If… If Lord Hashirama's cells had
really been implanted into infants… Implanting cells into infants
is forbidden… And even if someone was doing so, the possibility of it succeeding
would be very low. However… If…just if…the first infant who
was kidnapped survived… He or she would be
ten years old already. Ten years old… Are you all here? Yes, sir! Tomorrow morning at
the hour of the tiger, the Third Hokage and five ANBU
under his direct command will depart for
the Feudal Lord's prefecture. His purpose is to reassume
the Hokage post left empty by Lord Fourth's demise. If we allow this, the Hidden Leaf Village will once again
be forced to accept a weak and indecisive leader. For the sake of the village,
we must prevent this at all cost. Hence, your mission is… somewhere along the route… take the life of the Lord Third
quickly and discreetly. Remember, no one must know of this. It must appear that it was
the work of itinerant shinobi. Understood? – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! Lord Third, are you ready? Yes, let's depart! Enemy attack! Wood Style Jutsu! What?! A Substitution?! Wood Style! Giant Forest Jutsu! Chidori! You… Where did you learn the Wood Style? I didn't expect an answer anyway… Leave. Go quickly! That jutsu of yours will be critical for
the Hidden Leaf Village one day. They were only
after Lord Third. It seems their purpose was
to separate us from Lord Third. They scattered off somewhere. Were you all right here? Yes… Did you recognize the enemy? I don't know who it was. Well, that's all right. I'm sure Lord Third will take care
of the rest. I regret to inform you… that I won't be giving up
that seat just yet… It seems like you want to ask me
why I'm still alive… It's nothing like that! I understood that
you left this morning for the Feudal Lord's prefecture. A certain fellow betrayed me… Rather, he came back to me…
and warned us that we would be targeted
on the way to the prefecture. I can easily investigate and
find out who is behind this… And that person will be executed. That is as clear as day… But it's against my principles
to cause any more death. If I could meet that person,
I would tell him… That I will overlook his actions
this time… But in exchange,
he must do all that is in his power… for the sake of Hidden Leaf Village. You and your ideals of peace… One day, that naiveté will be
the death of you, Hiruzen. Hmm…perhaps you're right. We've always been this way. You are the light and
I am the darkness. Wherever there is light,
there is darkness. But losing either one causes
disruptions in the world. Professor… I'm unqualified to be in the ANBU. Why? Thanks to you, I'm still alive. Still, I nearly betrayed you once. I couldn't protect the Fourth Hokage… I can't blame you if
you hate me for that. Actually, when Minato was alive,
he came to speak to me about you. I wanted him to forget the pain
in his heart, even just a little… That's why I assigned him
to the ANBU. But from the rumors I hear lately… I think I might have made
the pain go even deeper. Right now, I regret it. No one can heal a wounded heart… Only time can heal all wounds. Yes… Well, there is one solution. Why don't you assign him
to guard Kushina? If he leaves his duties with ANBU
to watch over a woman who is about to
give birth to a new life, perhaps it will trigger
a change in him. You're right! When Minato died… I considered releasing you
from the ANBU, for a moment. But I am in need your strength
at this time. Yes, sir! Will you continue on as an ANBU
who reports directly to me? Yes! I hope that Minato will
forgive me as well… Lord Third…
There's something I need to tell you. Hmm? There's someone in the Foundation
who uses the Wood Style… Just as I thought… I have an idea who it is.
Let me handle this. Yes, sir. I see… So you will be filling
the post again, Lord Third! You have the knowledge
and experience already… I am very relieved. Is that man not here today? The fierce-looking one
with that scary eye… Do you mean Danzo? Oh yes, he's the one. He had an urgent matter to attend to,
so he is absent today. Oh…I see. I don't feel very comfortable
around him. We must cease direct contact
between us for the time being. Did something happen? Kakashi betrayed me, and there's a possibility
that Hiruzen knows about us. That's not good. In time, he might even learn
about this place and its secrets. Well, we're dealing with Lord Third.
He'll be on to us eventually. No… He probably has already guessed. Kakashi… It won't wash off… Lord Third is reassuming
the title of Hokage… I thought the changing of
the guard would mean a new era… I know what you mean, Genma… It's not going to be easy
for Lord Third, you know! Especially at his age! We just have to do our best
for the village, that's all. Let's celebrate the return of
Lord Third with some dumplings! – Yeah!
– Yeah! I-It's me! It's me, Kakashi! You were seriously out
to get me just now! I thought I was going to get killed! I should say the same.
What the hell were you thinking? I was just… I just wanted to lure you into
continuing our rivalry showdowns. Sorry… The current emergency
summons is in place

 in order to promptly
recapture Orochimaru,

 who has slipped through our grasp.

 The knowledge that Orochimaru holds is
a valuable asset to the Leaf.

 If he leaves the Land of Fire,
it will be a fatal blow to the Leaf!

 When that time comes…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Rogue Ninja Orochimaru"

 You… I like the look in your eye.


 THE ROGUE NINJA OROCHIMARU


 Tune in again!


 The Rogue Ninja Orochimaru


 Is that you, Kinoto? Lord Danzo,
there's an urgent matter… Hiruzen himself is leading them? Damn him, he's gone too far. Kinoe, are you here? Are you going to kill me? Are you up to the task…
Sarutobi Sensei? And even with that… No…it's because of that. Hiruzen will not be able to
kill his student Orochimaru. Sarutobi, you have to—! Just for times like this, we have
another secret meeting place. Kinoe, go on ahead
and wait for Orochimaru. Lightning Blade! You… I like the look in your eye. However…I don't need a fake. So cute… Do you want to see his blood too? Lord Third… So you set this up. Don't move! So that's Orochimaru… This emergency summons was called
regarding the capture of Orochimaru who escaped during
the previous mission. According to intel reports,
Orochimaru is seriously wounded. Considering his condition, he will not be able to leave
the Land of Fire easily. Listen carefully. The knowledge, data and jutsu
that Orochimaru possesses are a valuable asset
to the Hidden Leaf. If possible, bring him back alive. If he leaves the Land of Fire… …it will be a fatal blow
to the Leaf! And so… This must be settled before
he crosses the nation's borders. Everyone, do your best. Scatter! You must love your pupil very much. It's hard to believe that you
of all people would fail… I will be happy to cooperate. For the sake of the Hidden Leaf,
I shall do everything I can. Thank you. I'd appreciate that… Against those eyes, I… Next time…I won't fail. Summoning Jutsu! What's wrong, Kakashi? I want you to follow a scent…
It's Orochimaru. Snakes are difficult,
they don't sweat. But leave it to me! Who are you?
How do you know of this place? Lord Danzo sent me! I'm here on urgent business
regarding Lord Orochimaru! This is the message
from Lord Danzo. No mistake… This is Lord Danzo's seal. What? Lord Orochimaru has…the Leaf? This isn't a transformation! His flesh was smoke?! Give me the details. I am Gotta of the Iburi Clan. Oh… I'm… Well…I'm Kinoe Tenzo! Yukimi! Welcome home! Tenzo! If unforeseen circumstances befell
Lord Danzo or Lord Orochimaru, it was previously agreed upon that
they would come here for help. Then Lord Orochimaru
will come here? Most likely… Lord Orochimaru… The pursuit by the ANBU
is under control. I will take Lord Orochimaru
out of the country without fail. Lord Orochimaru gave us life. We would do anything for him. Everyone, get ready to
welcome Lord Orochimaru! Come with me, Tenzo! What? Umm… I'm… Stand here for a moment! Huh? See! It's the same! Ever since then… I've measured your height! I see, but… Yukimi, enough. He isn't Tenzo… He is too! U-Um… Who is Tenzo? Yukimi's younger brother… He's no longer here. We put him in Lord Orochimaru's
care three years ago. In his care…three years ago? Then this scratch is… Even though we were apart,
I saw what you looked like. You've returned from
Lord Orochimaru's! I'm sorry… Yukimi. Show him around. Yes. This is our clan's graveyard. This forest is… Instead of using stone headstones,
we plant trees. They say the soul finds refuge
in the tree and protects us. The soul… Yes… The souls of the dead… Our ability to transform
our flesh was incomplete. We didn't have total control
over the smoke… Sometimes, we would just
turn into smoke without notice… Sometimes, the smoke would just dissipate without
turning back into flesh… Members of our clan
never lived long. You didn't see many elders,
did you? No… So many died… That's why we planted many trees. So many…died? But Lord Orochimaru found us. This symbol known as the Curse Mark
stabilized our ability. But the Curse Mark
wasn't perfect either… He said much more research
was necessary… That's why Tenzo was
sent to Lord Orochimaru as a research subject. Research subject… The younger you are, the greater
our power manifests itself. That's why he wanted
a young test subject. But…that left
only you as the child. It wasn't like he was going to die… That's what Lord Orochimaru said. Even if I were to be called up, I'd be able to see everyone,
including Tenzo. See…everyone. Everyone… What is it?! What's wrong? This is… What happened?! That's strange… Who planted these… Those children are… Tenzo is still… What… We don't need this one… Or this one! Or this one! – Let's go…
– Huh? It seems I'm about to
reach my limit. Just a little bit more… What is this? Did you see how the roots twisted
around the ceiling and walls? The inside is a maze of
hollow caves like this… It gets a little tight from here… But we can still pass through. Where are we going? Tenzo and I had a secret base! There…
You can hear it clearly, right? That crevice connects
to the outside. We used to come here often
to listen to that sound. And we'd talk about
the outside world. Why don't you go out yourself? Because there's wind. Wind? If we turn into smoke
while we're outside… and there's wind blowing
at the same time, we'd be dispersed. So we're limited to places
like caves where there's no wind. More than anything, we loved coming here to
listen to the sounds outside. We'd try to guess
what the sound was… What was going on outside… Tenzo and I used to
imagine all the time. What's wrong?! It's serious. Someone has
come down into our village. Is it Lord Orochimaru? We haven't been able to
confirm that yet. If it's Lord Orochimaru,
we will welcome him. If it's someone from the Leaf
in pursuit, we will get rid of him! Everyone, hide and get ready! Is it true?
Are you really going outside

 Yes, it's true!

 But if you go outside…

 Aren't you afraid of the wind?

 I just really want to see where
these sounds come from, with Tenzo!

 What?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Orochimaru's Test Subject


 The two of us, together.


 OROCHIMARU'S TEST SUBJECT


 Tune in again!


 Orochimaru's Test Subject


 Someone has come down
into our village. Is it Lord Orochimaru? We haven't been able
to confirm that yet. If it's Lord Orochimaru,
we will welcome him. If it's someone from
the Leaf in pursuit, we will get rid of him! Where am I? I've wandered into a strange place… What's he doing here? Did he follow me? This is indeed a secret hideout... Luckily, I found tracks… Did I stumble upon something good? Is this mist? No, it's not… This isn't an ordinary diversion… Well then… I'm going to find out who you are! That mask… You're Leaf ANBU! You got me! Who are you? What are you doing here?! What is…that jutsu…? Enough, I'll do it… Body Oxidation Jutsu. I will oxidize the inside of your body. Your chakra, blood, organs,
nerves, and muscles… everything at will. Now… How's this? Kakashi…Hatake… I know what your aim is. However, you will not lay
a hand on Lord Orochimaru. Before you can...
we will get rid of you! Wood Style! No! You cannot let him die! Why? He's an agent of the Leaf! I can get useful information about
breaking through the border. Who cares?! We will kill anyone
who threatens Lord Orochimaru. Then I'll take both of you down… You're brave! But know this. If you're wrong… That will happen to you as well. Wood Style…! He's…the Foundation… Looks like you're awake. I'm going to ask you
some questions now. Where are we? Why are you here? I'm the one asking the questions. Wood Style! How did you find out about this place? I found it by chance…
Of all the luck. I'm sure you Leaf will do
just fine on your own... How much does the Leaf know
about Lord Orochimaru? Fine, I'm very patient.
In time, you'll talk… I'm sorry. That was our only option. You… Lord Danzo's orders. I am to wait here
for Lord Orochimaru… I knew it… You intend to allow Orochimaru
to get away. Well, we're both after
the same thing. Lord Danzo is only thinking
about the Leaf. The thing to fear most is Lord Orochimaru leaving
the village borders. He sent me to stop him. I wonder about that… Orochimaru is seriously wounded. If he can't move,
obtaining intel is useless. He may not even make it here… Perhaps that's especially why
obtaining intel is important. By the way, are those guys
connected to Orochimaru? Who are they? The Iburi Clan… A clan that has the ability to transform
their bodies into smoke. Orochimaru discovered them… and it seems like he performed
experiments on them. Experiments… What I'm about to tell you
is hearsay… Someone is continuing experiments to implant the cells
Lord Hashirama. Transformation into smoke… If I have to fight them again,
that jutsu will be a nuisance… When it entered my body,
I lost every ounce of my will… Is that so? Ultimately, Danzo is
of the Hidden Leaf. Right now, Orochimaru is just
another enemy. Isn't that so…Kinoe?! Bastard… Since the beginning you were—! There are too many here
to take on… We are with Lord Orochimaru… You both…will die for
Lord Orochimaru's sake…! Tenzo… For Lord Orochimaru's sake…die… Tenzo! I won't let you…touch Tenzo! Tenzo? Are you still going on about that…? I know! I know! Tenzo is already dead, right? I've had it! I won't let him die! Tenzo! Yukimi… Are you betraying… Lord Orochimaru?! This way. What is going on? This way, Tenzo. What does this path connect to? It goes outside! You're going to free us from Orochimaru? I don't know. …Kinoe! Y-Yes… Hey, are you really taking us outside? Yes! But if you go outside… Aren't you afraid of the wind? There's something I really want to see. Oh! What happened? Can you hear it? Huh? Listen carefully…
It's faint, but you can hear it. Oh! I can hear it! I just really want to see where
these sounds come from... with you, Tenzo… Huh? Damn it! And I get left behind here? This is not fair!
Please get out of my body. No! Until we reach that sound, you and I will be together,
just the two of us. It feels so good! Right now, I feel like
the two of us can do anything! The two of us… I'm finally out! I thought climbing straight up
would do it, but… Damn it. I've had nothing
but bad luck today. Who's there? Where is Yukimi? Don't have a clue. Defying me again? Have you forgotten
the pain from earlier? If it's smoke, then I'll do this! You're mine! Too easy! Then this! I can hear the sound!
Isn't it exciting, Tenzo?! Yes, well… All right then… It looks good here. Now stay still. Okay! It's all right now. Let's go! It's here… So this is where it was. Isn't it amazing?
And there are so many people! I can smell something.
I wonder what it is, Tenzo! My, my! She's so loud! What?! How rude! What do you think you're doing? You've ruined our merchandise! How's this, Tenzo? It...looks good on you. YOU COULD BE THE CHAMP!
HOT DOG-EATING CONTEST The only way to defeat him is
through a surprise attack! Damn it! It's over! So talk! Where is Yukimi?! That was a clone, but how does it feel to
kill your own clone? Yukimi… The only one who can help
Lord Orochimaru… is you… What are you talking about, hey?! How was it? Did you have fun? Yup… But now that I've seen it myself… it wasn't as great as I expected… What do you mean? The actual festival was
completely different from what I had imagined… If I had come alone,
I may not have known what to do. But I was with you today,
Tenzo, so it was fun! You're right… There were two of us… I was a test subject too. Huh?! My body was poked
and prodded, and observed. It was painful,
and I could hardly bear it. Many of my friends died. When you're alone,
all you think about is dying. But when there are two of you…
all you think about is surviving. Shall we go somewhere…together? You must be joking. Let's go back to your village, together. You must return to
your village immediately. Let's go. Just a minute, Kakashi. Did something happen? Kinoe! This girl is crucial in order
to capture Orochimaru. Orochimaru will go to
the village because she exists. We're of no use… We have to offer Lord Orochimaru
young Yukimi's blood… To lure him… This is a mission… My mission is…
as you suspected, Kakashi… It is to allow Orochimaru to get away. What?! Kinoe! I am Tenzo! Don't mess around! Tenzo, what's wrong? What happened? Lord Orochimaru...

 Inferior things are useless, after all...

 Yes... It has to be your blood!

 Only with the blood of the young will
this ability manifest itself…

 That's… But you were going to help
guide us to the next generation…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Their Own Paths"

 Yukimi! THEIR OWN PATHS


 Tune in again!


 Their Own Paths


 Wood Style! What?! Stop! This girl is crucial in order
to capture Orochimaru! Why? Gotta said so before he died… He died? No! Run! But… Please come with me!
We'll escape together! Kinoe… That's as far as you go! Yukimi! Yukimi! Kinoe! Do you realize what you're doing? Stop, Kinoe! Will you break the rules
like Orochimaru and betray the village?! Just for that girl? Why? Why does it have to be her? It seems that transfusing the blood
of someone with that ability enables you to use the jutsu
to become smoke for a short while. If that were true, it would make it
very easy to slip across the border. However… Yukimi… The only one who can
help Lord Orochimaru… is you… What are you talking about, hey?! We're of no use… We have to offer Lord Orochimaru
young Yukimi's blood… He said that and died. That's so…! Gotta! Lord Orochimaru helped us survive. But that doesn't mean
we live for his sake. Tenzo! You have to bear it, Yukimi. We do not live for the present. We live for the next generation who
will be able to bathe in the sunlight and feel the wind and laugh
without a care in the world. We live for that day. That's why Lord Orochimaru's research
is so important… Tenzo! Yukimi… Are you betraying
Lord Orochimaru? Without Lord Orochimaru,
our clan has no future. That's why Tenzo and Gotta gave up
their lives for the sake of the clan… Orochimaru will definitely
go to that village… looking for that girl. She's gone? Could she have heard us? Do you think she returned
to the village? For Orochimaru? If Yukimi's blood is taken with
her body being unstable as it is… She's prepared to die… All I wanted to do…was protect her. This time… If that's the case,
you didn't break the rules. Huh? Let's go protect that girl… Tenzo! Yes! Where is…everyone? Perfect timing! Orochimaru is up ahead,
heading this way. Damn it! Let's go! Lord Orochimaru! Disgusting… Inferior things are useless, after all. Yes, it has to be your blood. E-Everyone! This happened because you weren't here. What you see are the results
of my tests on the Iburi Clan's bodily
transformation ability… Only with the blood of the young,
will this ability manifest itself… I've gathered all the other samples… Only your blood remains…
and that will be the end of it. That's… But you were going to
help guide us to the next generation… No… No! You can't say no.
I'm going to have your blood. Don't waste my time! Why? You intend to wrap me in smoke? The prey can never defy the hunter. Yukimi! Tenzo! So you've come to take her back? Too bad… Damn it, Orochimaru! He's losing blood.
He can't go far in his condition. He's bound to stop somewhere
in order to take Yukimi's blood. We'll split up and search! Right! Leave it to me! This is… No way… Are they guiding us? You noticed it too? Over there! On the other side! Lightning Blade! Yukimi! Orochimaru! You brats! How dare you! How dare you! I won't waver this time… I'll look into your eyes
up to the very end and bring you down! You are still so inferior. Know your place! Didn't I already tell you?
Grow up a little more. Then I'll fight you! Orochimaru! Yukimi! Yukimi! This is…Orochimaru's Curse Mark! Kakashi, what do we do? Only the jutsu caster can
release a Curse Mark. But that's…! Ten…zo… Ten…zo… Ten… Wood Style! Yukimi! I didn't encounter Orochimaru. Nor did I encounter a strange clan… Nor someone from the Foundation. I'm not scared of
the wind blowing anymore. I'm going to walk straight ahead,
for my future. I can only live by the rules. But that's okay. I know now that I'm capable
of protecting someone. It's been a while, Kakashi.

 They know how to fight
against the Sharingan.

 You planned on doing this
from the very start!

 Why do you want to kill me?

 Because it's a mission.

 Stop it, Kinoe!
Abandon this mission!

 To a shinobi, a mission is absolute!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Targeted Sharingan"

 I'm going to complete the mission!


 THE TARGETED SHARINGAN


 Tune in again!


 The Targeted Sharingan


 The Sharingan is a disposable power. Even the Uchiha Clan
who possess the Sharingan… The more they use that power,
the greater the loss of their eyesight… until they finally go blind. Furthermore, there is even
a Forbidden Jutsu that is invoked at the cost
of losing the Sharingan. Get me a replacement for
this right eye of mine. If we are to attack
a member of the Uchiha, careful preparation is necessary. There is one
who is not an Uchiha… who has neither parents nor teachers,
who has killed his own comrade… Kakashi…Hatake. Then we won't need to worry
about any future trouble. RIN NOHARA Whose grave is it? The friend he killed. Kakashi Senpai… Lord Hokage is calling. All right. Stop calling me "Senpai."
This isn't the academy. You're still my senior in the ANBU. Besides, you're my role model. Find someone more suitable. Hey… RIN NOHARA


Rin Nohara… You are aware that Orochimaru
has secret research facilities scattered throughout the country,
aren't you? Yes. After he deserted the village, he destroyed some and
kept some intact. Including ones that
we have no knowledge of. It seems that way. A small battalion on a mission came
upon such a facility by accident. According to their report
upon their return, it seems to be a research facility
that was abandoned by Orochimaru. Did they go inside and investigate? Fortunately, not yet. Right, since we don't know
what's inside. I do not want members
of our village to learn about his repulsive
research activities… of what happened to
their missing kin and friends. However, an investigation is necessary. So, you want me to go? It's been three years since
Orochimaru left the village. But he still remains
a thorn in our side. I hate to ask you,
but please take care of this. Yes, sir. I understand Orochimaru's hideout
was found. It's one of his research facilities. I've dispatched someone
to investigate. I see… Is something troubling you? He could have set some kind
of trap before abandoning it. Are you sure it's safe
to investigate? I sent an experienced and
qualified ANBU agent. I hope nothing goes amiss. SEAL SEAL Is that you, Kinoe?! It's been awhile, Kakashi. What are you doing here? I'm on a mission. As my back-up? No, that isn't it. Did Lord Danzo dispatch
a Foundation shinobi, because he's interested in
Orochimaru's research facility? Foundation shinobi never discuss
their mission… Is that it? No matter.
You did help me out there. We can't have you burned
to a crisp. Do you want to investigate
what's inside together? Whatever we find,
we'll share the intel with each other. What's wrong? We may work in different divisions,
but we're Leaf shinobi. Let's cooperate. Yes… Who knows if a demon or
a snake will appear? Let's go together. Right. The only trap seems to have been
that one by the entrance. Orochimaru was pressed
for time in his rush to escape. You're right.
Still, we must be careful. Yeah… Let's go. Right. There's nothing in here. What was Orochimaru
experimenting on in here? Probably doing what
he does best. Experimenting on
human test subjects... Human test subjects… This one's no good. This one as well. That one too… They're all no good… This human experiment is a failure. I thought that an adolescent
would adjust far better in propagating Hashirama's cells, but… But it's just the opposite. A child doesn't have the strength
or stamina to endure it. I guess I'll have to
shut this place down. Wait! But not to worry. There are many more ways
of cell implantation. I'll start the next test right away. Wait, wait… Wait! Ki…noe. Hey, Kinoe. Let's go. Right. This one's locked. Leave it to me. It's open. That jutsu went extinct in
the Hidden Leaf Village ages ago. So how did you learn it? It's a secret. Are you aware that
the Wood Style jutsu is extremely important to
the Hidden Leaf? I didn't know that. The Jinchuriki of the Nine Tails
belongs to the Hidden Leaf. The Wood Style Jutsu is
one of the powers that can control the Nine Tails. I know that the Sharingan
is the other power. Your Wood Style Jutsu isn't just
for the Foundation… It is a power meant to serve
all of Hidden Leaf Village. Lord Danzo wants to
keep you at his side. But you are more suited
to working directly under the Hokage. Don't you want to leave
the Foundation and come out of the shadows? No…no… I'm still alive! N-No… There's a survivor?! What is this? There's something's inside. What's going on, Kinoe?! Kinoe! Are you serious?! Yes, I'm serious! I have the advantage.
All that's left is… He knows how to fight
against my Sharingan. This was his intent
from the very beginning… Kinoe! If you're serious about killing me,
then I won't hold back! It will be a death match,
friend against friend! I'm serious. I'm dead serious! Why do you want to kill me? It's my mission. What kind of mission sends
a friend after a friend?! You're one to talk. You're the one who killed a friend. A substitute?! Wood Style Substitute… You've gotten better
since the last time… Yes. So don't hold back, Kakashi. I won't kill a friend! No need to hold back! Stop, Kinoe! Abandon this mission! A shinobi's mission is absolute! Kinoe! A mission is not absolute! If your orders are to kill a friend… that order is wrong! The one who gave you
such an order is wrong. Is Lord Danzo wrong? Can you walk? What's the matter? You don't seem to remember
who you are… but have you forgotten
how to talk as well? Uh, no… Follow me. Orochimaru is greedy. It's good to have the desire
to test out new things, but he gives up too quickly. However, you're lucky
he gave up on you. If you had stayed
with Orochimaru, you would have ended up
another test subject. My organization takes in shinobi
who have nowhere to go. From now on, you will be
a shinobi of the Foundation. The Foundation? Yes. We are the tenacious Foundation. We support the great tree known
as the Village Hidden in the Leaves. Without strong roots,
a large tree cannot grow. That's why the Foundation… You will be called Kinoe. Henceforth, you are one of us. You were one of 60. Huh? In order to produce a Wood Style user,
59 other children have been lost… Kinoe, cherish your life. Yes. I'm leaving. He said I'm going to be one of
the Foundation of the Hidden Leaf. Water Style! You're able to infuse chakra
quite nicely now. Yes! All right. I shall train you myself. Lord Danzo is? Directly? Personally? I once saw the First Hokage
in battle. Deep Forest Emergence...
Deep Forest Bloom… Such formidable
Wood Style Ninjutsu. If you have inherited his cells,
I put all my hopes in you… Manipulate the Earth Style
and Water Style Change in Chakra Nature
simultaneously! Not quite yet. I'm sorry. It can't be helped. You are not an exact copy
of the First Hokage. Here is the Ninjutsu Scroll left
by the First Hokage. It's full of jutsu that I can't use, but you should be able
to learn them. Me? Learn jutsu that you cannot,
Lord Danzo? The world of the shinobi is filled
with a myriad of jutsu. You cannot compete
with just one power. We must master various jutsu and use those powers
to unite the shinobi world. I have high hopes
for your Wood Style Jutsu. Lord Danzo is not wrong! I will fulfill my mission! Why you…! To hell with your mission! I'll say it again! Killing a friend is not a mission! Then why did you kill her?! What?! Why did you kill Rin Nohara?! Why did you kill her?
Why did you kill her?! You killed her because
it was your mission! Don't speak about Rin! As part of my ANBU missions, I've had to deal with Rogue Ninja
and traitors of the Hidden Leaf. So I can't help it if
I'm called Friend-Killer Kakashi… But… Rin was… Why you…! I didn't want to kill her! I couldn't protect my friend. That's why Rin died… from this Chidori… Couldn't protect her…? Couldn't protect her… Are you going to…kill me? Are you a friend
of the Hidden Leaf? Or are you a traitor? I'm not a traitor. Then what are you? I am…Kinoe of the Foundation. Then Kinoe…renounce your duty
to the Foundation. I cannot. Then I'll take you into custody
and turn you over to Lord Hokage. Do whatever…you please. The Foundation is a unique
organization that supports

 the large tree known as the Leaf,
from deep underground.

 Shinobi of the Foundation
have no names.

 No emotion. No past.
No future.

 We only have our missions.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Shinobi of the Leaf."

 A mission for the Foundation
is absolute, Kinoe...

 A SHINOBI OF THE LEAF


 Tune in again!


 A Shinobi of the Leaf
 

 Stand up! We're leaving. What about the mission, Kakashi? Our mission is to search this location. It's suspended, because of you. Don't let me stop you. You're trying to kill me,
so stop joking around. I'm not joking around. Move! I hear Foundation agents
are all trained to discard their emotions. Does the same go for you? Not just our emotions. Shinobi of the Foundation
have no names, no past, no future. We have only our missions. Well, you failed your mission. Don't move! Snakes? What are they? That one too! They're not ordinary snakes! They're Orochimaru's experiments. What?! Kinoe! Kinoe! Dead. Everyone's dead. I'm going to die too…
In here, like this… I don't want to… Are you alive? Are you all right, Kinoe?! Are you all right? I think so… But why? Why what? Why did you save me? I couldn't just let you die. But even if you did,
I would have deserved it. Did you…want to die? No, I didn't. I…did not want to die. Then be thankful that you're alive. That…I'm alive? The fluid from the snake… This is… Don't inhale! It's poisonous! Run! R-Right! Kakashi! I didn't encounter Orochimaru. Nor did I encounter a strange clan… Nor someone from the Foundation. I can only live by the rules. But that's okay. I know now that I'm capable
of protecting someone. Get me a replacement for
this right eye of mine. Kinoe, where's Kakashi? You did it? Yes. So you didn't need me. Where's his body? I made it appear like he was killed
by Orochimaru's trap. Lord Hokage's ANBU
will probably find him. Good. Let's return before
they get wind of us. Kinoe? To Kakashi… I've become confused
about this mission, where I'm supposed to kill a friend. So I'm going to abandon
this mission, and I will report to Lord Danzo
that I failed. Please take care. Kinoe…! Kakashi Senpai, we have to
tend to your wounds. I must report in first! Hmm? What's the matter? Lord Third… Regarding the Foundation's
Wood Style user… He targeted me. Lord Danzo ordered it. But he dropped his mission midway
and saved my life. He then returned to the village. But who knows what's happened
to him by now. W-What is the meaning of this, Kinoe! I beg your pardon.
I failed my mission. If Kakashi beat you, then it's my fault
for underestimating Kakashi's strength. However, you abandoned
your mission and did a poor job of faking his death,
and then returned here… And I sent two men to do the job! What was your intention? Answer me.
Why did you do this? Please go to Lord Danzo
and save Kinoe. Lord Third! It's agreed upon that
I don't interfere with the Foundation. However, that is not possible
in this case. Yugao. Sir! Take this missive
to Foundation headquarters. It's an order from the Hokage. Summon Danzo here immediately. Yes, sir! I'm counting on you, Yugao. Please rest assured, my lord. Kakashi… Sir. Go to the infirmary and
tend to your wounds. Yes, sir. Senpai?! I'm coming with you. Kakashi is a shinobi of the Leaf. He is a Leaf comrade.
Is it right to kill a friend? Consider only those in
the Foundation your friends. Isn't the Foundation
a friend of the Hidden Leaf? The Foundation is
a unique organization that supports the large tree known as the Leaf,
from deep underground. Just as a tree is divided into what is above
and below ground, the Foundation has its own existence. Kinoto… What is a Foundation shinobi? Shinobi of the Foundation
have no names. No emotion. No past. No future. We have only our missions. As the leader of the Foundation,
my missions are absolute! No future… No past… No emotion? No name? Welcome back, Tenzo! Are you listening, Kinoe?! No! My name is not Kinoe! What are you saying? You are Kinoe of the Foundation. What other name could you have
besides that temporary one? I am a shinobi of the Leaf! Not just of the Foundation! A shinobi of the Hidden Leaf,
which has a trunk and branches! Everyone is my comrade! Damn you… What made you turn on us?! Take him to the treatment room. Bind him with a Curse Mark. Sir! Lord Third has summoned Lord Danzo. Notify him that he is
to appear immediately. SUMMON

Lord Danzo is not here. What? We will let him know
as soon as he returns. Where is he now? We do not know. We aren't privy to Lord Danzo's schedule. Go back and report this to Lord Third. What about you? I'll stay here and wait for him. Go. Right. Stop! You are under Foundation jurisdiction! Where is Kinoe? Damn Kinoe… What crazy thoughts did
Kakashi put in his head? Lord Danzo, we're ready. Release! Let's get out of here! Kakashi?! Kinoe! Wood Style! Hey, wait! Found him! Over there! Wind Style: Vacuum Bullets! Wood Style: Domed Wall! How good of you to come over
from your side, Kakashi. You entered Foundation jurisdiction
without authorization and tried to take one of our own. Don't think you'll get off so easily. Lord Danzo, Kakashi is… Silence! And you won't get away with this either. Neither shall you… Hiruzen… I know that you bear
a grudge against Kakashi. But that's no cause to target
one of our best shinobi. What are you talking about, Hiruzen? I could care less about Kakashi. However, he trespassed
by his own accord, into Foundation territory
and that is serious. "By his own accord"? No, I dispatched him with
a summons from me. Then he went looking for you. On my orders. There must've been
a communication mix-up. I'm hearing that for the first time. Well then, that settles it
with Kakashi. It's regarding this next issue
that I sent for you. It's regarding another
superior shinobi of this village. You know that the Wood Style user has long been desired
in Hidden Leaf Village. There even was a period when
we conducted tests to acquire that power. Now I understand there
is such a Wood Style user. Why would you keep him hidden
within the Foundation? I found him.
And I protected and raised him. It's not like I was hiding him. I just felt there was no need
to report it to you. Listen, Danzo. The Jinchuriki child is
now four years old. The Wood Style Sealing Jutsu
is becoming more and more crucial to the village. So… Will you entrust this user to me? I'll assign him to the ANBU
under my direct control. But… Please, Danzo. I know he is a valuable
subordinate to you. But for the sake of the Hidden Leaf,
transfer him to me. Then all will be settled amicably… Members of the Foundation
have a Curse Mark, so they do not
reveal top-secret intel. I will not remove the Curse Mark. That is fine. All right then… I now receive him into my care. Henceforth, you will be an ANBU
under my direct orders. Umm… Thank you for everything. H-Hello… I just transferred here from
the Foundation. I'm Kinoe. Hey, Tenzo! Tenzo? Kinoe was your codename
in the Foundation. In the ANBU,
you should call yourself Tenzo. But that name is… Didn't you call yourself Tenzo
in the past? All right, everyone! This is Tenzo, the newbie! I can vouch for his skill. Nice to meet you! Welcome! – Nice to meet you, Tenzo!
– I expect good things from you! Tenzo…huh? Tenzo, you're on my team. Team Ro! I'm counting on you. Okay, Senpai! As usual, your Lightning Blade
is as brilliant as ever, Senpai.

 There's no such thing as brilliant
or unsightly in assassination...

 Killing is just killing.

 Which reminds me, what happened
to the replacement...

 for the vacancy on our team?

 I'm in no rush.

 We're not in the middle of
a war or anything.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"An Uchiha ANBU"

 Sooner or later,
someone will show up.

 AN UCHIHA ANBU

 Tune in again!

 An Uchiha ANBU


 Damn it! As usual, your Lightning Blade
is as brilliant as ever, Senpai. Brilliant? There's no such thing as brilliant
or unsightly in assassination... A kill is a kill, that's all. By the way, what happened
to the replacement? Our team is short a member. There's no rush. We're not in the middle
of a war or anything. Sooner or later,
someone will show up. Hey, Kakashi. What's up? You look tired. Did you just get off a mission? You're such an idiot, Guy. Members of the ANBU can't
discuss details of their work! That's how it goes. We're going out for
some sweet dumplings. - Care to join us?
- Sorry, I don't really like sweets... He's gotten so antisocial lately. Maybe it's because of
all the secrecy in the ANBU... No! No way! Kakashi is my lifelong rival. He's got a heart that's filled
with burning passion. All right, since it's come to this,
it's up to me to do something! You? Please let me join the ANBU! It's the best thing to do
for Kakashi's sake! Now, now, Guy. I understand your concern
for Kakashi. But the saying "the right person
for the right job" applies to this situation... Your skills will not be optimized
in the ANBU. It's not about what's
good for me, Lord Third! As Kakashi's partner, I... Silence! You are not suited
for the ANBU. Not...suited... L-Lord Danzo... What is it? Please accept me
as one of your ANBU! You lack it. Lack what? Darkness. Darkness? A new member will be
joining your team. Is it the one
we previously discussed? Yes, he's extremely capable. But he's young. Danzo recommended that
he gain more experience. Here's your equipment. Thank you very much. I've been assigned to
the ANBU from today. My name is Itachi Uchiha. I'd appreciate your guidance. I see. So you're the one. Use the locker that's
the farthest one in the back. Yes, sir. Is that him? They say he's eleven years old. Doesn't that make him
the youngest ANBU ever? Team Ro is to assemble at
the Third Training Ground in five minutes. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Explain yourselves! We wanted to make sure he had
the skills to be one of us. Since he's too young. Do you have a problem with
the decision of your superiors? No, it's not like that... Haven't you already sensed
that he isn't ordinary? I'm Kakashi, captain of Team Ro. You're new, but I want you to learn the ANBU
rules and formations quickly. Yes, sir. He's good. He is talented,
but making an exception for someone so young is
rather unusual for the ANBU. Lord Danzo recommended him. No kidding?
He doesn't fit the mold though. What do you mean? Lord Danzo has
his own personal set of criteria for ANBU and Foundation agents. And? I just can't see him... I started my duties today. Is that so? That's my boy. I'm very proud that
you've joined the ANBU. But you must never
forget one thing. Before you are a Leaf ANBU, you are first and foremost,
Itachi of the Uchiha Clan. Yes, sir. The Uchiha Clan has been entrusted with the security of
Hidden Leaf Village. But because of that,
our clan has been relegated to living outside
the village boundaries. It is essential that our clan
has one of its own there. I am counting on you, Itachi. Fugaku Uchiha stood out as one of
the shrewdest security captains throughout the generations. I'm not surprised that
he's your father. This is not a criticism. Because the Hidden Leaf
ordered the Uchiha Clan outside the village limits,
but granted them self-governance, we cannot intervene
in their matters. Hence, we need our own
set of eyes and ears there. I'm counting on you, Itachi. Are you getting used to the job? Not yet. That's unlike you. I haven't gone out
on a mission yet. Protecting the Lord Hokage
is a mission in and of itself. Isn't the ANBU an assassination
and special tactical unit? Well, we're not at war right now. - Kakashi...
- Sir? As the Hokage, every deployment
I order is an official one. However, I cannot
ignore Danzo's view that there is an underside
to this mission. Hence, a separate unofficial team
will be dispatched. One that the Hokage didn't order? You will work under Danzo. On the surface,
this is a diplomatic mission. We will be exchanging intel
with the Hannya Black Ops of the Land of Woods
at the border. However...
I believe this is an enemy trap. Lord Third agrees with me on this. The ANBU will guard the team
on the official mission. When the enemy turns on
the team and attacks, kill them. Leave no survivors. Total annihilation? We must show them
that the Hidden Leaf does not tolerate betrayal. I'd like to be in
a two-man squad with Itachi. Fine. If I may take my leave... Kakashi... I recognize your worth
as an ANBU... I'm even tempted to pull you away
into my Foundation. Surely, you jest... I'm serious.
You have the right qualities. A quality called darkness. You will conduct a secret exchange with the Hannya Black Ops
of the Land of Woods. The Hidden Leaf will
hand over this scroll. And you will accept
a scroll from them. Do we verify the contents? This is a test of mutual trust. If they hand over a fake scroll, it will prove that
the Land of Woods has no interest in an alliance
with the Hidden Leaf. So if nothing happens,
we just bring back the scroll? Yes. Presently, we have no
hostility with the Land of Woods, but we cannot be certain.
Be very careful. Leave it to us! Hey, Itachi.
So it's your first ANBU mission. Right. I heard it's just Captain Kakashi
and you in a two-man squad. Watch your back. Why? If it's for the sake of a mission, the Captain won't hesitate
to kill a comrade. He's a shinobi
of the highest degree. Okay, everyone! Fire up your youthful passion
and...let's go! Please wait, Captain! I'm way past my youthful days... So they weren't told of
the true nature of this mission? No. The only ones who know
are the top ranks of the Leaf and the two of us. You're a godsend on
long-distance missions, Kosuke. Please have seconds. Everyone, eat up and replenish
your energy and chakra. But Captain, is it wise to burn
a fire out in the open like this? It's like we're just announcing
that we're here. What if the enemy attacks? If they want to attack, so be it. I have a hunch this mission
is to clarify whether they're friend or foe. That's amazing. He's only been told the superficial
facts of the mission, but he's figured out
its true purpose. We should eat too. Yes, sir. In a way, this symbolizes
the ANBU perfectly. What does? They sit out in the sun and
enjoy a hot-pot together. While we sit in the shadows
and eat food pills. I don't mind. I realize that
this is part of the job. I see. You're with the Hannya Black Ops
of the Land of Woods, correct? Indeed we are.
Now hand over the scroll! - All right then at the same time...
- You first. Fine then. There's no mistake. And your scroll? Here it is. Huh?! We're supposed to
exchange scrolls, not fire! The Hidden Leaf reneged on
our agreement and attacked us. We shall seek retribution. What a bold-faced lie. You're the one who broke
the agreement! Captain?! They planned on betraying us
from the beginning! We'll take over from here. - You guys get away from here.
- You guys?! - ANBU?!
- Reinforcements! - Earth Style!
- Earth Style! - Rock Collapse!
- Rock Collapse! Run! Earth Style... Mud Wall! Get out of here, you two! Yes, sir! Rumor has it that
you'd kill a comrade for the sake of a mission. I'll never let
my friends get killed. That's why I was entrusted
with this Sharingan. You get away from here too. Like I'd turn my back on a mission! Get on with it! - Earth Style!
- Earth Style! - Rock Collapse!
- Rock Collapse! Eight Inner Gates:
Fifth Gate of Closing! Open! He did that of all that
using only taijutsu?! Save the admiration for later! Retreat! Retreat! Your mission's complete. Return to the village. Hey, what are you doing?! This is the mission
we were assigned. Even still. Stop, Kakashi! Hey! What kind of idiot
calls someone by their name while they're on an ANBU mission?! You! Not to worry, Captain. No enemy survivors remain. I'm going to report back
to Lord Danzo. Your part of the mission
is complete. Captain... That Sharingan wasn't
originally yours, was it? No... Aren't you uncomfortable
about possessing a power that wasn't your own? You're not an Uchiha. But you possess the Sharingan, so you wield the same power
as the Uchiha. Whose side are you on? I've never thought about it
in that way. A friend entrusted
this Sharingan to me... who made me promise never to
forget what's important. A friend? To never let a friend get killed. I see, well done. Lord Third... I understand why you said that
the ANBU is not suited for me. I see... But I don't think that Kakashi is
suited to be in the ANBU either. Is that so? How did the newbie do? He passed with flying colors.
He'll be a better ANBU than me. No, you're an exceptional ANBU,
Senpai... There's a darkness associated
with ANBU missions. Why are you saying this
all of a sudden? All of a sudden? You're right. Deception and killing is
all part of the mission... Big Brother! Let's go home together, Sasuke! Okay! So you're done
with your mission? Big Brother! Guess what? My Sensei praised me
at the Academy today. Hey, Kakashi... Sorry about what happened
during the mission. No... I'm sorry too. Some of you may be aware, but my son Itachi has
joined the ANBU. Being in close vicinity to
the Hokage and the top ranks means access to more information. And that is a boon
for the Uchiha Clan. Itachi, do you have
anything to report? Well... I'm still new,
so there's not much to report. However, I don't think
there's solidarity in the higher ranks of the Leaf. It's my belief that how
the Uchiha Clan deals with this will determine the future
of the Hidden Leaf. Exactly. By all rights, the Uchiha Clan must be involved
in the future of the Hidden Leaf. - That's right!
- Right! - Yeah!
- Yes, that's right! That's the... Since you've been in the ANBU,

 this is a mission that
cannot be avoided.

 What kind of mission is this?

 Six years ago, during
the incident with the Nine Tails,

 The top ranks suspected
that was the Uchiha's doing.

 Since then, there's been
round-the-clock surveillance

 in the Uchiha district.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Coup d'État


 A mission is a mission.


 COUP D'ÉTAT


 Tune in again!


 Coup D'état


 You're part of the ANBU now and this is one mission
you cannot avoid. What kind of mission is this? When the Nine Tails incident
occurred six years ago, the higher-ups suspected
the Uchiha Clan was behind it. Since then, the Uchiha district has been
under 24-hour surveillance. Lord Third! The Nine Tails! The Nine Tails has suddenly
appeared in the Village! I'm aware of that! I will suppress it. You and the others,
protect the civilians! Yes, sir! You should have ordered the Uchiha
Police Force to guard the civilians and kept them in the rear. We can use the Visual Prowess of
the Uchiha to suppress the Nine Tails! They can also manipulate
the Nine Tails! If they take control of the Nine Tails,
and use it to their advantage, it will be like the second coming
of Madara Uchiha. I will leave you to
protect the civilians. Order the ANBU and
security units as you wish. Guard the village youth as well. Understood. This way, hurry! Calm down! You're safe here. Captain, we should go and assist. The Police Force will guard
the civilians. But Captain...! That's the order from the Village. It's over there! There, there. You're scared, huh? Now's our chance.
Let's get you to safety. There are too many
unanswered questions surrounding this recent
Nine Tails incident. I thought that Kushina's seal
had been broken. But that doesn't explain why Biwako
and the ANBU were killed. Which means someone is behind this. Like someone from the Uchiha? Why do you say that? Even if the Nine Tails broke free,
it would have just gone wild. Without someone to control it,
it couldn't have caused this incident. Hence, the Sharingan... The Uchiha can control the Nine Tails
with their Visual Prowess... But for what purpose? To regain their position of power
within the Hidden Leaf Village. I see... That's just conjecture. We must increase our surveillance
of the Uchiha. We must keep them
under 24-hour watch. That's bound to
incite them unnecessarily! Let the ANBU do it secretly. Better to be safe than sorry. Wait! We don't know if the Uchiha
are responsible for this. That's precisely why
this is necessary. And if nothing comes out of it... it will be to the Uchiha's benefit. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Kushina... Time to switch. Nothing to report. This is... This isn't the only
surveillance center around. Lord Danzo's ANBU are
also watching them. Now what'll you do? Notify your clan about this? What is my job here? Just keep watching through that. Okay, Captain. We're going. Stay alert, Itachi. This is part of our job as ANBU. It's not assassination but it's still dirty work. A mission is a mission. You'll be spying on your friends
and family. It's even dirtier. I can take this shift,
if you want. No, that's not necessary.
Besides... Besides? The Uchiha Clan is aware
that they're under suspicion. I guess you would be. Go to hell! What the hell was that for?! You're the one that... It's your fault. - It wasn't me!
- Sure, it was! Hey, stop that! Hey, what's going on?! Calm down! Why you...! Who needs the Police Force?! Just go and hide like you did
with the Nine Tails! What did you say? Ow ow ow! We're taking you both into custody! Let me go! Be quiet and walk! It was just a drunken argument... Couldn't they just
stop the fighting? Complaints about harsh treatment
by the Police Force are on the rise. People have started
to distrust them. The Uchiha are growing impudent. No, it's backlash. The negativity from the Nine Tails' incident
six years ago still hangs over them. The Uchiha didn't suffer
any damage that time. That is the cause of suspicion... Furthermore, the Uchiha viewed
our distancing them from the Nine Tails as a sign of
the Hidden Leaf's distrust. Our strategy of isolating the Uchiha
is a fundamental policy of the Leaf put in place by Lord Second. Why are they raising a fuss
after all this time? The Lord Second's intention
wasn't isolation. He was just concerned for each clan. Have you forgotten about
our friend Kagami Uchiha? I haven't forgotten. He saved me many times
with his Visual Jutsu. The Uchiha Clan is
a friend of the Hidden Leaf. We must ensure
they stay that way. If we can... Calm down! A genjutsu!
But when did that happen? Byakugan! We're retreating! But Captain...! It's Shisui Uchiha,
the Teleporter of the Leaf. We're no match for him. Retreat! That should keep the Hidden Mist
quiet for a while. Team Shisui has returned and
our mission was successfully completed. That was a long mission.
Thank you for your hard work. Go and rest. I have a request, Lord Third. I'm very troubled by the suspicion
cast upon the Uchiha Clan. So am I. I'm hoping that
my clan and the Village will be able to trust
each other again. Will you assign this mission to me? Do you want to be released
from your regular duties? Yes. And I'd like to be given
a certain amount of authority. All right. Let's say I ordered you on
a top-secret investigative mission. If anyone objects, tell them my name, and I will take full responsibility. Thank you. You remind me so much
of my old friend, Kagami Uchiha. I am nowhere near his caliber. Big Brother! Are you done with your mission? If you are, help me train! Sorry, Sasuke.
I have an urgent summons. We played here a lot. So you were back. Yeah. We finally chased
the Hidden Mist away. Why did you want to see me? I want to hear
your honest opinion. How serious do you think Fugaku is? What do you mean by serious? A coup d'état. Dissatisfaction towards the Village
is growing among the Uchiha. If the Village doesn't change,
the Uchiha won't stand for it anymore. If the Village changes,
so will the Uchiha. But if the Uchiha doesn't change,
neither will the Village. As long as the two sides
distrust each other, things will only get worse. I want to clear up that suspicion. You think you can? I don't know, but I have to try... If the Uchiha attempts a coup d'état,
it will bode badly for both sides. I'm against a coup d'état as well. But it will take something big
to stop it. I know.
But you shouldn't do anything. Why's that? Some members on the Police Force
are suspicious of you... and I've been ordered
to spy on you. What?! Do you know what day tomorrow is?! You don't understand
your own position! I'm setting out on
a mission tomorrow. What kind of mission? I can't tell you...
It's top-secret. Itachi... You also serve as
the Uchiha Clan's pipeline to the Village nerve center. You know that, don't you? Yes... Bear that in mind. And come to tomorrow's assembly! The Uchiha are assembling
again tonight. I know about it as well. But we cannot interfere
with their clan rituals. Rituals indeed! They're going to fan the flames
of distrust against us, then use it to unite the clan. They are preparing for a coup d'état. And the one to nip it
in the bud is... Shisui! Shisui Uchiha? Shisui will attend the assembly. And if Fugaku Uchiha incites
a rebellion... I will use my Kotoamatsukami. Your Visual Jutsu... He will have no clue that Shisui
is controlling his actions. He will believe that
his words are his own. I'm going to make Fugaku think
about co-existence with the Village. I don't think that
controlling only Fugaku will put an end to
the Uchiha's dissatisfaction. No. If the Uchiha will change,
then we of the Leaf must change too. Let us improve our relations
with the Uchiha. That is my hope. I will assign one ANBU
behind the scenes. I'm counting on you, Shisui. Yes, sir! Itachi isn't coming, is he? He's late. What is it, Lord Danzo? It's almost time for
the assembly to start. Even if you use your Visual Jutsu
on Fugaku to get the clan to cooperate, what if the Village doesn't change? Lord Hokage has promised
to make it change. Even if Lord Third is satisfied, the distrust among
the Leaf will not go away. I realize that. But in time... Besides, someone who's always suspicious
like me will never change. What will you do then? But Lord Danzo... When the time comes, will you use your Kotoamatsukami
on me too? I'm... Your Sharingan...
shall be in my safekeeping! Forgive me. It's only genjutsu...
You'll snap out of it shortly. Sharingan?! I'm going to take it
to replace this eye. Give me the other one too. Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Water Style! Raging Waves! It's a Teleportation Jutsu! Go after him. Is that you, Shisui? Come with me. It's too late to stop
the coup d'état by the Uchiha. If civil war breaks out
in the Leaf Village, other nations are sure
to attack... which means a full-scale war. I was going to try to stop
the coup d'état with Kotoamatsukami, but... Lord Danzo took my right eye... He doesn't trust me. He intends to protect
the Village his own way, no matter what it takes
or how it looks. I suspect he'll come after
my left eye as well. So I want to give it to you
before he has a chance. Shisui. You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend. Please protect this Village...
and the honor of the Uchiha name. I accept it. What will you do now? If I die, several circumstances
will change. I've left behind a note already... Wait, Shisui! Don't stop me, Itachi. If you're my friend... Shisui! Shisui... Oww! What are you accusing me of?! Just be quiet! Don't be so rough. Captain... You are a suspect... and you're coming to
Headquarters with us. F-Fine... Remember to follow
our investigative procedures! Yes, sir! C'mon, move. Shisui Uchiha was a core member
of the Uchiha. His suicide demoralized and
lessened their fighting power all at once. So the coup d'état has been foiled. Are you saying
there was no other way but for Shisui to give his life? I shouldn't have pushed him... There are a few among the Uchiha who believe that you killed Shisui. The ones who believe that
did not know that Shisui and I were working
towards the same goal. Shisui did not appear at
our rendezvous point. He had secrets,
so he was suspected. I will notify the ANBU that
it was officially a suicide. Agreed, Hiruzen? That's the Lightning Blade! You're...the Copy Ninja of the Leaf! Kaka...shi... You've become quite well known. Do it long enough and
you're bound to become famous. Clear the area. Leave no trace of the Hidden Leaf. Yeah, yeah. I know. Dirty work is part of
the ANBU's modus operandi. You said that a friend gave
your Sharingan to you. Along with a wish. Do you need to honor that wish? Yes, I intend to. I know about
the Shisui Uchiha incident. Is it about that? No, I'm fine. I see... Anyway, there's not a lot I can do,
but let me know if there's anything. Yes. You're the only person I can count on,
my best friend. Please protect this Village...
and the honor of the Uchiha name.  Shisui.  Things have gotten much worse
since then.  I don't think
I can protect everyone. It seems someone has been
infiltrating the Village recently.

 The only thing we can do is
to ask the Police Force

 to step up their patrols.

 What happened?

 I went to the Uchiha District
for the first time in a long time.

 It felt like they didn't want
any outsiders there.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Night of the Tragedy"

 I see... THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY


 Tune in again!


 The Night of the Tragedy


 Due to an increasing amount of assignments, I've decided to add
an additional team to the ANBU. Itachi, I'm appointing you captain. Yes, sir. I'm not opposed,
but you are very young. How old are you? I'm thirteen. There are a number of shinobi who
were younger and have become jonin. Just two years in the ANBU
and already a captain. He must be the youngest captain
the ANBU has ever had. I shall assign my ANBU agents
to this new team. So does that mean you're going to
be transferred to Lord Danzo's ANBU? I wonder? Try not to get caught in between
the political wrangling of the higher-ups. Captain Kakashi... Thank you for the past two years. Come on now.
You're only changing sections. You're still a Hidden Leaf shinobi. It's not like you're going far away. TRAINING GROUND THREE
 He's 13 years old. And they're making him a captain? Well, he's an extraordinary shinobi. Sure, he has the Sharingan.
But making captain at 13 is unheard of. What's up, Yugao? I've been assigned to Team Ro,
starting from today. So you're the replacement? I'll do my best, Kakashi Senpai. All right. Attention! I'm looking forward to your good work. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! I've gotten reports that the Police Force
is strengthening their armaments. What do you make of this? Dissatisfaction towards the Hidden Leaf
is running high among the Uchiha. We can't ignore it anymore, it seems. Yes... You are aware of
the Leaf's barrier system? It senses when the Village
has been infiltrated. Someone has been getting through
the barrier undetected. Even among the Hidden Leaf, only a few know the secret code
to pass through the barrier. Either there's a traitor in our midst, or a jutsu user who
can break the barrier. If it's a traitor, we can smoke him out by changing
the jutsu formula. I believe it's someone capable of
passing through the barrier with a jutsu. I don't want to believe that. I want you to look into this. This is a chart of the barrier placements. The alert is high in some spots. Where is this? The area around Uchiha District. If possible, we'd like to install
a barrier system there, but it's a self-governing district
and our hands are tied. Make sure your investigation
does not trace back to the ANBU. Get this! There's no way
I'm going to lose to you! Keep on blabbing. Shut up! You shut up. Curious finding you here. What brings you to the Academy
after so long? I've been appointed a jonin leader,
in charge of the genin. So you're going to look after the genin? But I'm a bit worried about
the kind of students I'm getting. Quit acting so high and mighty, Sasuke! You're so annoying. Why you…! Students like that will
be hard to handle. Come with me, will you? You want to spar? Let's just take a walk. This is the Uchiha District. This part of town has character. It's the first time
I've been here in a long time. I used to come here a lot... long ago. Now that's a rice cracker shop
with character. Hey, what're you doing? It's way past our rendezvous time. Is there something special
about this house? It's nothing. These rice crackers are really good. They're worth coming all the way here for. They've got some other stuff
you can only find here. You've got to show me! Where are we? Nakano Shrine,
home of the Uchiha's patron deity. I'm an agnostic. Just be a sport and go pull
a fortune for yourself. Captain Kakashi! Itachi... What are you doing here? I was thinking about
something from the past. How about you? I'm from here. I come here often. How is it being a captain? There's no change.
I have the same kind of missions. I see... Hey, Kakashi! I got "Excellent Luck"!
I drew "Excellent Luck"! There's not enough intel to
figure out who the infiltrator is or what he wants. We need to place agents at
every section of the barrier system to coordinate with the barrier team. Without infiltration tactics,
it's impossible to track down the culprit. Unfortunately, we can't spare
the manpower for such an operation. All we can do is to ask the Police Force
to step up their patrols, but… What is it? Well… I went to the Uchiha District
for the first time in a long time. Something about the atmosphere
had changed. I'd describe it as...tense. Were they antisocial? Yes, they were. It felt like
they didn't want any outsiders there. I see... I'll discuss the Police Force
with the executive committee. You have completed your mission. How convenient. Under the pretext of village security,
we'll create a new patrol unit. We'll switch over duties from the Police Force
and reduce their strength. No, that will only incite the Uchiha. We'll make the Police Force
oversee the patrols and increase their workload. At a time when we should
be stopping their coup d'état, why would you increase
the Uchiha's power? I will not allow the Uchiha
to stage a coup d'état! That goes without saying!
As if we'd let them. Calm down, both of you. We don't know if there will
be a coup or not. We should bide our time and
see how it pans out. That is why we have Itachi.
Isn't that right? Isn't Itachi coming? He's on a mission. The Uchiha Clan intends to
revolt against the Hidden Leaf. What? You obtained proof of that? Yes... Hey. There's something I want you
to help me with. I will not let the Uchiha stage
a coup d'état. That's one thing we agree on. Hold on now! We haven't come to
a conclusion yet! If the Uchiha are getting ready to act,
we must prepare too. Preparations only, Danzo. Tonight is the night. Fine. I shall assist you as promised. I'm counting on you. I'm going to help you annihilate
the Uchiha because I have another goal. I want you to keep
your "eyes closed" for that... So I'm not to use my Sharingan against
whatever you're planning? Yes. Then I will guarantee that
I will not kill your little brother... I have no use for a child
without the Sharingan. And that's supposed to reassure me? At this point, I have no other choice
but to trust you. If you need a place to go,
join my organization. Your organization? I call it the Akatsuki. ANBU It's an Emergency Alert, Level 1! Get ready to move out! Hurry! Identify yourself! Move out! My team will go to the Hidden Leaf
Police Force Headquarters! My team will go to Uchiha District! This is horrible! What the hell? Rescue anyone who is still alive! There's a survivor! Take him to the Medical Unit! Everyone else is dead. Take away the corpses. I mean, every single one. Check inside the buildings as well. Who could have done such a thing? Itachi Uchiha. Itachi?! Itachi Uchiha despised his clan. That is why he killed Shisui
and took his eyes, and caused in-fighting among
his brethren...and then finally... He caused this atrocity. But, why would he...? Enough talking. Get to work! This settles everything. What does this settle? Don't you see the huge problem
we're left with?! I consider it very minor. Danzo, I cannot allow you to act
on your own authority any longer. As of this moment, you are relieved of your duties
as second in command. But Hiruzen, I did it for... "The good of the Leaf"? Well then, the Uchiha Clan belonged
to the Hidden Leaf. Your ANBU and Foundation
will be dissolved! I will deal with you later. Until then,
you are confined to your quarters! Lord Danzo, the body count
doesn't match up. What did you say? It's like they just disappeared. I witnessed everything. And I will continue to watch. If you as much as touch Sasuke, I will pass on classified Village intel
to every enemy nation. Damn you... If this is the scope of Itachi's hatred,
it ran very, very deep... Just one survivor... Start taking them away. Yes, sir. What a mission, even for an ANBU. What's up with him? Hey! The entire clan was annihilated... Not everyone.
I hear one child survived. What's the difference? The Uchiha Clan is extinct. All except one. I never imagined that Itachi Uchiha
would be placed in the Bingo Book. ITACHI UCHIHA

In the S-class right from the start. Well, he slaughtered so many of his clan... What's wrong, Senpai? It just goes to show
I knew nothing about him. I understood nothing. By the way, I hear Uchiha District
will be razed to the ground. Razed? NO TRESPASSING

A terrible incident took place there.
No one would want to go near it. Obito... What have I been doing...
since that day? I know you have something to say... No one is with me. Thank you for your consideration. First, you have my gratitude. Civil war has been averted
in Hidden Leaf Village. Peace in the village has been maintained. Yes. But even so, I regret that
there was no other way. I'm sorry. I am the one who must apologize. Henceforth, you will be branded
a Rogue Ninja who killed his entire clan... And be listed in the Bingo Book
as a fugitive, wanted dead or alive. That goes without saying. What will you do now? I've enlisted the aid of a group
named Akatsuki. I intend to stay close to them to
make sure a promise is not broken. You're joining the Akatsuki? Lord Third, will you swear to me
that you will protect Sasuke? Your younger brother will continue
to study at the Academy and grow up to become
a Hidden Leaf shinobi. He will want for nothing, however... I will not be able to erase
his hatred towards you. I am prepared to bear his hatred. Now go... I will leave the jutsu formula for
the barrier around the Village unchanged. Whenever you are worried about Sasuke,
you can sneak in. Lord Third... It's too bad that the Uchiha Clan
did not understand your compassion. That wasn't it. I was weak... That is what brought on this tragedy. I'm considering a complete makeover of Danzo's Foundation
and my ANBU. Plus we need a new Police Force. Instead of sticking to one clan, let's have an open recruitment
for the Police Force. We must think about
the Leaf Village's future, and find the right person
for the right job. You wanted to see me? Tell me, Kakashi. How many years have you been
in the ANBU? I joined during the Fourth Hokage's tenure,
so...about ten years. Minato's original purpose in making you
a member of the ANBU was to help you deal with
the sadness in your heart. He wanted to keep you close to him. I kind of figured that. Then Minato died, and I resumed
the position of Hokage, and took Minato's ANBU
under my command. But keeping you by my side
isn't going to help you. In fact, it will only darken your heart. Take off your mask. Ten years... Perhaps I have asked
too much of you. You are hereby relieved of
your duties as an ANBU, and will assume a new position. Yes, sir! You will be a jonin leader! Huh?! I have no intention of making people
who don't work as a team into shinobi!

 You all fail. You're going back
to the academy.

 That frozen gaze...
It's darkness itself!

 I guess his darkness hasn't
been dispelled yet.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Jonin Leader"

 I guess more time is needed.

<i>Resembles Sasuke, huh...?</i> <i>I guess there's
<i>a small resemblance, but...</i> What is it? <i>He kind of talks like...him too...</i> Please don't stare at me like that... I'll pound you. Hey! You tick me off with
everything you say! <i>He doesn't resemble Sasuke at all!</i> I don't really mean it. You liar! I'm just trying to portray myself
like that kind of character. Portray yourself...? Then you <i>do</i>  mean it! You won't do at all! You really tick me off! Hey! Hey! Don't act like that... in front of your captain, Naruto. I'm sure Kakashi taught you that trust and teamwork
are most important to a team. You were on the same team
as the great Kakashi... Make-Out Paradise
Deluxe Edition What's your problem? He's not a member of Team Kakashi! The other member of
our Team Kakashi is... Sasuke! This guy was just chosen to
cover the loss of Sasuke... I don't acknowledge him
as a team member... Well... That's actually easier for me. He betrayed the Leaf and ran off
to serve Orochimaru... I don't want to be lumped together
with a cockroach along the same lines... as Orochimaru. Y-You creep! Teamwork is indeed important. Sai... Naruto still doesn't know you
very well. So he may have been out of line. I'm sorry... Please forgive Naruto... Sakura... Thank goodness I've got at least
one kid who's less objectionable. It's okay. It doesn't bother me. Really? Thank goodness. <i>The Fake Smile

 
</i> I wonder if they're getting along... The new Team Kakashi, that is. I'm sure it'll work out. They're not rookies anymore. They're full-fledged Shinobi now. But it seems Naruto and
the new team member Sai... aren't really getting along very well. And who's fault was it that
a team member Naruto can't get along with was added to Team Kakashi?! I-I never thought one of
Lord Danzo's subordinates would end up joining their team... There's no time for excuses!
Get a move on! Find out about Danzo's intentions
and Sai's background! Got it, Shizune?! Y-Yes, ma'am. I've left the Naruto and Sai matter
to Sakura. She should be able to set things right! About that Sakura... What is it?! N-No, it's nothing. <i>I get the feeling...</i> <i>Sakura's becoming more and more
<i>like Lady Tsunade these days...</i> <i>I hope she can mediate between
<i>Naruto and Sai all right.</i> <i>Surely she isn't throwing gas
<i>on the fire...</i> <i>What--?!</i> You don't have to...forgive me. You tricked me good...
with your fake smile earlier... And here you don't even know
anything about Sasuke... Don't you ever speak ill about him! If you insult Sasuke again, I won't hold back. Fine... I won't say anything like that
in front of you again. So that's another way of using
a fake smile, huh...? I'll remember that. How can you grin like that
after getting punched?! A smile is the best way to get
through a tough situation. Even if it's a fake smile. Surprisingly enough,
everyone gets fooled. That's what it said in the book. It seems it doesn't really work
if I do it, though. You jerk! Four-Pillar Prison Jutsu! I'll really toss you guys into
this cell if you keep fighting. We don't have much time
until we get to the Tenchi Bridge. That being said... we've still got enough time
to take a little detour. Th-This is... <i>This is the secret Jutsu that
<i>only the First Hokage could use...</i> <i>The Wood Style Ninjutsu!</i> <i>How come Captain Yamato
<i>can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu?</i> <i>Who the heck is this guy...?</i> As your peacemaker,
I offer you this suggestion. In order to improve your rapport, I can toss you guys into
this cell for a full day or we can stay at a hot spring inn
for a night. Which would you prefer? You guys probably don't really
know me all that well. I prefer the kind and gentle approach, but I'm not against controlling you
by fear either. Sure enough, getting naked together
like this is a great way to bond, isn't it?! Don't you think so? Y-Yes, that's right! <i>His eyes are totally scary!</i> <i>He's already controlling us
<i>with fear...</i> Oh... So you <i>do</i>
have "equipment," after all. Don't be looking! Naruto...? Shut up with all that talk about
my "equipment!" <i>For crying out loud, Naruto...
<i>You're talking too loud!</i> You jerk! It's your fault I'm being laughed at... Aren't you glad that Sakura's pleased, too? Sakura...? Now then... I'm getting out now. Before that, let me tell you
an interesting story, Naruto. When Master Jiraiya was young,
there was one time when he almost died. He broke six ribs and both arms,
and several of his internal organs ruptured... It seems Lady Tsunade beat him up
real good with her incredible strength... This happened because
he did what you're now... attempting to do... I wonder
what Sakura would do.... It looks like
things are going to get busy... Come in. Excuse me. Shall I start preparing your meals? Yes, please. I'll bring them right away then. That was a nice bath. Naruto... I'll be getting out, too... Please be careful not to stay
in the water too long. You'll get dizzy. <i>Idiot, idiot, are you an idiot?</i> I've never seen such magnificent food! Man, it sure looks good... Say! Say! Captain Yamato! What is it, Naruto? Is it really okay if we eat all this? Sure. Help yourself. Yes! Thank you! Thank you. What should I start with...? Mmm, tasty! It <i>really</i>  is good. If we get food this
awesome every mission, Captain Yamato can stay
with us forever! Yeah, that's right. Let's have Kakashi Sensei stay
in the hospital a little while longer. Umm...when can I eat...? For awhile, you'll only
get food intravenously. You still can't move your arms
and legs freely, after all... Oh, I see... Once you can move your arms and legs,
you'll go on a liquid diet. It'll still be quite awhile before
you can eat solid food. I want to...eat something... I'm stuffed... Thank you for the meal. Thank you. Now then, normally after dinner, I'd want to have a meeting
regarding the mission... But the reason why we're staying here is for improvement of your rapport. Let's forget about
the serious stuff for now. Now you're talking, Captain Yamato. Instead we'll definitely have
a meeting tomorrow! Could it be we're going to stay at
a hot springs inn tomorrow, too? No, cut me some slack on that one.
My wallet won't make it. Then could it be that
you're paying for this place out of your own pocket, Captain Yamato? Yes. Awesome! You're sure generous! It's settled! Captain Yamato will be
the captain of Team Kakashi! Yeah! I second that! I sure slept well. The weather's nice today, too. Sai... What's he doing over there...? Oh, Sai. So you draw, huh? Is there something you want? Nothing special. I was just thinking
that surprisingly enough, you've got a sensitive side
despite being so foul-mouthed. You really just haven't finished
hitting me, have you? No way. Hey, I just came to have
a peek at what you're drawing. I see. But it's strange. I totally thought you were drawing
a landscape since you're out here drawing. Hey, this is an abstract, isn't it...? Next episode: "Untitled" Jonin Leader

 Hey, Kakashi! Come join us for
some sweet dumplings! Me? A jonin leader
in charge of genin? Minato Sensei… You're late, Obito! You're finally here…
You must be Obito. We've been waiting for you. Barely made it… You're really late. We've already introduced ourselves.
You're the only one left! I'm going to be the Hokage! My name's Obito Uchiha! For my Great Stone Face, make sure my trademark goggles and
Sharingan are nicely carved out! So I can glare over
the neighboring lands! I'll scare the hell out of them
with my Sharingan stare… and no one will
dare attack our village! Rattle off your instructions
after you become the Hokage and activate your Sharingan. Besides, how can they carve the Sharingan
if you're wearing goggles? They can carve it out over my goggles! Then it will look like your eyeballs
are popping out. Anyway… I'm happy that someone on
this team shares my dream. I'm Minato.
From today, I'll be your superior. I'm glad to meet you! Yeah! All right, let's have
our first practice together. Y-Yes! In this training session,
I want to see your teamwork. Teamwork? Take these two bells away from me,
and practice will be over. Simple, right? Two bells mean… Exactly. Huh? What does it mean? One of us will be dropped
from the team. What?! Good observation. Okay… Let's start. I'm your jonin leader, Hatake… Kakashi Sensei, right? Never mind the formalities… Let's just get started! What you're going to do… has a failure rate of 66%. During that practice,
I wasn't even thinking of teamwork. And Minato Sensei
didn't even notice it. You all pass! Let's strengthen
our teamwork even more! – Right!
– Yes! In other words, one of you will definitely
be sent back to the Academy. It's no wonder Minato Sensei
didn't notice. I pretended to work with the team
and used the other two. I know he's giving us a break… But Minato Sensei is way too skilled. There's no way I can do it alone. Close! Whoa… You'll never get it
at the rate you're going. I knew it. Minato Sensei is making
an allowance for our skill levels! Compared to how he is
against Obito and Rin… With me,
he doesn't ease up as much. At this rate,
I'm definitely not getting a bell. In order to complete this mission… Obito! Rin! The first formation we learned
at the academy! Huh? I doubt if a simple formation like that
would work against Minato Sensei. Just do it! I guess it's worth a try. It's better than doing nothing… Okay, I'm in! Here we go! – Yeah!
– Right! I see only one opening
with Minato Sensei. If I use these two to trap him,
we have a chance! Okay, let's start That wasn't teamwork. Back then, if only
Minato Sensei had seen that something was missing
in our teamwork… Thanks for letting me get the bell first! Looks like you're going
to be left behind! No… That wasn't…Minato Sensei's fault! I'm just trying to pass the buck,
and running away from the truth… That's why… with these guys… I'm going to make sure
their teamwork is solid. You're so clumsy… You're a disgrace. Huh?! Speak for yourself! Damn it… Of all the luck… To be lumped together
with guys like you. Say that again! This is hilarious. You guys are so ridiculous! Say, I just had a great idea. What a coincidence. Me too. Me too! We don't want to give Sensei
a hard time… I agree! So I… – will…
– decide… - …who drops out!
- …who drops out! You guys. Huh? You all fail! You're going back to the academy. That frozen gaze… It's darkness itself…
His darkness hasn't been dispelled yet. More time is necessary… Rin… Obito… I know. I have no intention of making people
who don't work as a team into shinobi… No matter what anyone says… Now then… How will this year turn out…? Keep it up and you'll end up back
at the academy! I'm in the spring of youth
at full power! No wonder he's a jonin. He dodges my taijutsu
with such ease. I thought graduating from
the academy made us genin. Failing now is too embarrassing! Severe…Leaf Hurricane! Giving up already? I'm not giving up! My dream is to become a great shinobi
through taijutsu alone! I cannot…abandon my dream! That's ridiculous… But… I'm not throwing in the towel either! That's right! I'm that close to becoming
the kunoichi I've always admired! No way am I calling it quits! Now you're talking, guys! That's how youth should be! Even if you've used up
every ounce of your energy… suck it up and push through it! Hit me with all your might! – Here we come!
– Here we come! The three of you… …all pass! Yes! I did it! I did it! I-I can't breathe…! I'm so happy we all made it! I wasn't about to fail
after coming this far. But… Thank goodness we didn't get
the sensei everyone talks about. You mean that jonin who sent the three
before us back to the academy? Uh-huh. Luck has nothing to do
with real strength. Those guys just weren't
good enough. That's not what I heard. It was about what's even more important
than a shinobi's strength or something… And what is that? Is it some kind of
super-lethal-one-hit technique? But who does he think he is
to make up his own criteria? Kakashi… Are you sure about this,
big brother? Maybe we shouldn't eat
the bento lunches… Look, have I ever been wrong? But Kakashi Sensei's not here. Quit nitpicking! You two, just listen and follow the rules! Sure, in the world of Ninja, one who breaks the rules and regulations
is regarded as scum… But those who abandon their comrades…
are worse than scum! Obito… I… Kakashi Sensei…! I've failed, but my kid brothers
followed the rules! The three of you… Each of you obeyed my orders. You stuck to the rules. But you didn't follow what
is most important to a shinobi… What is that?! You grey-haired…! You're all going back to
the academy to figure it out. Passed on the Chunin Exams? That's unusually cautious of you, Guy. Yeah… Huh? The Chunin Exams? Yes. The way the system works is,
if you complete over eight missions… you qualify to participate
in the Chunin Exams. There haven't been rookies
in the Chunin Exams lately… Would you like to go for it? Uh…! Huh? What's wrong, Lee? Well… I'd like to test myself
to see how strong I am… I do have that desire… But… But what? I don't deserve to take the test
at my present level. I know my own ability best! What about you, Neji? I'll pass on it too. Huh? Neji, you'd make it to chunin
in no time! That's why there's no point
in rushing. I see. And you, Tenten? Then I'll pass too! Let's train hard and take
the next exams together! You guys! You guys… Having students like you
makes me very happy! Dumplings! Another order
of dumplings, please! Coming right up! I don't get it…
But this is so like you. By the way, what's it like to be
in charge of fresh academy graduates? That's right. This is your first time. Hmm? Hey, Kakashi! Come join us for some
sweet dumplings! What's with him? His eyes are as cold as ever…
like he never left the ANBU. He failed every one of them again. That's not such a big deal. No, but the darkness in
Kakashi's heart is a problem. He's still carrying that around… They were my classmates too.
And I grieved as well, but… You've got to get over it… I know… I knew that the depressing atmosphere of
the ANBU would turn him more sullen. Lord Third! The ANBU isn't for someone
like Kakashi! I know it isn't my place
to say this, Lord Third! But… We've lost too many of our friends…! Watching Kakashi…
It's as though he's in a hurry to die… That's why…we came up with this idea
to put him in charge of the genin… If he has subordinates to look after,
we're sure he'll change… Hmm… You think so too? So then…?! Maybe we shouldn't have interfered… We each thought that rather
than being in the ANBU, being in charge of young future shinobi
held more promise for him, but… Lord Third! Lord Third? Lord Third?! At ease, finish your tea. In fact, I'll have a cup too. I see… What's so funny? You always treat us like we're kids… Asuma! Oh… Forgive me for laughing. I must admit that I do treat you
like children. Minato Sensei… Is my way wrong…? – Kakashi Sensei!
– Kakashi Sensei! Y-Yes? – Good morning, sir!
– Good morning, sir! Kakashi Sensei! We're in charge of
academy discipline now! We realized everything starts
with a proper greeting! That greeting was spot on! Keep it up! – Yes!
– Yes! Please excuse us! – Excuse us!
– Excuse us! – Excuse us!
– Excuse us! Who cares about greetings?
Let's get started. Those guys, huh… It's Kakashi Sensei! It's you! – Thank you very much!
– Thank you very much! W-What?! Thank you for failing us in that practice… we were able to change! Huh? We always depended
on our big brother… and never stood up for ourselves… Actually, that time, we wanted to
share our lunch with him! After the practice, we realized
that we should've spoken up and told you how we felt. Right? Yeah… I thought I was helping them,
but I was stifling them instead. I learned a lesson too. – And so…!
– And so…! – We're so grateful to you, Kakashi Sensei!
– We're so grateful to you, Kakashi Sensei! Grateful…to me…? A teacher trains his students… and at the same time,
learns from them. Only through mutual respect
and growth… can you foster
a true teacher-pupil relationship. It is my hope that you will nurture
such a relationship with your pupils. Of course, I wish it for Kakashi as well. Lord Third! Is that… Oh…it's still very secret. But this is the list of
academy graduates who will be under Kakashi's tutelage. NINJA DATA

I'm sure it's a group of
highly individualistic kids. I'm sure this new batch of genin
will hold your interest.


 Where are we?


 This is Naruto's house.


 Lord Fourth's orphan…


 Are you our sensei?


 I'm Naruto Uzumaki,
I'm going to be Hokage!


 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Squad Seven"


 That kid is a genin? SQUAD SEVEN


 Tune in again!


 Squad Seven



 Regarding the next group of genin
that you'll be in charge of… Me? Again? Now don't look so upset. Guy has already formed his squad and has gone out on missions
with them. Aren't you eager to set out with
your own apprentices? Well… I'm sure this new batch of genin
will hold your interest. Where are we? This is Naruto Uzumaki's house. Lord Fourth's orphan. So that child is a genin. Are you a little interested now? So this is where Naruto lives. Yes. This milk is way past
its expiration date. Minato Sensei was so meticulous.
I can't believe this is his son. He's a bit of a fool, but it would be best if
you looked after him. You have good instincts. That Uchiha boy, Sasuke, is
also on your squad. I wish you the best of luck. Understood. What have I gotten myself into? Next up is a kunoichi— Welcome, Lord Third!
And Kakashi Sensei as well! Our Sakura, will be under
your supervision! Come in and
have some tea! I'll hurry and get it rea-tea! I couldn't resist saying that! Oh, stop! You're so silly! I'm here unofficially. So if I accept an invitation for tea
at a student's home, other parents might frown upon it. Oh, please don't be so formal. Yes! Thanks to you, we live in peace and have nothing
to worry about, Lord Hokage! No one would dare complain. Please, you too, Kakashi Sensei! After all, you're going to be
our daughter's sensei. So please come in! This is really not looking good... The last up one is…
Sasuke Uchiha's house. At one time, the Uchiha lived in
a special autonomous district. Now, only Sasuke remains… Sasuke's father Fugaku Uchiha
was very strict. Seems the boy is very disciplined. His older brother Itachi was
very meticulous as well. Yes, I remember. I assigned him under you. Look after the younger one as well I'm asking in place of
their father, Fugaku. I didn't have to teach Itachi a thing. His Sharingan was far
more effective than mine. Regardless, you are the only Leaf Shinobi
who possesses a Sharingan now. We don't know yet if Sasuke
will be able to activate his… but if he does,
you must be there for him. Yes… Obito, you—! This is where… I'll protect my friends! Obito… Kakashi… Rin… The shadow of tragedy
trails this eye. It might be best not to activate
the Sharingan at all. But… But for better or for worse, this eye holds a key into how
I feel about my comrades. If one thinks that there is a downside to having these kinds of feelings...
that it attracts tragedy… then I must see to it that
they treasure their comrades, in order to prevent that
from happening. It seems your judging criteria
remains unchanged this year. Still… This room is quite a contrast
from Naruto's. Why? Why what? Why did you put me in charge
of those three? Well, there's a hopeless fool,
a skilled protégé and a clever kunoichi… I'd say it's much like
Minato's old team. S-So you chose me on purpose?! Listen Kakashi, I am the Hokage. I would never base
my personnel decisions on personal preference! It's all about the right man
for the right job… I carefully consider each of
these assignments… Separately from what the teachers
at the Academy believe. Sasuke and Naruto will be
on the same squad? That's brilliant! Sasuke graduated at the top of
his class out of 27 students… Whereas Naruto was last in class. It seems you did that to keep
the squad balanced! These are times when
a squad's composition greatly affects shinobi and their actions,
and subsequently, their success rate. It is the duty of those who govern to maintain special teams that
possess a variety of skills. For example, Guy's team that
was formed last year. It certainly doesn't
have the kind of balance the instructors at
the Academy recommend. It's a squad that specializes largely
in taijutsu. You're right. This year, they have really
come into their own. I also intend to organize specialty military squads
that utilize Secret Ninjutsu. From that perspective, Naruto is the Jinchuriki
of the Nine Tails… and Sasuke has the potential
to activate the Sharingan… As I mentioned earlier, you are the only one who can
advise Sasuke with his Sharingan. Looking ahead, it is imperative  that Sasuke awaken his Sharingan
that can control the Nine Tails… That night's tragedy
must never happen again. I understand that those two are special. But what about the girl Sakura? Well, I believe she has
the potential to be a good kunoichi. Right now, she's average. However… Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu! He's already picked up
one of my jutsu! Good one, Orochimaru! I can do that too! What? You too, Jiraiya? Shu…Shuriken… Whatever Jutsu…! Talent attracts people… Men notice women… And rivalry matures both… So they say. Go get 'em! Do it! So you've even considered how
the squad will develop? That's right. Without a doubt… Obito was desperate for Rin
to acknowledge him. But… I understand your logic
behind this Lord Third. But…I failed twice with squads
that you organized. I don't think I'm cut out
to be a jonin leader. Did you fail them because of
your own personal feelings? No… It was unfortunate for them. But this is the strict world of shinobi. It's better that they learn this
when they're young. Ultimately, this will prove to be
a valuable lesson for them. But it wasn't planned.
It just happened to work out. Perhaps. But I had faith that
it would work out. I trusted you. Lord Hiruzen… It was the same with Minato too. Minato Sensei? Judging from only
the practice reports, it would seem that
Kakashi acted arbitrarily. Kakashi is leagues ahead
of the other graduates in terms of skill and intelligence. It's exciting just thinking about
this genin's development. Perhaps due to the incident
with Sakumo, he's very headstrong. But I have faith that he'll realize
the importance of teamwork. Faith, huh? Yes, you're right. I shall have faith in your faith. Minato Sensei knew all along about my selfish and
shallow strategy. But he had faith that one day,
I would realize it... To believe in one's student
and to watch over them… is also part of being a teacher. Father... I spent my life denying you… I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero. Sure, in the world of Ninja, one who breaks the rules and
regulations is regarded as trash. But…those who abandon their comrades
are worse than trash! But… I can't repeat that tragedy again
with a new generation. Are you going to be our Sensei? I'm Naruto Uzumaki! And I'm going to be the Hokage! Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,
Ino Yamanaka! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! I'm the jonin leader of
your squad, Asuma Sarutobi. We're going to have a meeting now. Follow me. See ya! So long! See you again, Sasuke! Get lost, Ino Pig! What? He's their sensei? Well, the next one will be ours! Nope, it'll be our sensei next! Right, Akamaru? Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame,
Hinata Hyuga… I'm Yuhi Kurenai and
I'll be your leader. Nice to meet you all. The loser squad gets
a loser sensei too! - He's late!
- He's late! Have you been waiting for me, Tenzo? Stop calling me "Tenzo," Senpai. Then drop the "senpai." You'll always be my senpai. That will never change,
even if you're no longer ANBU. So what do you want? I've heard the rumors that it's been very difficult
trying find my replacement. Or did you come all this way
to laugh at me, the genin babysitter? Not at all! But that was such a long time ago. You haven't changed a bit, Senpai. Sorry, but I'm busy today. I can't stand around and chat. It's way past the time you were
supposed to meet your genin. Well, see you later. "See you later," huh?
Maybe he did change a little. For someone who was fixated
on the past and present... to hear him say,
"see you later..." A silly prank… Still, if this prank was
the result of teamwork… He fell for it! So Naruto's the perp. I'm so sorry, Sensei.
I tried to stop him, but Naruto… Sakura makes excuses and
tries to protect herself… Sasuke minds his own business… He probably doesn't consider them
as comrades. There's not even a shred of teamwork… There are two bells here. Your task is to take these bells away
from me by noon. The one who fails to take
a bell gets no lunch. This exercise is to try
to split the team. I hope you figure it out. And failing the exercise means
failing the mission. In order words, at the very least, one of you will be returning
to the Academy. Let's get started. Ready… Start! Considering the prank
in the classroom… I doubt if they'll work
as a team to attack me. I knew it. Well, guys! I'm going to give you
one more chance. However, the afternoon scramble
for the bells will be much more difficult. If you accept the challenge,
eat your lunch. However, don't let Naruto eat. Huh? That's your punishment
for breaking the rule and attempting to eat lunch alone. If you give Naruto any food, you will be
immediately disqualified. I am the law here. Understand? Minato Sensei had faith in me… So should I have faith in them too? But what if I'm wrong
to begin with? Don't you have any kindness
in your heart? All you ever think about are
rules, rules, rules! It's annoying! That's right. I'm still trying to stick to my rules… Come on, let's go, Captain. Obito… For the sake of the team,
you walked over to me that day… If only I had accepted
the friendship you extended… If I had embraced
that little sign you gave me… Here. Obito, did you see that? I'll never forget you or Rin. Kakashi. Kakashi. Kakashi. You! Pass. But I think I'm going to move forward
with some new comrades. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura… I'm going to believe in you. And Obito, Rin…
I'll make a promise. I'll believe in my comrades
and I'll never let them die! That ends the survival exercise.
You all pass. Squad Seven will start
its mission tomorrow! Huh?! Hey, untie me! I couldn't keep my promise
to you.

 I'm trash. But you're a hero
of the Leaf.

 You don't have
to become trash too!

 Obito, your once strong will
is still alive today, right next to me!

 What the current me can do is...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kakashi's Resolve."

 ...protect the current Naruto!

 KAKASHI'S RESOLVE


 Tune in again!

 Dead men shouldn't go around
messing things up! Uchiha Reflection. I'll get the Eight and Nine Tails. Obito, you take down those two. - What?!
- You're not getting away! Obito... What happened to you? Why would you join up with him? Summoning Jutsu! You're late, Obito! You're finally here... You must be Obito. We've been waiting for you. Barely made it... You're really late. We've already introduced ourselves. You're the only one left! I'm going to be the Hokage! My name's Obito Uchiha! For my Great Stone Face, make sure my trademark goggles
and Sharingan are nicely carved out! So I can glare over
the neighboring lands! I'll scare the hell out of them
with my Sharingan stare... and no one will dare
attack our village! Rattle off your instructions
after you become the Hokage and activate your Sharingan. Besides, how can they carve
the Sharingan if you're wearing goggles? They can carve it out
over my goggles! Then it will look like your eyeballs
are popping out. Anyway...I'm happy that
someone on this team shares my dream. I'm Minato. From today,
I'll be your superior. I'm glad to meet you! Yeah! Minato Sensei... All of this... This world... - None of it matters anymore!
- None of it matters anymore! I'm not gonna let
that happen, idiot! I'm the son of
the Fourth Hokage, you know! I'm not gonna fall for your talk! I see. I was going easy on you because you were
the actual Jinchuriki, not a clone. but if that's how you feel,
I won't hold back on you! This is Hashirama's wooden dragon, which he used to hold down
my Nine Tails long ago. Madara really is crazy powerful. That's what makes him
worth fighting. Your tough guy act is crazy solid. I'm not going to hold back
against a zombie either! Since you're already dead! Why?! Why ally yourself with someone
like Madara? I've got nothing to say to you. All that's left... is this final battle! Kakashi's Resolve


 Earth Style... Mud Wall! Why? How about shutting up already? You're only talk.
You're nothing but a piece of trash. I believe that the White Fang
was a true hero. Sure, in the world of Ninja, one who breaks
the rules and regulations is regarded as trash. But those who abandon
their comrades... are worse than trash! This is probably... because you let Rin die. I am trash for sure... But Obito, you've always... Kamui... ...been my hero. So why? Damn it! That damned wooden thing! It's absorbing
the Nine Tails' chakra! Damn it... We have the same eyes... So you made it out, huh? Obito, how did you end up like this? Does it have to do with Rin? I'll protect my comrades! Let's go rescue Rin right now! Yeah! I said, trash should keep
their mouths shut! Die. I...couldn't keep
my promise to you. You're right. I'm trash. But you... You're a hero of the Leaf. There's no reason for you
to become trash too. This is reality. Those who bequeath
and the bequeathed...both. All shinobi who survive
in this world become trash. You and I are prime examples, Kakashi. Kakashi Sensei... I can't move... These guys are a distraction
for you too, right? This world is about
to come to an end. So in order to enjoy
the little time we've got left... Let's clear out this battlefield first. No one can escape the cycle
that gives birth to trash in this world. That's why I intend
to remake the world! You guys make me so mad,
I can't even think straight. So instead, let me tell you
something about myself. I'm not trash! I'm not planning on
becoming trash either! I will... stop you! - I'll never let my comrades die!
- I'll never let my comrades die! I'll never let my comrades die! I'm sorry, Naruto. I'm the one who taught you
Obito's words, and yet... I was about to waver again. Hirudora! Lightning Blade! Guess it wasn't just a bluff. Obito... Your once strong will
is still alive today... Right next to me! What the current me can do
is protect the current Naruto! You'll protect the current Naruto? Same here... They're both at their limits! These Hidden Leaf guys
sure love to act tough! The wood's constriction
is weakening. Octopops! Ow oww! Be careful, Naruto! The enemy's Wood Paralysis is identical
to the First Hokage's! It has the power to
bind Tailed Beast Power! Like Captain Yamato's technique... A Lightning Blade that relies
on the Sharingan... You've mastered your left eye... Even awakening the Mangekyo. But can you make it back
from the other plane in your current condition? Go back to the trash heap, Kakashi! Kakashi Sensei... is just like...me! Looks like we're gonna have to
start worrying about Ten Tails. Let them handle Obito. Then we'll make our move! Now I see it clearly... your pained face. Save those lines for
the one right next to you. I definitely have to help
Kakashi Sensei somehow. He's completely drained from
overusing the Sharingan. If he gets sucked in... Naruto, switch with me... Huh? Let me handle this. But... Don't argue. Just switch! Hey, Kakashi brat,
give me your hands... You're... Never mind that!
Just stick out your hands! Kurama! What the heck
did you just do? Now you don't have any distractions. I'm leaving the rest to you, Naruto. What?! Damn! Now that we know how
your ability works, I can counter it. Here's another! Oh yeah, that certainly
is a pained face Obito. What's going on? Kakashi did that. Over there. The difference between
you and me is... I can give or take chakra
voluntarily at will. I'll show you how it's done later. When did you pass it to him? When I grabbed his hand
to throw him. So then...! Yeah, whenever he wants to, he can use Kamui to come out. Kakashi Sensei! Thank Nine Tails for me. Sure! Let's blast him to bits
before he revives! Put in everything you've got! Right! It's ready to go,
Octopops and Eight-o! Okay! Fire! It's over now! The Statue's chakra...is gone. We did it. We did it, fool! Ya fool! All right then! It's over? Yeah...for this world. Now then... Shall we get started? Here comes a big one,
you think we can really do this?




 First, we keep our distance
and see what move he makes.




 Then we'll counter the attack
and hit him




 with a big blow
as close as we can get.




 Nine Tails, you're acting
like a captain.




 So? You got a problem with that?




 Nope. In fact I feel kinda happy!




 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu"




 Save that line for after we've won!





 THE ALLIED SHINOBI FORCES JUTSU





 Tune in again!





 The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu

 I-Is that...?! That's the...! There's no mistaking it. Yeah… That's… The Ten Tails! But I thought the Statue's evil chakra
had disappeared! Damn it! They got us! That thing doesn't have
that kind of emotion of feeling! It can't be sensed. It's Natural Energy itself. It's the same as that which
circulates around the world, that you can feel in
the soil, water, and the air. It would be a different story
if you tried it while engaged in Sage Mode though. Got it! So if you say he's all Nature Energy, then I can check him out! Forget it, Naruto… Even if you tried something like that… All you'll see is just
how immeasurable it is. You're not kidding. I had planned to capture them
before the Ten Tails revived, but... They're pretty good. I want to start the Infinite Tsukuyomi
ritual immediately. That Great Genjutsu requires time
to summon the moon. They will interfere with the jutsu. Things will go more smoothly if we use the Statue's power
to get rid of them first. Don't you agree? Madara… You just want to test
the Ten Tails' power, don't you? That's why you deliberately... You're like a child. No. Brats are impatient, touchy fools. Hey… Here comes a big one. You think we can really do this? Don't think you can hide
under your tentacles 'cuz you're scared! But first, hand me Guy over there. I'll heal him later. And that Naruto and Kakashi too! Yeah! Here you go! Listen up. First, we keep our distance
and see what move he makes! Then we'll counter the attack and hit him with a big blow
as close as we can get. Just like I said earlier! Nine Tails,
you're acting like a captain. Huh? You got a problem with that?! Nope… In fact, I feel kind of happy! That line... Save it for after we've won! Let's go! It's surprisingly fast… There wasn't any time to
observe its moves! Damn it! Now! Eight-O! Tailed Beast... Bomb Barrage! There's no need to dodge. I want to preserve Ten Tails' power
as much as possible. This is… …not good! It's all on you now! Persistent lot! Hey, Naruto, don't tell me... Don't worry Bushier Brow Sensei. Nice control, Naruto! You got them in nice and close! We focused too much on Ten Tails. Sorry about the one leg. But here we go! Kamui! Yeah! It just looks like one octopus leg
got left behind, but... Bee! Eight Tails! Operation Octopus Pot!
Sorry it's a mean and cowardly plot! I'm gonna smash this
into his eyeball! Get him! Huh?! There are two flies above us as well… The Ten Tails' tail?! Naruto! Kakashi! Naruto, you really are
a lot like me. That's right,
you're just younger than me. Eventually… Forgive me, Eight-O and Octopops! Another Shadow Clone, huh? Kurama! How can you fall apart
at a time like this?! That was about eight minutes. It's longer than before,
but that's the limit. I'm going to have to infuse
and build up my chakra. Guess we have no choice. That hurts, fool. Ya fool! Bee! I'm going to rest a bit too.
I'm also at my limit. I can't get healed yet? Pulling something as massive
as Eight Tails in and out sure comes with
a correspondingly large cost. I'm drained already. Seems Eight Tails and Nine Tails
have run out of chakra for now. You favorite Shadow Clone Jutsu? It may be forbidden high-level ninjutsu, but just increasing
the number of losers won't-- I'm not a loser! Stop, Naruto! It's meaningless to
create Shadow Clones that will divide your chakra
even more. They might be useful as diversions,
but not for decisive hits. And if you go down... we lose this war. You were always just
a motley crew anyway. Huh?! M-M-Motley crew? Like I said, you're incompetent. He's saying that it's pointless to
merely increase the number of heads... if they're all empty. You and I are both powerless shinobi. You... no, I should say everyone… will eventually end up like me. I'll never end up like you! How many times
do I have to tell you?! My dream is to become the Hokage! Don't worry. Everything will go as planned. There is no shinobi jutsu mightier
than the Infinite Tsukuyomi. I'll make you Hokage inside this jutsu. So… Just disappear along
with the rest of this world! What the…? Did it miss? On purpose? About time! Kakashi! Guy! Sorry to keep you waiting! I can't believe he shook off my Byakugan-aided, spot-on Mind Transfer
in just two seconds! But you still succeeded in shifting
that large thing's aim off target. Good work! Are you all right, Naruto? Yeah! You don't have to act tough
in front of Hinata, Naruto! Beetle Jamming Jutsu! Hidden Mist Jutsu! We're here, Naruto! All right, we won't be
so easily detectable now! Lord Bee! You're in better shape
than I expected! Lord Bee! You look seriously wounded! Omoi, you worry too much! Guy Sensei, don't tell me
you used Hirudora?! Lee! I'm sorry we're late, Captain Kakashi. Sakura, first off...! I know! The Sensory Water Sphere won't
maintain its original shape. We better...! Inoichi! Ao! Confirm the situation! - Roger!
- Okay! First Company has arrived! Second Company has also arrived! Third Company has arrived! Fourth Company has arrived! Fifth Company has also arrived! The Medical Unit's here too! Sensory Unit has arrived! Nice try hiding, but... Wind Style! Art of the Gust Blade! We're not a motley crew anymore! Here is the Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu! The world's greatest, most invincible,
super-duper ninjutsu, you know! A jutsu that trumps
the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Remember that! The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu, eh? Don't you think that's a bit of stretch? We're going to stop you two
with this jutsu! You're wrong. Why won't you realize that
it's meaningless for you to stop us here? After this war,
even that jutsu will disintegrate… Then someone from your side
will attempt to do exactly what we're doing now. There is no victory,
no matter how much you struggle. Get it through your head. There's no such thing as hope
anywhere in this world. I don't care! I'll make sure there's hope! It's meaningless to argue whether there is or isn't
something during a war. How about we settle this now? When there's a difference of opinion,
isn't the usual way majority rule? So what do we do? That's a good suggestion. Then… We'll call it after
we've erased all of you And... I knew you'd say that. But… This world… - will end!
- will not end! Let's go, everyone! This is the final deciding battle! Scatter! Thanks for buying us
some time, Naruto. Did you have enough time
to come up with a strategy? Thanks to you, I was able to
relay it to everyone! Kakashi told us the masked man
is Obito Uchiha. But there's no time to be shocked. For this fight, we need to take
and maintain the upper hand and not give them
any opportunity to counter! According to the intel we received,
our enemy has impressive eyes. First, we'll impede their movement
by destroying their vision. The Hidden Cloud! Lightning Style! Flash Pillar! Gale Style! Laser Circus. I see… Their true aim is to blind Ten Tails! With the two jutsu from earlier, the Hidden Mist's Mist
and the Beetle Jamming... Along with the large volume
of airborne dust stirred up by the Gale Style right now... The Hidden Sand, now! Wind Style: Air Current Dance! We'll not just destroy
their vision completely, but thwart them from
even sensing us at all. And since their sheer bulk
prevents them from hiding... we'll be able to take
full advantage of the situation. We only revealed our jutsu
to him a short while ago, and he's already incorporating them
into the battle plan! Leave it to Shikamaru's dad,
like father like son! This makes it impossible to sense them. We'll wipe them all out with
a Ten Tails' attack! The Hidden Stone,
proceed immediately! We know! Earth Style: Vast Mobile Core! After shutting down their senses,
we'll immobilize them! As soon as we bring down
the Ten Tails, pour in quicklime! - Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu!
- Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu! Hidden Mist! You're up next! - Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu!
- Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu! We'll add water to the mix, and rapidly stir up the quicklime! Hidden Leaf! Let's finish this! Sarutobi Clan members! Let's go! Fire Style: Majestic Flame Jutsu! And we'll dry it with the heat
from the Fire Style… Let it set and immobilize it! Unbelievable. Who would've thought, that the ninja from the five villages
could work so cooperatively. Unless we stop the Ten Tails, we don't have a chance
to go after Obito or Madara. The Ten Tails is merely a tool
for them to aid in activating their jutsu. If we cut off the head from the body,
namely those two… Infinite Tsukuyomi cannot
be activated! But keep in mind that
we won't be able to suppress the Ten Tails' power for too long. Only physical attacks work
on Madara. So shinobi who are skilled
in taijutsu will go after Madara! Obito can slip through
all moves and jutsu, but according to our intel,
that only lasts for five minutes. Coordinate with the Medical Unit and keep attacking him
for more than five minutes! Do not let up! That's right, Naruto... It's now time for your... Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu! How pitiful. Yeah. This hope that they're clinging to
doesn't exist. Just like their very lives,
at this point. It seems Ten Tails...is ready. Don't just stand there
spacing out, Naruto!




 This is a battlefield
and we're at war.




 People die!




 Naruto, your power is critical
to the plan.




 You are the key!




 So until we execute it...

 We must protect you, Naruto!




 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Ties That Bind"




 The Hyuga are the mightiest
among The Hidden Leaf!




 THE TIES THAT BIND





 Tune in again!





 The Ties that Bind


 This is the Allied
Shinobi Forces Jutsu! How pitiful. Yeah. This hope that they're all
clinging to doesn't exist. Just like their very lives,
at this point. It seems Ten Tails is ready. Fifth Gate of Closing! Open! So this time, they're coming
after us, not Ten Tails... Well... Taking the enemy's brains
is a fundamental strategy... I'll follow the strategy and... take down those two,
who are the brains of the Ten Tails! For that to work... they would need to
stop the Ten Tails first! What?! I thought we had immobilized
the Ten Tails! Are you okay?! Damn it... My shoulder's dislocated... Look at the Sensing Water Sphere... It's practically like a small planet. But that's...impossible! So we didn't immobilize
Ten Tails, after all? It merely stopped moving on its own in order to amass power
and undergo transformation? How are we going to be able to stop it? And now we can't target those two either! But we have to stop that thing
or else it's over for us. I'm about to pee myself... Instead of freaking out,
infuse your chakra! Be ready to move as soon as
we get the plan from HQ! We must immobilize Ten Tails... or else we can't go after
the brains that are controlling it... But how? Even with the jutsu of my clan
who specialize in immobilizing... the effect would be miniscule compared
to the amount of chakra expended. Inoichi! Link me to Kakashi! Roger! Kakashi, it's me! There's something
I want to confirm regarding the intel from
the last battle sequence... It's going to start getting more difficult
to control Ten Tails soon... Reinforce your bond with it
using Hashirama's cells. Don't you want to check out
Ten Tails' power in its current state? First, let's... Yes, let's show them... ...despair! Shikaku, I'm going to
let you go for now! What's the matter?! This is... No way! Lord Shikaku! Lord Inoichi! My Kamui won't make it in time! Displace it upwards using
an Earth Style technique. Right! That far away? It's so much greater than
all the previous Tailed Beasts! What power! It's wobbly from just that little counter... Its control isn't perfect yet. Next! Unbelievable! Such a far-off city
destroyed in an instant! It's been acting strange for a while,
it seems to be aiming far away! So all the cities,
and people are within its range of fire? Then that means
the evacuated Feudal Lords, everyone protecting the villages... plus all the citizens of
each nation aren't safe? Our shinobi on the battlefield are
fighting to protect everyone else... Those two are trying to eliminate
our reason for this war. That's the direction of--! Th-This is... What's wrong, Lord Ao?! Please listen to me calmly. Here, eh? Well, Shikaku... What do we do? Just keep doing what we must do. It will be our last act. Put me through to
everyone on the battlefield. I have a plan to stop the Ten Tails! Finally got them. We've now smashed
the brains of the Allied Forces. Like I said before,
it's fundamental strategy. Shikamaru... We're in the middle of a war. Don't waste any words on me. Or on Ino. Like Dad said, we just have
to do what we have to do. Wait... What exactly just happened?! You are the key to our plan. Not about that! I'm asking what happened to
Shikaku and Inoichi?! Neji! Rotate clockwise! Got it! - Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!
- Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! A-Amazing... Don't just stand there
spacing out, Naruto! This is a battlefield
and we're in a war. People will die! But if we are defeated
and lose this war... everyone will die! Of course I know that! Shikamaru and Ino's father
would likely say, that as shinobi, they're glad to have died
before their children. Just as my father did. Naruto, your power is critical
to the plan. So until we execute it... We must protect you, Naruto! Hinata! Know this! The Hyuga are the mightiest
among the Hidden Leaf! There he goes...
I was hoping to take them down before they started
with the speeches, but... It's hard to control Ten Tails well. This ought to do until
the next transformation, but... Afterwards... I suspect only a Jinchuriki will
be able to control it. Though for me to become
the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki... I'll need to be fully alive, not hosted within a corpse
as a Reanimation. Reanimations like you are perfect
for large-scale suicidal attacks. But the reason
you haven't launched the Ten Tails Tailed Beast Bomb
at them, blowing yourself up as well, is because I'd get caught up
in it and die too. And the reason that
would be a problem, is because in order for you to
truly be brought back to life and become a Jinchuriki... you need me to sacrifice myself and perform the Gedo Art of
Rinne Rebirth on you. In short, you're in
a delicate position right now where you're entirely at my mercy. Don't forget that. Well, well, that rug rat sure
has become the wily fox. I never considered you a friend. Fine then. You decide our next move then. We continue. They will know despair...thoroughly. Wood Style! Cutting Sprigs! There's so many of them! Just try to evade them. My Mountain Jutsu should
at least slow it down until Nine Tails' strength returns. Except I need some time
to build up enough chakra! Hold on, everybody! Cha! So many! My Rotation can't keep up! Thanks, Neji! I can activate Sage Mode now! I can't keep relying on you geniuses! Now it's my turn! Rasen Shuriken! Here's a few more! Eight Trigrams: Air Wall Palm! Damn it! A focused attack! There's too many! Hinata and Neji's Air Palms
won't be sufficient... Byakugan! Earth Style! Mountain Jutsu! Medical Team! Where are you?!
There's a critical injury here! Hurry! No... I'm no longer... Neji... Brother... Naruto... Lady Hinata... is willing to die for you. So...you hold more... than one...life in your hands... And it seems...that my life too...
may have been... one of them.... Why? Why did you do this here? You were going to change
the Hyuga! Long ago, those words of yours,
freed me from the shackles of fate. Why would you go so far for me? Even give up your life... Because...you called me a genius... Unlike me, you're not a failure! Father... I finally understand...
the freedom you felt... choosing to die in order
to protect your comrades. Didn't you say you wouldn't
let your friends die...? Naruto! I'll never let my comrades die! Those words...
"I'll never let my comrades die." Now look around you...
and say it again! I told you to say it again! As the bodies of your comrades
grow cold in your arms... take in their deaths! Neji's...dead?! Hizashi, forgive me... I let Neji--! This will continue... And your flippant words and
ideology shall become lies. This is the end result of
hope and ideals. This is reality! Naruto... What is there for you in this reality? Your mother and father are gone,
as well as your master, Jiraiya. And if you keep standing against us, you'll continue to lose
your friends one by one. This shall become a world where no one who
acknowledges you will exist. Obito... The only thing that awaits you... is your worst nightmare,
which you know quite well! Solitude! You've become exactly
like the old me, Obito. Naruto will give up shortly... Which will break the will
of the Allied Forces. Why must you cling to reality? Enough of this...
Now come join us, Naruto! Brother Neji just said, that you hold more than
one life in your hands. Do you know what he meant? "I'll never let my comrades die." Neither those words nor
the conviction behind them are lies! Because he was able to successfully
store them in his heart, and live them out to until the end! Brother Neji did! It's not just you, Naruto... We all hold those words
and feelings in our hearts. They're what bind our lives together... and make us comrades. If we all give up and
discard those words and feelings, Neji's final act will have been
for nothing. And that is when...
your comrades truly die! For you are then
no longer comrades. That's...how I feel. So, stand with me, Naruto. Because never going back
on one's word... is my Ninja Way too! Naruto... Lady Hinata...
is willing to die for you. So...you hold more... ...than one life! Don't forget about me! I know. I take my bonds seriously! I'd never abandon my comrades! But in reality, Neji is... Stop your rambling! I'll beat you up and take over
your body for good this time! And did you also forget? Your mother and father did
the same thing Neji did just after you were born. They sealed me,
their archenemy inside you, and entrusted the future
to you and died. Your life was already linked to
two others from the time you were born! Will he just stand back and
see how Naruto responds...? It seems Naruto makes him uneasy. Enough! Don't be hasty! You're going to harm yourself
as well as Ten Tails! I don't care! Ten Tails hide is tough! They're going to hit us! Recharging completed! Be careful, Lord Bee! Go get 'em! Take this! Lord Bee! Don't go overboard! There's no need to worry... Protecting the Alliance is my territory! That's right. It wasn't just Mom and Dad. Yeah... It hasn't just been my life... up until now. Thanks, Hinata! It's all thanks to you
standing by my side. And Neji... Thank you. Naruto's hand is so big... and strong, but most of all... Let's do this, Hinata! Yeah! It's comforting! I haven't been able to save
many comrades...





 An existence where one can only
await one's death inside a cage...




 It's a nice analogy.




 You're all exactly like that brat who
just died a pointless death.




 Neji's will isn't dead yet!




 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Those Who Dance in the Shadows."




 THOSE WHO DANCE IN THE SHADOWS






 Tune in again!


 Those Who Dance in the Shadows


 What is this chakra? They all sense the chakra, even though none of them
are sensory types. This chakra is... Let's go. Hurry and
lead the way, Orochimaru. It looks like he's a bit concerned... about Naruto. That's Nine Tails'—
I mean, Naruto's chakra! Nice work transforming and
transferring my chakra, Naruto! I've gotten the hang of it.
Work with me, Kurama! That shinobi Nara, he sure analyzed my chakra
exchange capabilities extensively. We've kept them waiting a while. A few shadow clones should be okay. Got it! A-Amazing... Naruto is able
to use this chakra... Shadow Clone Jutsu! You're late, Naruto! Sorry! Choji! Ino! O-Okay! What...is this? Are these calories? Hey! Choji! You're gaining weight again! That brat Naruto... Is he giving
them the Nine Tails' chakra? 8 Trigrams Air Palm! I feel...my power surging! She did that with just an Air Palm?! That girl... She's gotten quite strong after
getting power from Naruto... Expansion Jutsu! Shikamaru! Ino! Are you ready?! - Yeah!
- Okay! You all understand the plan, right?
Beat it into your heads! Start with Ino-Shika-Cho! What if the plan doesn't work? Then you live on and
take the reins, Shikamaru. HQ will be wiped out shortly. The only face time I spent with you
as your father was when we played shogi. I haven't given you a thing-- You gave me plenty. I was able to grow up,
staring at your back, Dad. Ino... You've grown up to become
the embodiment of the Yamanaka clan's purple crest,
the bush clover, and what it symbolizes... Optimistic love...right? That's not the only thing
the bush clover stands for. The thing I am most proud of
is your care and compassion... for your friends! I've watched you blossom into
a beautiful bush clover flower... Our time's almost up. Do you have any final words, Shikaku? Hmm... Could you tell your mom
this for me, Shikamaru... Wait! Before that, throw out
that thing in the wooden box on the left-hand shelf
of the storeroom without your mom finding out! I know all about it... Don't worry... Lastly, from me... Never forget that we live on
inside of you forever. Don't forget! Don't mock me! What?! - Shadow Possession...
- Mind Transfer... - Jutsu!
- Jutsu! I'm in! Tsk... They did it again! Damn you! They're faster than me! Nice, Ino! They just keep on coming... Now it's the Nara's Paralysis jutsu... - Don't mess with the Nara Clan!
- Don't mess with the Nara Clan! All right! We stopped him
in his tracks! You can stop now, Ino! Are you all right?! Y-Yeah... Neji! Lee, stop crying! Lee... Lee... So long as we don't abandon
Neji's convictions, he will continue to live on,
connected inside all of us. Let me share a little something
with you. It's those connections that
made me what I am today! You ought to know that bonds
can be powerful curses too! Naruto... I was the one who once told you, "I will never let my comrades die..." Those words are also
an admonition aimed at myself. I haven't been able to save
many comrades. Which is why I keep telling
myself this time, I will protect them. But then, I end up having to face
the fact that I couldn't once more. I'll be confronting those wounds...
for the rest of my life. But that's why we're ninja. We are those who endure. They'll never let you forget. But it's those wounds that prove
your comrades live on inside here. Your friends are still alive
in here... Friends that you create
inside a dream, so you can't get hurt,
aren't real. That means you're just erasing
your real friends! Curse or not, I want to keep
the real Neji right here. The real Neji...right here... Gentle Fist! It's no use, Lee. No matter how hard you try,
you'll never defeat me. That's just how things are. Look for a different rival. So you saw me lose. Hey, Lee, I used to think that you couldn't change the fate
that was handed to you... One day, I'll fight you for real,
so we can see which is greater, your Ferocious Fist
or my Gentle Fist. But...I shall not lose so long
as my eyes are black. In your case, Neji, isn't it
the white of your eyes? Oh... Yeah... But anyway...
You have me as your rival. It's a lot stronger than before,
and more of it than last time. There's something I want to confirm regarding the intel from
the last battle sequence... Kakashi, you said that
the reason why you were able to travel
through space time using Kamui, plus pull Eight Tails
in and out almost whole, was thanks to receiving
Nine Tails' chakra from Naruto, right? Yes ... To be more precise, I received that chakra
directly from Nine Tails... In reference to your choice
of words, "Thanks to..." How different was it compared to using Kamui
without Nine Tails' chakra? Explain it to me in simple terms. I would say more than
three times the power. I couldn't really hurl things
that were very large or do it very often before that. Almost done? Humph... Looks like things
have gone your way, Fourth Hokage! NARUTO     NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
Until now, the only one who was
able to link their chakra to mine NARUTO     NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
was Naruto because
he possesses Kushina's NARUTO     NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
and because he has been
my Jinchuriki for many years... NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA
And Naruto has matured
to the point NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA
where he's skillful enough to sense
and transmute my chakra NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA
to be compatible with other shinobi
and then hand it over to them. NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA  NINJA
Though I can also help
or use Naruto NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA  NINJA
as an intermediary
to give my chakra to anyone... NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA  NINJA  NINJA
The same exact way
you handed over NINE TAILS' CHAKRA
NARUTO
NINJA  NINJA  NINJA  NINJA
and inserted your own chakra
into Naruto, Minato. He's already... Surpassed you both
a while ago now. The amount of chakra
he's linking and delivering is on a completely
different scale! Kushina, Minato...
You're pathetic! You both pale in comparison
to your brat Naruto! But this is probably... the power you wanted
to give to Naruto. Heh... I should probably lend
a little more power too. Damn it!
He's pushing me back hard! Naruto, now's your chance!
Do it now! Tailed Beast Bomb! Beam of Light. - Eight Trigrams Wall of Air Palm!
- Eight Trigrams Wall of Air Palm! - Wind Style: Giant Casting Net!
- Wind Style: Giant Casting Net! I won't let Neji's death
be in vain! A curse mark that doesn't
go away until you die... A shinobi curse that Hyuga's main
and branch families gave rise to... An existence where one can
only await one's death inside a cage. It's a nice analogy for
our current situation. You're all exactly like that brat
who just died a pointless death. Neji... Neji's will... isn't... dead yet! I'll take the right! Gotcha! Damn it! My shoulder's dislocated again! Gentle Fist! Go, Lee! All right! Unlike you guys, I don't want... to sever any of my bonds...
or get them cut off! So this is it... This place seems to be untouched. It's in shambles. Well, I suppose it is way outside
the village. Which one is it? Let's see, it should be
around here somewhere. There it is. This place gives me the creeps... If we've found what
we were looking for, let's get out of here! Yes, let's go... to where all the secrets sleep. Huh? This place sure has changed a lot too. What's up with Sasuke? He's just like how I was before
I wanted to destroy Leaf. How so? Even if both he and the village
have changed, this place is still his homeland. He needs some time to reaffirm
his decision and resolve, through immersing himself in sentimentality
and by retracing the past. Hmm... So you're over it already? The whole immerse yourself
in sentimentality to affirm your resolve
to destroy the Leaf thing. Hey, come to think of it, we were all your cream of
the crop subordinates, right? And now...
we're inside of the Leaf... All the strong ones are gone
because they're away fighting. Isn't this a perfect opportunity for you? Perhaps, indeed... Except for one thing... You're no longer Hebi. Oh, you use a jutsu to remove
the entry stone... There's not even a trace of
the Uchiha's Nakano Shrine... The exterior doesn't matter.
What's important is what's beneath. Let's go. Well then, I'm going to get started. It's best if you stand back. In order to perform
what is written in the scroll, first, the Death God's Mask
is necessary. That is located in
the Uzumaki Clan's Noh Mask Hall on the outskirts of the Leaf Village. Then one must allow the Death God
of the Reaper Death Seal to possess oneself and
guide it forth. Slice open the Death God's abdomen
and the seal will come undone. Though I shall then end up
a human sacrifice. However, it will also allow me
to get back both of my arms from inside
the Death God's belly. They're mine again! And if I can regain the power
that lies in those arms, I can perform the Reanimation. That's right... I can revive those four. Of course in that case, you're well aware of what will
then become necessary... You're planning on using us as sacrifices
for the Reanimation, aren't you?! That's not such a bad idea, but we've actually got something
even better than you guys. Though it's still invisible
to you yet. Jugo, Sasuke, Suigetsu...
Get ready! Got it. Jugo, bestow upon Sasuke some
of your Curse Mark Sage Power. And when you do, the Zetsu that
Tobi stuck onto Sasuke to watch him should respond and
rise to the surface. Damn it! How did you--?! I know your Hashirama cells inside
and out from my experiments. Including how to detect you,
of course. Six of you, huh? Tobi sure
wasn't taking any chances! When I reclaimed and
reabsorbed my chakra from Kabuto, all his intel was transferred
inside me. And he'd thoroughly
investigated the six Zetsu that had been attached to Sasuke. I possess those four's DNA as well, since I love collecting and
storing knowledge too. Suigetsu, Jugo...
Take care of the remaining two. Okay, Lord Orochimaru! Reanimation Jutsu! Now, here I come! They, who are all-knowing... The previous Hokage! That's the First Hokage?




 The real Hashirama who's been
touted as a God of Shinobi?




 No way...




 You solved how to undo
that Sealing Jutsu?




 Lord First, it appears we've been
recalled into the world of the living.




 Hm? Who the hell are you?




 Oh, uh... The Fourth Hokage, sir!




 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The All-Knowing"




 Oh! The Fourth, eh?!





 THE ALL-KNOWING





 Tune in again!





 The All-Knowing

 That's the First Hokage?

 The real Hashirama who's been
touted as a God of Shinobi? Don't tell me it's that
shinobi Orochimaru again! What do you mean? I suspect he undid
the Reaper Deal that has been keeping us
sealed away. And then performed
the Reanimation Jutsu. No way... You found out how to undo
that Sealing Jutsu? How did you do
that Mr. Orochimaru? You underestimate me, Minato. Originally a Sealing Jutsu
of the Uzumaki Clan... I've been researching the ruins
and scattered documents of the now extinct clan
ever since I lost my jutsu. Lord First... It appears we've been recalled
into the world of the living. Who the hell are you?! Oh, uh... The Fourth Hokage, sir. Oh? The Fourth Hokage,
you say? I see! So the village has
remained stable! Well, I'm not actually sure
if it has or not. Because I died and was sealed away
much earlier than Lord Third. Huh? Is that so... In a separate incident than when
I was sealed away with Sarutobi? Yes...
a completely separate incident. So who's the Fifth Hokage? Your granddaughter,
Princess Tsunade. Tsuna, huh? Is the village okay? Is there something to be
worried about? She was my first grandchild,
so I spoiled her rotten! In the end, she even picked up
my gambling habit... He's not what I expected of someone considered to be
the God of Shinobi! How do I put it? The Reanimation Jutsu again... I can't believe the jutsu I devised
would be used so casually. It's not a complex jutsu. However, you should not have
created it in the first place. Lord Second... Many of your policies and jutsu
that you developed ended up causing problems
later on down the line. Even now... Why you! Are you planning on attacking
the Leaf again?! I took away your jutsu
in exchange for my own life. Yet you still--! And this time you revived me,
your former master, to pit me against the Leaf! Conflict, no matter what the era. It certainly cannot be called
that great a jutsu. Tobirama, that's why I told you
that time to... Will you be quiet, big brother? I am trying to talk to
this stripling right now. But I... Shut up! So not dignified for
the God of Shinobi! Please do not misunderstand. I don't have any more leanings
in that direction. Haven't you noticed that I'm not
suppressing your personalities? There are certain circumstances
at play this time. I'm merely creating a stage for
discourse per his strong desire. I'm Sasuke Uchiha and I want to
ask you Hokage some things. Is that you Sasuke? You belong to the Uchiha? Of course you'd stick with
a scoundrel. Tobirama! I told you to stop
saying such things! You're too soft, big brother! Never mind me. Lord Third... Why did you make Itachi
do what he did? So, you've learned of
what happened. I...killed Itachi to avenge
the Uchiha Clan. Afterwards, I learned the truth
from Tobi and Danzo. And I leaned towards swearing
vengeance against the Leaf. However, I want to hear it
straight from your mouth. Everything regarding Itachi. So it came to that... Not only did I have him
kill his brethren... I also had him bear
the false charge of traitor... and keep tabs on the Akatsuki
all by himself. From the time he was
a small child, Itachi paid attention
to the teachings and signs of our predecessors that
no one else gave heed to. He was a sensitive child who understood our village's past
and our shinobi. And perhaps due to that, the trappings of a clan
never bound Itachi. He was able to think ahead
about the future of shinobi and of the village. And constantly had misgivings
regarding those futures. Even at the age of seven,
he thought like a Hokage. We left everything to Itachi
in his hands alone... and he executed
his missions perfectly. He killed his entire clan
and stopped a revolt. Prevented a coming war
all by himself. He even infiltrated the Akatsuki as
a spy to protect the village. On the condition that I protect you
within the village. So it's all true. This is part of
the Uchiha's cursed fate. I can't believe they're on
the brink of extinction. So they even plotted a coup... I'd envisioned that it might come
to something like that. The rebellious elements bearing
Madara's will had been smoldering. But you're the one who drove
the Uchiha to it, Lord Second... It could be said that
the seeds got sown with the Uchiha Police Force
that you created. What did you say? Those who crack down on crime
tend to be easily disliked. The more authority
such a group has, the more conceited it can get. By building the Police Station
next to the prison under the pretext of facilitating
the monitoring of criminals, you conspicuously shoved
the Uchiha Clan to the margins of the village. That's what fostered
the adherents to Madara. Tobirama! Did I not emphasize to you
over and over again not to slight the Uchiha? But I gave them positions that
they were eminently qualified for. And I believed that even if
another Madara were to emerge, he could be dealt with right away. As you well know, older brother,
the Uchiha are... ...a clan possessed by evil! It's like Madara left
a psychological scar upon you. To cause such fear of the Uchiha. You stripling.
You do not know Madara. Second Hokage,
a question for you... What is it about the Uchiha Clan?
What do you know? The Senju and Uchiha Clans share a long history
of battling each other. We were once bitter enemies. I know that already... What did you mean about
the Uchiha being possessed by evil? There used to be a thought that
in contrast to the Senju Clan, who based their strength in love
as opposed to jutsu... The basis of
the Uchiha Clan's strength was the power of their jutsu. However, the truth
is actually different. There is no clan that feels
deeper love than the Uchiha. And that is why the Uchiha have
suppressed and sealed it away. What do you mean?! Once a member of the Uchiha
knows love, it's almost as if all of his or her previously
checked emotions are released. They awaken
a profound love and power that exceeds even the Senju's. But why is that a problem? It should help things go smoothly
with the Senju too... This super-strong
power of love, right? Except it is quite problematic. This great power hides within it the possibility of
going out of control. When an Uchiha who has known
love loses that deep love, it is replaced by an even
stronger hate that changes them. I've seen it happen
quite a few times. And that's when
a special condition emerges. Condition? When an Uchiha writhes
in agony over the loss of a great love or disappointment
in themselves, a unique chakra is released
inside their brain and reacts with the optic nerves and
changes appear that person's eyes. The eyes that reflect the heart. This is what we call the Sharingan. The Sharingan taps into
the power of that person's heart, rapidly increasing their strength,
along with the power of their hate. There were many sensitive
individuals among the Uchiha, and nearly all who were
exposed to strong emotions were taken over by darkness
and fell to evil. The deeper the darkness gets the greater
the Visual Prowess becomes, until the person can
no longer be stopped. Just like Madara. Madara cared deeply
for his younger brother... His love was, perhaps, greater
than your brother's love for you. I thought I had arranged
and guided things as such that the Uchiha's power could
be harnessed to serve the village. Although if they self-destructed
for the sake of the village, then so be it. Either way, in the end, they were
of use to the Leaf Village. Tobirama! Stop talking like that! You are speaking to
an innocent Uchiha child! What is all-important
is the village. The village is the keystone. I know that you know
that too older brother. It doesn't bother me. I am neither innocent nor a child. It's not the standard pattern... It's the Mangekyo Sharingan... First Hokage... I ask you this... What does it mean to be a village? And what does it mean
to be a shinobi? What is a village,
and what are shinobi? My older brother Itachi, despite
having been used by the Leaf, defended the village with his life. He died a proud Leaf Shinobi. So what exactly is this village, that one strives to protect even
if it means killing one's kin? Even if it means their own death? And what are shinobi who've
created such circumstances and consider them acceptable? I'll listen to your response
and find out the truth, and then I'll make my decision... Whether or not to declare
vengeance against the Leaf. Or... Orochimaru... What is it? You once tried to
destroy the Leaf... At first, when you said you
did it on a whim, I believed you. But now, I know it was
something different. What was the real reason? Vengeance against the Hidden Leaf? You brat possessed
with the Uchiha evil! In that case I shall... Lord Second! Tobirama! Now we're talking presence! Lower your finger. All right... Don't get your chakra
so riled up, brother. Sorry about that! Wow, that's incredible! You haven't changed a bit,
Lord Hashirama... Well then, Sasuke,
you had a good older brother. He was a greater shinobi
than I ever was! I don't mind telling you more
about the village, but it will take a while. If possible, could you
please tell the child everything he wants
to know quickly? We don't have much time. No time? We're in the middle of a war. Madara Uchiha has been revived and apparently intends to erase
all the shinobi of this world. Always conflict,
no matter what the era. I definitely feel
some powerful chakra in the direction of 2 o'clock. This is Naruto and
Nine Tails' chakra. I see So you did it, Naruto! And you're fighting together...
even now! It seems to be true. I'm definitely sensing
Madara's chakra. Then we ought to head
to the battlefield. As all of you are under the control
of my Reanimation Jutsu, your movements can be restricted. If you insist, you may head to the battlefield
after we finish talking. Talk later! Do you truly understand the gravity of Madara
having been revived? I'm sticking with this child. If Sasuke isn't satisfied
with your explanation, I may use all of you to destroy
the Leaf now. The timing couldn't be better. This jutsu--! Orochimaru, was it? You seem to be
misunderstanding something. The fact that you've upped
the precision of the Reanimation since the last time shall
be your downfall. Now that we've been revived
at close to our original power... I am not someone who can be bound by the Reanimation of
one such as you. Do not forget, I am the one who devised
this jutsu in the first place. Older brother, you must agree
that we have no choice. I will take action! Sarutobi, you sure raised
quite a shinobi. It is an honor to be praised
by the God of Shinobi himself. He's acquired my cells and
enhanced his power to bind us! Tobirama...
Your instincts have dulled a bit. Damn him... Taking a closer look, most of his body is composed
of my older brother's cells... Now then... First Hokage Hashirama... He's different. He could undo my binding
at any time... I have to be careful not
to let down my guard. Orochimaru... Do not fret. My priority is to undo
the ill feelings that are binding this child. I don't know what he will decide
after he is done listening to me... But if we ignore him now, he will definitely become
the next Madara. If that happens, ending the war
and winning will be meaningless. Do as you please, older brother. Now then... Where should I start? Yes... In order to talk to you
about village and shinobi... Wood Style: Wood Dragon Jutsu! I must first speak of
the Uchiha and Senju Clans... Wood Style! Wood Golem Jutsu! The Wood Style Wood
Expulsion Jutsu, was it? Perfect for taking on
difficult beasts... He clad his Susano'o around
the Tailed Beast like armor! Madara, you crafty fox! I can read your sword swings! Wood Style:
Laughing Buddha Jutsu! At this rate, this land
will be completely obliterated. It's best to move this
to the seashore! You're not getting away! There, try grabbing that! What will you do now?! Summoning... Five-Layer Rashomon! This... will change the trajectory! All the way to the other shore? Hashirama... It's been a while since we've
fought each other earnestly! You can see that I have changed! You're going to
lay everything to waste? To all we've accomplished up
until now, Madara? Nothing will come of us
battling each other... This fight will only hurt
the village and shinobi! This is an insult towards
our siblings and our friends! You know nothing of my--! I don't want to kill you! Are you implying that
you could kill me at any time? No! I'm saying we're friends! I've already...reached it! Then so be it... Sage Art: Wood Style: Veritable 1000-Armed Kan'on Here I go, Madara! Bring it, Hashirama! Aim it a little higher
than you'd expect, and then...



 I know that!



 It will reach the other side
if I put my all into it!



 Besides who are you anyway?



 First name's Hashirama.
I can't tell you my last name.



 Hashirama, huh?



 That was...



 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hashirama and Madara"



 ...the first time I encountered
Madara Uchiha.





 HASHIRAMA AND MADARA





 Tune in again!


 This time, I'll reach
the other side for sure. Just aim it a little higher
than you'd expect. That's the trick. I don't need you to tell me that. It will reach the other side
if I put my all into it! Who the hell are you anyway? Right now, I'm just your rival
at stone skipping. Though mine has already
reached the other side. That was the first time
I encountered Madara Uchiha. Hashirama and Madara


 I asked you who you are! It's Hashirama. I can't tell you my last name
due to reasons... Hashirama, eh? Well, just watch.
I'm gonna make it this time. The way he throws… I'm sure…
It's the shuriken jutsu! Hey! You stood behind me
on purpose to distract me! I'm the type that can't even pee
when someone's standing behind me! S-Sorry! Hey… Don't take it so seriously… Sorry, I was just making excuses… I…I didn't know… That you had such an obnoxious
self-diagnosed neurosis... I can't tell if you're a nice guy
or a nasty guy! One thing for sure! I'm better
than you at stone skipping! Want me to skip you instead? S-Sorry… I didn't mean to upset you. To make amends,
I'll let you throw me into the river. Go ahead, throw me. Do you even notice
your own obnoxious neurosis? I just...hope I reach
the opposite shore... You're a real eyesore!
Get lost! Well then... Wait a second! Which is it?
Why don't you be more clear? Th-That's… That's…! Are you…a shinobi? This location will become
a battlefield soon. Go home. This is a Hagoromo Clan crest… Sorry, but I've got to go… So long… Uh… It's Madara. Madara… Not proffering one's family name
to a stranger... is shinobi law. I knew it… You're a shinobi too. Our personalities differed, and yet I sensed
a mysterious kinship with him. I felt I knew why he'd come down
to the river too. Kawarama... Shinobi do not cry! Shinobi are born into this world
to fight and die in battle. Be grateful that we have
even a piece of his corpse! For our enemy this time includes the Uchiha Clan
in addition to the Hagoromo Clan! They are particularly merciless! Kawarama was just seven years old! How long…will this kind
of fighting continue?! Until the very last foe
has been vanquished. The path to a battle-free world
is not easily made! And children must be sacrificed? I will not allow Kawarama
to be disrespected! He fought and died as
a full-fledged shinobi! He was not a child! Older brother Hashirama, are you okay? You know what happens
when we defy Father. I…don't want… either of you, Itama or Tobirama… to die in vain! The Senju, the clan of love? As if! A full-fledged shinobi, my butt! All of this is just grown-ups
driving kids to their deaths! We're doing exactly
the same thing as the Uchiha! That's how we honor our opponents. Even an infant wielding a weapon
is deemed an enemy. And to raise one's child to become
full-fledged is a parent's love! So in order to become full-fledged,
you have to die?! We kill and are killed so much, you can't even keep track
of all the grudges! And it's too risky to even divulge
our family names! There's something totally wrong
about a ninja world like this! Children like you are called brats! Father… Older Brother's feeling depressed today… So please forgive him. Hashirama, go and cool your head. Grown-ups are stupid. If they want to stop the fighting,
they should make a pact… But…what about avenging
our parents and brothers… and all our friends who were killed? Keeping saying stuff like that
and you'll end up dead too. You and the adults are both hotheaded. Sorry… Forthcoming shinobi must suppress
their emotions, create suitable rules that
they then follow and avoid extraneous conflict. Can't a true pact... an alliance be achieved? What's a true pact? During the Era of Warring States, the average life expectance
of both shinobi and citizens was around 30 years old. And the reason
the average was so low was... Itama! The deaths of many young children. Itama! Hey, long time no see! Umm… It's Hashirama. So, Hashirama…
You seem awfully down. What happened? What's with you! I'm fine! Liar… You can talk to me, you know. It's nothing… Come on, tell me. I said it's nothing. Hey, stop dragging this out!
I promise I'll listen! It's really nothing… Nothing at all. Out with it! What's the matter? My little brother…died. I come to the river because I feel like
all the haziness in my heart gets washed away as
I stare at the water. So that's what happened... Your name's Madara, right…? I wonder if you're like me… Do you have siblings? I'm one of five. Well, there used to be five of us. Used to? We're shinobi. We never know when
we're going to die. If there were a way where
neither side had to die... It would be where both sides
revealed their insides, and hid nothing from each other... And poured each other drinks
and drank together like brothers. But that's impossible... Because one can't look deep
into another's insides down to their guts. In reality, they could be as mad as hell. Isn't it possible… to really show how you feel
without showing your guts? I don't know… But every time I come here, I pray for some way
to make it happen. I finally got it to go
in the right direction. You're not the only one… Me too… It reached. In all honesty, I was shocked… That one person understood
how I felt despite all the people
that didn't. So there was another foolish kid,
who thought as I did, to try to change this war-torn era. Maybe shocked isn't the right word… To me, Madara was a gift
from the divine. In your case…I can tell without
looking into your insides that... What? That your hairdo and outfit
are totally lame! Not that we thought alike
in every respect... After that, we started
meeting up every now and then, still without knowing
each other's family names... We'd spar and
compare our shinobi moves or talk about the future… Taijutsu and kumite. Nice job pulling a draw against me! It's not a draw... I'm still standing. Huh? Ouch! What were you saying?
How's this not a draw? When did you…? I threw it the instant
you blew me away. I'm not gonna be
beaten that easily. But the question is, how do we change
things concretely? We've got to have
a vision for the future. The first steps are for us to
not give up on our ideals and to get a lot stronger. Weak pups barking
won't change a thing. Right. If we master all sorts
of jutsu and get stronger, the adults won't be able
to ignore our words anymore. We gotta master many jutsu
and cover any weaknesses. Well… I am stronger than most adults
around me already. No kidding? I'm impressed. You really can't, eh…? Stop standing behind me! I found your weakness… I'm gonna throw you into
the exact spot I pissed in! Take this! It's my Water Style! Disgusting! Don't whip it around! Each time we met,
we became closer friends. Madara… I came up with an amazing jutsu! Let's master it together! Really? Show me. A Secret Taijutsu Technique, a Super Fire Style Genjutsu Slice
Giant Shuriken Two-Step Drop Jutsu! Nope… I can't visualize it at all. I mean, which is it?
Taijutsu or genjutsu? In the first place,
the name is too long! Who can remember such
a long name? Well, let me explain it... Never mind! Today, I'm challenging you
to cliff climbing! Quit getting depressed
all the time! That's your weakness. And your weakness is
to judge too quickly… I'm just psyching you out…
before cliff climbing! Huh? Hey you! See you later! You were just pretending, huh?! I win… That's to be expected…
You started before me! What a sweeping view of the forest! Yeah, you can see really far! I know my eyesight's just
as good as yours. Want to challenge me? What makes you say
that all of a sudden? You sound really proud
of your eyes. Well sure! I have Sha… What's the matter? No…never mind.
I guess it's not all that. What is it? You're being awful
candid for once. If I were better,
my siblings wouldn't be dead. I couldn't even protect them. So I shouldn't...shouldn't... Madara… Sorry… I brought back some memories
for you too, huh. So…you don't have
any more siblings? No… I have
one younger brother left. And I'll protect him,
no matter what! What about you? I have one brother left too. And I intend to protect him too,
no matter what. I've decided!
Let's build our settlement here! Huh? And make it so kids won't
have to kill each other! We'll create a school where kids
can train and grow up stronger! Assign missions that fit an individual's abilities
and strengths! Have superiors who can properly
assign ranks to commissions! It will be a place where kids don't have to be sent
into harsh battlefronts. You're pretty much
the only one spouting nonsense. Well then, what about you? It doesn't sound bad at all. Then it's decided! Yeah… If that settlement
gets built here, then I could watch over
my little brother, and protect him in this place
where you can see to no end! That was where the Leaf Village
would eventually stand. I made a resolution that day. To endure for
the sake of my vision. We both made it. That stone…
is perfect for rock skipping. Hang on to it until
we meet next time! What is it, Tobirama? Older Brother… Come with me. Hashirama, this boy you've been
meeting up with... How did you…? Father ordered me to tail you… You? I have better sensory skills
than you. You've been going out
quite often lately, so I knew something was up. I checked up on that boy. He belongs to the Uchiha Clan. He has killed adults from our clan. It seems he was born
with inherent shinobi talent. So I was right… Given your lack of surprise... Don't tell me
the two of you already knew each other's clan names. No… I didn't know. He probably
doesn't know mine either. Hashirama. Do you know what this means? The Senju and Uchiha Clans
are bitter enemies. I haven't told anyone
in our clan yet… If we're not careful,
you could be branded a traitor. If you don't want to be accused
of being an enemy spy… after you see that boy next time,
follow him. And bring back intel
about the Uchiha Clan. This is a mission. If he should notice you... kill him! Maybe it just isn't possible for us
to reach that pipe dream of ours.




 Madara...you...




 It may have been brief,
but it was fun.




 Our next meeting will likely be
on the battlefield.




 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Era of Warring States"




 I truly wish it wasn't so...





 THE ERA OF WARRING STATES





 Tune in again!


 Era of Warring States


 W-Wait... A-Are you sure he's an Uchiha? Yes... If he's found out that you're Senju, he'll pretend to let his guard down
to steal intel on us. Do not trust him. No, he's not like that... You'd trust the clan who killed
your younger brother? You have no idea what
he's thinking inside his gut! If he tricks you, you'll be putting
the entire Senju Clan at risk. That's not... Just in case, Tobirama and I
will come along. Understood? Answer me! Yes. I know it's right off the bat, but how about we just skip stones
instead of exchanging greetings? Yeah... Hashirama... Sorry. I can't stay today... I just remembered something
I have to do. O-Oh yeah?
I'm going to head home then. RUN TRAP, SCRAM That speed!
He's planning to run for it! Damn Hashirama!
He warned him! Let's go, Tobirama! Yes! Seems like we're both
on the same page. Butsuma Senju. And Tobirama, I believe. Indeed, Tajima Uchiha. And Izuna, right? It seemed the Uchiha coincidentally
had the same idea. Exactly the same circumstances. Butsuma Senju and Tajima Uchiha
both knew from numerous prior clashes that they possessed
practically equal strength. - Stop!
- Stop! Shinobi are trained to keep
their hearts in check on the battlefield, no matter what happens. A single flash of emotional display
can lead to vulnerability and mean the difference
between life and death. However... The two adults were well aware... that if their own child were killed
right before their eyes, it would likely, no matter how slight,
unbalance their heart. Meaning... whoever could land the first strike
would determine the outcome. TRAP, SCRAM              RUN I'll never forgive anyone who tries
to hurt my little brother, no matter who they are! Same here! Hey, Hashirama... What is it? Maybe it just isn't possible for us... to reach that... pipe dream of ours... Madara... What are you...? It may have been brief,
but it was fun...Hashirama. Three against three... Can we take them, Madara? No... Hashirama is stronger than me. If we fight, we'll lose. There's a kid stronger than you, Brother? I see, quite impressive. Let's retreat! So long. Madara! You...really haven't given up, have you? You've gotten to the same point I... You are Senju. I truly wish it wasn't so. My brothers were killed
by the Senju. And your brothers, by the Uchiha... So there's no need to show
our guts to each other. Our next meeting will likely be
on the battlefield... Hashirama Senju. I'm...Madara Uchiha. Father! Look at Big Brother's eyes! We may not have obtained
any intel on the Senju... but it seems we gained something
valuable from this, after all. He awakened his Sharingan...just now? In that moment, I felt like I understood what awakening
the Sharingan truly signified. He decided to completely
erase his friend. To erase me from his life. After that, we battled.
We fought each other day after day. And before we knew it, we'd each become
our respective clan's leaders. We were at the furthest place possible... from the dream that
we wanted to fulfill. Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu! Water Style!
Water Dragon Missile! A blind attack... I curse the misfortune of the ones
who do not have the Sharingan. Flying Raijin Slice! Izuna! Hang in there! I swear I'll save you! Hashirama... Madara... You cannot defeat me. But I had never abandoned our dream. Why don't we end this? If the two strongest shinobi clans,
the Uchiha and Senju, join forces, nations will not be able to find other shinobi clans that
can stand against us... The conflict will eventually
start to die down. Come on. No... Big Brother... Izuna! Do not be deceived by them... Izuna! Have you forgotten that
these bastards killed everyone... killed the Uchiha? It was clear to all that the Uchiha Clan
was in an unfavorable position. In fact, defectors to the Senju
soon began showing up. And that's about when
Madara changed as well. He had obtained
the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. Those eyes... What happened to Izuna? My little brother ended up dying
from that day's wounds... Leaving me powers that
will help protect the Uchiha! I sent you a cease-fire agreement! If you truly want to protect the Uchiha,
let's stop fighting! Hashirama! Wood Style, Deep Forest Bloom! Poison Pollen eh? Enough, Madara! Fighting is meaningless! Meaningless? Then why did Izuna die? It's because....
because you bastards killed him! Wood Golem Jutsu! Hashirama! Madara, we were friends! And we shared the same dream! Hashirama! How long will you keep saying
such juvenile things? It's just not possible to show
our guts to each other! Don't you get it? Hashirama! Madara! At the end of a battle
that lasted a whole day... Madara's back touched
the ground for the very first time. Madara... You're finished. Wait, Tobirama. Why, Elder Brother?! This is our chance! No one touches him! Just get it over with, Hashirama. It would be an honor to die
by your hand. Stop posturing. If I kill the clan leader of the Uchiha, it will only incite the young ones
who follow you. There isn't anyone left with such pluck
among the Uchiha anymore. Sure there are. Perhaps not right now, but in time. Come on...
Why don't we end this war? We made a promise, remember? To create the ideal village someday. Can't we go back to those days...
and skip rocks together? That's just impossible. You and I are no longer the same. Let's build our settlement here! Heh... You're pretty much the only one
spouting such nonsense. Well then, what about you? Yeah... If that settlement gets built here, then I could watch over
my little brother, and protect him in this place
where you can see to no end! I don't have a single brother left. I have nothing to protect. And...I just can't trust you. Is there any way I can
convince you to trust us? Well, there is a way to
show each other our guts... Either kill your brother... or kill yourself right now. And then we'll be even.
I'd be willing to trust your clan. Kill your little brother or kill yourself? How dare you say
something so ridicu- I agree. This is crazy! So what are you going
to do, Elder Brother? Are you going to kill me now? Or are you going to die on account
of this guy's nonsense? It's idiotic. Don't listen to him! Thank you, Madara. You really are kindhearted. Madara had given me a choice, an option where I wouldn't have
to kill my little brother. He knew all too well... how an older brother feels
towards his younger siblings. Listen, Tobirama... Etch these words into your heart,
for these are my final words... Brother... Words that I shall be exchanging
with my life. You too, my fellow clan members. After my death, do not kill Madara. I forbid any fighting between
the Uchiha and Senju. Swear this right now... upon the lives of your fathers,
and your grandchildren yet unborn. Farewell... Enough... I have now seen your guts. It was like a dream... The Uchiha and the Senju
formed an alliance. There would no longer
be any casualties, nor would any more children
have to die. And so, we began building our village. Do you remember how we used
to talk here when we were brats?

 Yeah... I thought we were just talking
about our dream.

 That dream is now becoming a reality.

 There's no time to be weak right now!

 We're going to need to come up
with a name for the village too!

 Any thoughts?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"My True Dream"

 How about
the Village Hidden in the Leaves?


 MY TRUE DREAM


 Tune in again!


 It was like a dream... The Uchiha and the Senju
formed an alliance. There would no longer
be any casualties, nor would any more children
have to die. And so, we began
building our village. Later, we would ally
with the Land of Fire, and the creation of
a peaceful state where nation and village stood
on equal footing also commenced. In any case, it was like a dream. My True Dream


 SHINOBI ACADEMY Do you remember how we used
to talk here when we were kids? Yeah... Let's build our settlement here! Huh? And make it so kids won't have
to kill each other! We'll create a school where
kids can train and grow up stronger! Assign missions that fit
an individual's abilities and strengths! Have superiors who can properly
assign ranks to commissions! It will be a place where kids don't have to be sent
into harsh battlefronts. You're pretty much the only one
spouting such nonsense. Well then, what about you? It doesn't sound bad at all. Then it's decided! Yeah... If that settlement
gets built here, then I could watch over
my little brother, and protect him in this place
where you can see to no end! I thought we were just talking
about our dream. They say where there's a will,
there's a way... And yet, I... That dream is now becoming reality. The leader of shinobi who protects
the Land of Fire from the shadows. The Fire Shadow, or Hokage. Well? What's that supposed to be? The Land of Fire requests that
we select someone who will represent the Village. I'm considering naming you
to be our leader... the Hokage. You no longer have any siblings left... But I'd like you to think of
all of the village shinobi as your siblings. I want you to protect them
with all your might. Even though I couldn't protect
my own Uchiha brethren? Kawarama... Itama! Itama! W-What happened? My little brother...died. I come to the river
because I feel like all the haziness in my heart gets
washed away as I stare at the water. So that's what happened... Your name's Madara, right? I wonder if you're like me... Do you have siblings? I'm one of five. Well, there used to be five of us. So...you don't have
any more siblings? No... I have one younger brother left. And I'll protect him,
no matter what! What about you? I have one brother left too. And I intend to protect him too,
no matter what. Flying Raijin Slice! Izuna! There's no time to
get weak right now! In addition to the Uchiha and Senju, it seems the Sarutobi and
the Shimura Clans also want to join. Are you kidding? Are you serious?! And there are many others! This village is going to
keep on expanding! We're going to need to come up
with a name for the village too... Any thoughts? How about... The Village...Hidden in the Leaves? It's too simple...
It's not imaginative. You called it exactly as you saw it. How's it different from "Hokage"?! And you still have that habit
of getting depressed easily! It took a long time, but it felt like we were back to being
the friends we once were. So you're saying
the role of the Hokage is to stay in the village
and protect everyone? There's that... But he'll be even more significant. As village-building picks up speed,
the Hokage will get busier too. That's why I want to
have your likeness carved into this cliff at our feet. As a symbol of
our village's protector! You've got to be kidding! Although...your face is a bit too stern... so it will have to be softened
here and there. Well, it beats that sad mug of yours! Is it that sad? Yeah... It's beyond sad. Is that so? There you are! What are you dawdling here for? The Feudal Lords from the Land of Fire
will be here soon for the conference! It's Tobirama... For Hokage?! That's not your choice! To propose Madara as
a candidate for leader is fine... But the final decision will be made
with the top officials, after consulting with the Land of Fire
and the people of the village! Things are different from Father's era! But... Besides, Madara Uchiha being chosen
as the leader won't happen. Everyone knows... You are the one who founded
this settlement, Big Brother. Even those from
the Uchiha say as much. Furthermore, haven't you heard
the rumors about them? The stronger their hate, the stronger their Visual Prowess
manifests itself. The Sharingan is such a power. They're unpredictable. For the future of the village... Stop talking like that, Tobirama! I just felt someone's presence. Tobirama, you would know. No... I'm not infusing chakra right now. Don't change the subject, Big Brother! From now on,
things will be run democratically. Any objections? No... That's fine. And so...
I became the First Hokage. I became the First Hokage... From the Era of Warring States... where shinobi clans fought
and killed each other... the Uchiha and Senju joined together
to create the ideal shinobi village... A shinobi village born
from the hope for peace... That is the Village Hidden in the Leaves. And I became its First Hokage. This is the stone tablet that has been
passed down the Uchiha for generations. It's never been shown
to an outsider before. The special text requires
Visual Prowess to decipher. This is what I'm able
to decipher so far... "One god seeking stability
split into light and shadow. "And it is these opposites together
that give rise "to all things in this universe." This is a universal truth. In short, it states that
true happiness can be found when two contrary powers
cooperate together. However, it could be
interpreted differently. Hashirama... Do you think I don't know
what's going on? Leave Tobirama to me.
I can't do this without you. Help me as the Hokage's right hand...
and as a brother! The people will eventually
recognize your merits! And then,
I'll name you Second Hokage. After you, I suspect Tobirama
will probably become the Hokage. When he does, the Uchiha
will be eventually eliminated. Knowing this, I've reached out to other Uchiha
about leaving the village. But it seems no one is willing
to follow me. Madara... I couldn't protect
my younger brother... And it seems I won't be able
to keep the promise I made him... that I would protect the clan. I'm not even trusted
by the clan I want to protect. That's not true! Everyone is... Perhaps that time, the ultimatum
I should have given you was "to kill your younger brother." You call me your brother. But which of us would you kill
for the sake of the village? I'd like to think that
I know you pretty well. I've had enough. I'm going to leave the village. I've found a different path to take. It became clear to me because
we showed each other our guts... Cooperation is merely
a quiet form of conflict. You're wrong! I won't let it be like that. Hashirama, it's what
you make of reality. Let's stop being slaves to it. It's healthier to view this world
as merely a sideshow... Have you been listening
to me, Madara?! You are the only one
who's an even match for me. I'm looking forward
to the battles we'll fight... up until the time
I achieve my true dream. What is your true dream? I thought everything we've aimed for
is here in this village! You just can't see it... What's beyond this...
The dreams of the far future. Then tell me about your dreams
of the far future. If it's connected to
this village's dreams, I need your strength as a leader,
as a senior member. And...as a friend. There is no connection. And you'll never reach it. Chasing after me is useless. You, of all people, should know. No one is capable of
catching me from behind. Upon saying those words,
Madara left the village. We had come this far together. And now, Madara was gone from
the village we had created together. But in the world, everyone respected and copied
our village system of Allied Ninja Clans which had been created by the former warring rivals,
the Uchiha and Senju, joining forces. Villages like the Village Hidden
in the Leaves which began in the Land of Fire,
and its one leader system, LAND OF FIRE


spread like wildfire across
the Great Nations. In the Land of Lightning, LAND OF LIGHTNING

Hidden Cloud Village was formed
with its leader named Raikage. In the Land of Earth, LAND OF EARTH

Hidden Stone Village was formed
with its leader named Tsuchikage. LAND OF WATER

The Land of Water had the Hidden Mist
with their Mizukage. And in the Land of Wind, LAND OF WIND

the Hidden Sand was formed and
they named their leader, Kazekage. Not only the Great Nations, but even the smaller nations
adopted this system. Madara's and my dream had come true. Shinobi children learned
and played instead of battling. And they started living long enough
to even know the taste of alcohol. But, as if he wanted to destroy
his previous dream... Madara came back to
attack the Leaf Village. Will you destroy everything that
we've accomplished until now, Madara? Nothing will come of us
battling each other. This fight will only...
hurt the village and shinobi! It is disrespect toward
our siblings and our comrades! You know nothing... I don't want to kill you! Are you implying that
you could kill me at any moment? No! I'm saying we are friends... I've already...reached it! Then so be it! Sage Art! Wood Style... Shinsu Senju
Veritable 1000-Armed Kan'on! Here I come, Madara! Come, Hashirama! Chojo Kebutsu!
Artifacts of the Buddha! He stripped off the Susano'o! Here I come! 10th Edict on Enlightenment! Madara! Hashirama! I am the shinobi who created
these circumstances.

 And I believe that shinobi are those
who endure for a purpose.

 Those who endure...

 Now, Sasuke... What will you do?

 Will you crush the village? Or...?

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,230
Could it be? Sakura, you've got it all wrong. I'm not peeking! Naruto! <i>And here I told you not to...
<i>not to...not to...</i> Oww! Forgive me...Sakura. Sakura...! Is it morning already...? I don't...feel like I slept at all... Did he get up already...? <i>His stuff...</i> <i>Sai's stuff is gone...</i> <i>Where...did he go?!</i> Morning, Naruto. C-Captain Yamato... That jerk, that jerk Sai... Sai's outside. Your timing's perfect. I've got something
I want to ask you to do for me... <i>Untitled


</i> Wow... So you draw. Is there something you want? You're foul-mouthed,
but you've also got a sensitive side, huh? That's a surprise. That fake smile...
So you're still not through hitting me, huh? Not quite... I'm kidding!
I just came to check out your picture. I was wondering what you were drawing. I see... At first, I thought you were drawing
a landscape since you're drawing out here... But it's an abstract, huh? What's the title of this drawing? You haven't decided on one yet? I don't know. You don't know...? The name of this drawing, a title. You've got something in mind, don't you? I won't laugh, so tell me. I've got nothing like that. What?! I've drawn tens of thousands
of pictures... but I've never given one a title. So this doesn't have one, either... Really? But you're supposed to give
a title to a picture, right? If it's a portrait,
you give it the name of the person... Or with other pictures, you use the situation,
your feelings or emotions at the time... To be exact, I couldn't title
one of my drawings even if I wanted to... Nothing comes to mind.
I don't...feel anything. Nothing... No wonder you can only say
such callous things! It's about time for us to leave! Captain Yamato told me
to come get you. Right. This drawing's nothing special! You're right...
Just like your "equipment." I'm going to be straight with you! I can't stand you! If you've got a problem, stop the fake smiles
and tell me straight to my face! I'll take you on anytime
you want to fight! Oh... You want to fight?! I've got... no problem with you. I don't care about you at all. Please go on ahead. I'll catch up once I've tidied up. I'll help. This...isn't printed. Did you draw this, too? Yes. Wow, it's a picture book, huh? That looks cool. Oh! Say... can I take a look
at it along the way? I can't let you see it. It's not finished yet... And I don't hand this over to people. This is my older brother's book, so... <i>But he said he drew it himself...</i> <i>What's he talking about?</i> Thank you... Please come again... So has your rapport improved? Why do we have to be with this guy? So would you have preferred
control by fear? I-It's okay. Our rapport has improved! Naruto looks like he's enjoying himself... What're you talking about? That's a fake smile
any way you look at it. Really? You yourself said that
a smile is the best way to get through a tough situation, right? Oh yeah. <i>I don't feel anything.
<i>I don't care about you at all.</i> It's just about time. What is it, Captain Yamato? This way. Huh? Hurry up! O-Okay! Why are we going to the trouble
of coming through here...? Captain Yamato!
What's the meaning of this?! I think the path we were on
was the right way. Captain! I'm sure Lady Tsunade has told you. What're you talking about? The information Sakura
got might be a trap. There's a possibility that
the Akatsuki might be... waiting to ambush us
at the Tenchi Bridge. They might be after you, Naruto. No way... I don't think there's a great possibility, but you can never be too careful. We'll proceed along a covert route
as much as possible until we reach the Tenchi Bridge. Right, got it. I guess this spot is okay. Huh? Don't tell me... We'll rest here tonight. What?! If we're going to camp out, we should use the cave we just passed by
instead of this wide open area... Step back, everyone. Wood Style: Four Pillar House Jutsu! We'll camp out here tonight. I don't think you can call something
like this camping out. This is amazing... Wow, so this is what it looks
like on the inside. It's quite spacious, isn't it? I think our room just might
hold some promise. Welcome
Team Kakashi Over there... Huh? It's surprisingly bare, isn't it? W-Well, it's better than sleeping outside. You're right. Break time, break time! Now if only we had a bath, too. Is there something you want? Nothing at all! Gather around, everyone. And I want to ask
you something, Sakura. What is it? It's about the Akatsuki's Sasori. Sasori... I wanted to ask you sooner, but I promised that we weren't going to
talk about stuff like that yesterday. I want you to tell me everything today... You're the only one who's ever
seen Sasori in person, after all... Yes, sir. For the time being, I've received a file on Sasori
from the Hidden Sand... But tell me in as much detail
as you can about his personality, behavior,
mannerisms and habits if he has any. What's this about? The spy who's infiltrated
Orochimaru's organization thinks Sasori is going to meet him
at the Tenchi Bridge. They might see us through immediately, but it's probably best to approach
by transforming into Sasori. If Sasori doesn't show up
at the Tenchi Bridge, then the spy might not, either... There's a distinct possibility. Then there'd be no point. Being a spy is a very risky act, after all. Which means the spy is probably
being quite cautious. Then are you going to transform
into Sasori, Captain Yamato? I'll probably have to. It seems he always remained
hidden inside this Hiruko puppet. So I'm probably the right one for this
since I can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu. You're right. And also, assuming this turns out
to be an Akatsuki trap... I'll approach him alone at first. <i>At midday in ten days,
<i>go to the Tenchi Bridge</i> <i>located in the Village Hidden
<i>in the Grass!</i> <i>What do you mean?</i> <i>I've got a spy working as one
<i>of Orochimaru's subordinates...</i> <i>I was supposed to rendezvous...
<i>with him...there...</i> The way he talked being near death... I don't think he was lying... And there was indeed a spy
called Yura in the Sand Village... This is just assuming
something goes wrong. You guys stand by until
I give you instructions. Either way, there's no doubting... that spy is probably
considerably powerful. Let's do this! Now then... Now for the main issue... Let me explain the mission in
a little more detail. Our goal is just to arrest the target. We must not let him die,
even if we end up having to fight. We'll lose an important source of
information if the target is killed. And a mission like this is more difficult
than just killing an enemy. As this is a delicate mission,
I will make the first move. And you guys will be my back-up... The strategy is simple.
First, I restrain the target. Second, if I should fail
to restrain the target and this turns into a battle, you guys shift to battle formation. I will give you a signal when
I want you to do this. And in the event of the second case, you are to operate with
the Buddy System. B-Buddy System? When one person takes action,
a partner always backs you up. Reciprocal back-up is
a fundamental rule. You know about this, don't you? Oh, yeah! That, huh? Get it together, will you? Now I'm going to determine
the Buddy Teams. First, Sakura and I will be one team! And... the other team will be...
Naruto and Sai! <i>Me...?</i> <i>with him...?</i> You jerk! Don't you know
what the word comrade is? Of course! I could explain it
to you if you like. That's not what I mean! Please don't blame your lack
of individual competence on others. What?! It isn't ideal to fight while
protecting someone who has lost his cool. All I did was consider the best way
to successfully complete the mission, make a judgment and take action. I'll never acknowledge you! I wonder what Sasuke would've done. Next episode:
"Simulation" Sasuke's Answer

 This time... you're not going to
reach the other side! I'm the one still standing. Opposite from the last time. I just want to protect... the dream I finally realized. I don't want anymore... You look pretty depressed, Hashirama. Can't perk back up this time, eh? Can't we show each other
our guts? The first steps are for us to
not give up on our ideals and to get a lot stronger. Let's build our settlement here! They say where there's a will,
there's a way... And yet, I... That dream is now becoming reality. A Wood Style Clone... I can't believe my back was taken... I will protect our...no, my village. No matter what. I still believe to this day
that protecting the village will lead to the protection of
the people, shinobi, and children! I will not forgive anyone
who threatens the village. Be they a friend...sibling...
or even my own child... You've changed...Hashirama. I made up my mind right then... to endure in order to watch
over the present. You've got your priorities backwards. Ultimately... It shall someday
lead the village to darkness. And thus...my battle with Madara
came to an end. I don't know how Madara
returned to life now. I definitely killed my friend... For the sake of the village. That's right... The village... that Madara and I first envisioned... is something that joined
one clan to another. It was an invaluable cornerstone
that created order out of chaos, then maintained it. It protected the children and
averted pointless conflict. It made peace a reality. However...it gave rise to despair, the kind that your brother Itachi
was forced to bear. Perhaps what Madara said
was correct, after all. Perhaps he foresaw
this state of affairs. I am the shinobi who created
these circumstances. Furthermore, I am also the one
who considered them acceptable. I believe that shinobi are those
who endure for a purpose. But depending on what that purpose is,
a shinobi can change. Just as Madara...and I did. Shinobi... Shinobi are those who endure... in order to achieve their goals. For me, it was building a village. But it seems Madara
found something else. This plan of Madara's that
Orochimaru mentioned earlier... To erase all the shinobi in this world... I don't know what
that means in literal terms, but... It's the Infinite Tsukuyomi where village, shinobi,
and citizen are all irrelevant. He intends to put everyone
under genjutsu and manipulate them as he sees fit. To negate everything that
my older brother, Madara's younger brother... and all of you... have tried to protect. My older brother inherited your will
without even talking to you. My older brother... Itachi... You also serve as
the Uchiha Clan's pipeline to the Village nerve center. You know that, don't you? Even as he shouldered that
heavy responsibility for the clan... We cannot allow such a thing! If they are going to start a revolution
and usurp our power, we have no choice but to judge
the Uchiha as traitors of the Leaf! Wait, Koharu. Don't rush to such a decision. But Hiruzen, the Uchiha Clan
will not be dissuaded. We must take measures
to avoid mayhem. And that includes innocent children. Do not say such things
before Itachi! Besides, taking on the Uchiha
will be no easy task. There's got be some sort of
strategy we can use! We have no time to waste. We must strike preemptively,
before they have a chance to act. If we join forces with our respective
ANBU Black Ops and launch a surprise attack
from behind, it will be over in no time. The Uchiha are old comrades
in arms. I want to settle this with
words first before force. I will come up with a strategy. Itachi... Buy me some time,
however little it may be. He stood between the village
and the clan in their strife... I see... So you've aligned
with the other side? Father, Mother... I... I know, Itachi. Itachi, just promise me this. Take care of Sasuke. I will. Do not fear. This is the path you have chosen. Compared to you,
our pain will be over in an instant. Even if our philosophies differ,
I am proud of you. You are truly a kind child. He even killed his own parents... We received intel that Itachi Uchiha
of the Akatsuki is dead. Put a mark on his image and
remove him from your Bingo Book. So that traitor is dead at last. But Captain,
who was able to kill him? Looks like it was
his younger brother, Sasuke. How ironic... His own brother killed the one
who slaughtered their kin. Serves him right! After that atrocious thing he did! Not only that, he joined up
with the Akatsuki and came after the Leaf Village! He's the most notorious villain
in Hidden Leaf history! I wish we got our hands on him first! He was forced to kill
his own clan and endure the brand as
a Rogue Ninja... Yet, he continued to keep
an eye on the organization that wanted to harm the village. And even in death... I'll have protected my village as Itachi Uchiha
of the Leaf once again. I have no more regrets. My older brother endured longer
and harder than you. And died stating he was proud
to be Leaf Shinobi. Isn't it ironic that the shinobi who
understood you more than anyone else... was from the Uchiha Clan? Your brother was not the only one. I had a subordinate
named Kagami Uchiha who was much like your brother. Second Hokage... I thought
you despised the Uchiha. That's not entirely true. I treated anyone who posed
a danger to the village, no matter what clan they belonged to,
with extreme caution. And there's no doubt that
the Uchiha Clan warranted my suspicions... The Uchiha just happened
to be a clan particularly disposed
to be considered as such. But, it is also because
they could feel such deep love that there were quite
a few Uchiha over the years like your brother and Kagami... who could transcend
the boundaries of the clan and devote themselves to the village. My elder brother believed the village was something that could
eliminate the framework of clans. Well, the reality is...
This wasn't so simple. The idealism of
my elder brother Hashirama... And the danger that Madara posed... Mediating between these two things, and protecting and
strengthening the village were my duties as
the Second Hokage. Shisui Uchiha was
a descendant of Kagami Uchiha. He was a friend of
your older brother Itachi. Many, including myself, embraced
the First Hokage's Will of Fire. But perhaps, I was more naïve
than any other shinobi. I wasn't able to continue
the Second Hokage's task of village-building skillfully enough. Which is how I ended up burdening Danzo
with the village's darkness. I killed Danzo in vengeance. Until the end, he spoke that
he would protect the village, no matter how dirty the means. It seems I've failed miserably
time after time as the Hokage. I guess I'm responsible for creating
the situation that exists now. No... You're not to blame, Lord Third. You did everything you could
for the sake of the village respectably. I'm the one who died during
the Nine Tails' attack on the village! You had such high hopes for me
as the Hokage... And I couldn't live up to them. I'll say... After he passed over me
and picked you. Everyone was so disappointed. Lord Orochimaru...
You sound like you're pouting. A little...since the Third Hokage
is right here. Had I lived, perhaps I could
have helped to foil the Uchiha's plans for
a coup d'état much sooner... Now then... Sasuke... What will you do? Will you destroy the village? Or... Sorry, Sasuke... Let's do it some other time. Sorry, Sasuke. Let's do it next time... You probably hate me, huh? But, we only have each other
as siblings. I'm always going to
be there for you, even if it's only as an obstacle
for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me... That's what big brothers are for. You all suspect me? There is no value in killing you now...
my foolish little brother. If you wish to kill me,
resent me, hate me, and survive...in obscurity. I did what you said... I resented you and
hated you... and I survived just so I... so I could kill you! I have no interest
in someone like you... You're weak,
because you don't have enough... hate. I always lied to you and
asked you to forgive me. Deliberately keeping you at
a distance by my own hand. All because I didn't want you
to get caught up in any of this. But now, I believe... That perhaps you could have changed Father, Mother,
and the rest of the Uchiha. If I had been open with you
from the start... And looked you straight in the eyes
and told you the truth, then I wouldn't have had
to stand before you, from above, as a failure,
telling you all of this. So this time... I want to impart
this truth to you... You don't ever have to forgive me. And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this... I will love you always. I'm going to the battlefield! I won't let the village,
and Itachi become nothing! It's been decided then! Tobirama! Prepare to fly us outside! Even if I wanted to use Flying Raijin,
I'm bound right now. Orochimaru, was it?
What will you do? You said earlier that
you'd follow Sasuke. Of course... We will accompany him. What?! J-Jugo, what about you? I'm going too. It's my job to protect Sasuke. Four super-strong zombies... Three monsters... If I tag along, I'm dead for sure! I'm making a break for it
when I see a chance! This view brings back memories! It's now or never! What the hell?! It's you after all, Sasuke! I sensed your chakra
and I couldn't believe it, so I backtracked and look what I find! Karin... Oh my... So many of my best experiments
gathered here in one place! You bastard...! I'll never forgive you! I'm sorry, Karin. You bastard! As if a simple apology
will get you off the hook... you good for nothing... I see you still have
a weakness for Sasuke, Karin... Listen, Lord Orochimaru! Sasuke...had the gall...
to stab me and... What a coincidence. Me too. But I'm helping Sasuke now. This is perfect timing. You help too. What?! I guess I have no choice... Who is she? Judging from the chakra
and that red hair... She's from the Uzumaki Clan. One more idiot joins the pack. I bet Madara will be surprised. Orochimaru... Why did you decide to help Sasuke? You were trying to destroy the village. After being inside Kabuto,
I realized something... He imitated the way I lived and
tried to possess everything, and failed. So now, I'm just curious about
the different path Sasuke has chosen. Unlike Kabuto, Sasuke didn't copy me. Fellow Hokage! As we stand atop the Great Stone Faces that have watched over
the Hidden Leaf... Let us burn this sight of
the village into our memory! I'm finally going to see my son. Naruto, I wasn't able to do
anything for you as a father... I'll make it up to you by
bringing you a huge present. All right! It's been a while
since my last war! I'd better be on my toes! Madara... We'll defeat you
this time for sure! This may sound foolish, but I'm kind of looking forward
to seeing my old friend! Just you wait, Madara! There's always conflict,
no matter what the era. But this shall be the end of wars! Let's go! Obito, you once dreamed
of becoming Hokage.

 I can't see you not understanding
Naruto's feelings!

 You can still go back!

 It's because I understand
Naruto's mind...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hole"

 ...that I want to negate everything
that he does!

 HOLE

 Tune in again!

 Unlike you guys... I don't want to sever
any of my bonds... or get them cut off! We shouldn't have cut them. Disappear! Hole


 Fire Style: Majestic Flower Flame! Fire Style: Bomb Blast Dance! We're safe! If we didn't have
Naruto's Chakra Cloak, we'd be crisper than a roast pig! The next round is coming! Naruto's chakra has been protecting
everyone this whole time. Naruto, are you sure
you're okay to keep this going? He's gone! Where'd he go? He disappeared... He escaped... That's impossible. Find him! Above you, Naruto! Naruto, you're only fighting
defensively now, trying to protect everyone. Is there any meaning to all of this? Are you all right, Naruto? It's too much for you to control
the chakra that I gave you, all at once. You'll wear yourself out
in no time. Also, it looks like Ten Tails
is charging chakra, so you'd better watch out! You're only growing weaker. I don't think you'd understand,
since you want to be alone... But having everyone by my side
makes me really, really happy! That alone gives me strength! Did he run away? If the pain of your comrades' deaths
is part of your bond... then there's no need
to protect them, right? What the hell,
you quibbling bastard?! That's what I hate about you! That's not what I‘m talking
about you, quibbling idiot! I'm saying I can endure any pain
if it involves my comrades. It means I don't want
to give them up! It might seem selfish
of me... But it's more painful for me to not
have any comrades in here! Obito... What are you trying to
confirm through Naruto? Cha! There's no mistake! This chakra is... Hashirama! Dad! It's collapsing! I can't hold it back any longer! Damn it, it's repelling
this Mountain Jutsu enhanced with Naruto's chakra! There's no other jutsu
that can stop it, Dad! Bad news, Naruto! The Ten Tails is planning to
do the Cataclysm! What the heck is that?
Cat-a-what? Stop wasting time! The land's going to
be ripped apart! It can't be controlled anymore, because you cut the link
between Ten Tails and me. Although I guess it's about time
I became its Jinchuriki. The real fun...
is just beginning! This time, I'll make
the Ten Tails disappear! Kamui! Looks like you were waiting
for your chance. But so was I, Kakashi. Kakashi Sensei! Naruto, you take care
of things here! Kakashi Sensei! Here it comes! The Cataclysm! That should have cleaned
most of them out. Naruto protected us again. Naruto... Is that all you've got? It's disappearing! Nice try pretending to be tough, but
it seems you've reached your limit. You've given me something
to look forward to... but I think it's time
you made your exit. Everyone! Let's join together
and fight as one! - Right!
- Right! Hinata! Time for you to recover! You guys... Such a futile demonstration. Lightning Blade! So there's still doubt
in your heart. You've had several chances to
kill me if you really wanted to. One more blow! It's pathetic that
you feel compassion towards an enemy
in the midst of fighting. Is it guilt? Are you feeling remorse
over the fact that you couldn't protect Rin and
keep your promise to me? Are you hoping that
I'll have a change of heart? Obito... Let's stop this already! Your dream long ago was
to become the Hokage... Naruto has the same dream. Naruto's words are exactly
what you used to say in the past. I'm going to be the Hokage!
I'm Obito Uchiha! For my Great Stone Face, make sure my trademark goggles
and Sharingan are nicely carved out! My dream is to surpass
the Hokage someday! And...I'm going to make everyone
in the village accept me! You haven't realized it... But you've been trying to merge
your past self with the current Naruto... Hearing the old you
in Naruto's words. Is it because you secretly want
to be repudiated by your old self? I can't see you not understanding
Naruto's feelings! You can still go back...
to the person you once were! It's because I understand
Naruto's mind... That I want to hear it all... And negate everything
that he does! Obito... By the way, let me tell you
one more thing. This guilt you feel towards me
is really presumptuous. If you believe that I started
this war simply over you and Rin... To call you misdirected,
would be an understatement! I know everything. I know that Rin deliberately ran
into your Lightning Blade. That she chose to die. Back then, Rin had been kidnapped
by the Hidden Mist and forced to become
the Three Tails' Jinchuriki. You succeeded in rescuing Rin
and got her out... But that was part of
the Hidden Mist's plan. They even pretended
to pursue you to get you home
to the Leaf quicker. How did you...? Damn it! You all stay here. Captain... Let's wait
for reinforcements. We don't have time... The Hidden Mist kidnapped Rin
in order to use her as some kind of test subject... If she's taken to
the Blood Mist Village, we'll never get her out. But you can't go alone! I won't be alone. Summoning Jutsu! Can you pick up Rin's scent? I remember it. Leave it to me. When the reinforcements arrive,
tell them that we went after Rin. Yes, sir. Wait for me, Rin! I will definitely protect you! It's the Leaf! A Leaf shinobi! All right! We're going
to divert the enemy! You guys wait here. This way, Kakashi. Rin! They put her under a genjutsu. Release! Kakashi! Let's get out of here! Leaf shinobi!
They have the captive! Hurry! Don't let them get away! Go! We'll divert the enemy. Thanks, I leave it to you. Save it. If we're driven into a corner,
we'll make a run for it too. Let's go, Rin. Kakashi... I...feel strange... We have to escape first. Scatter! I feel it... I feel like there's someone,
something else inside me. What are you talking about? I don't know. - There they are!
- Don't let them get away! We have to get past them! The Hidden Mist tried to perform
some kind of ritual on me. A special ritual. But I lost consciousness and... They're persistent! I can't return to the Leaf Village! What are you saying?! Kakashi, you have to kill me now! What are you saying, Rin?! They're using me. If I return, Hidden Leave Village
may be attacked! I promised Obito that
I would protect you! I can't do such a thing! There's got to be a way
out of this! In any case, we need
to make it to the village! No, Kakashi... I'll stop them. Now go! I can't... Once Rin made it back
to the Leaf, the Hidden Mist intended to make
the Three Tails rampage and attack the village. Rin realized this... And took advantage of the Lightning Blade
you aimed at the enemy... to commit suicide. She made up her mind to die
at the hands of the one she loved. In order to protect
the Hidden Leaf. No matter what you say, to me, you're still an impostor
who couldn't protect Rin. To me, Rin is someone
who wasn't supposed to die. So Rin dead is also an impostor. Rin is Rin because she is alive! The things that created
all these circumstances... The system of shinobi, village,
and the shinobi themselves... What caused me to despair,
is this world itself. This counterfeit world! Remember Naruto's words? That it's most painful not to have real comrades
inside one's heart? I quoted exactly what
you said long ago to him... I know the old you would have
resonated with that. And I still believe
the current you, can as well-! Look! There's nothing in my heart! I don't even feel pain anymore. Don't feel so guilty, Kakashi. This hole was opened
by this hellish world. In the past,
all I felt was pain here. What's the meaning in that? So I abandoned everything. You've been suffering all this time,
haven't you? As you stood at Rin's grave...
and at my grave. Kakashi... Enough already. You don't have to
suffer anymore. Rin is here. I love you, Kakashi. Along with your ideal version of me. I'm gonna be Hokage! You can wish for
whatever you want... You can have anything you
desire in this Genjutsu World. The hole in your heart
can be filled immediately. Rin is gone. You are still alive! Do you really think
that something like this can fill that hole in your heart? Don't erase the memories
of the real Rin! Rin sacrificed herself to protect
and save the village! You can try and fill that hole
with delusions all by yourself... But that hole will never be filled! It's transforming again! What's your issue with
a Genjutsu World?

 Reality is cruel.

 This hole is only going
to get bigger.

 Things don't always go
the way you want.

 Nor does help always
get there in time.

 Just like how it was with me!

 Just like how
I couldn't get there in time!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
 
 “Something to Fill the Hole”

 Wouldn't you agree, Kakashi?
 

 SOMETHING TO FILL THE HOLE


 Tune in again!


 Something to Fill the Hole


 Everyone! Let's join together
and fight as one! - Right!
- Right! Hinata! Time for you to recover! You guys... Such a futile demonstration. It's transforming again! No, it's only reverting
to its original form. That was only its attack form. However... It's just one stage away
from its final transformation. Naruto's still recovering, and Nine Tails is
infusing chakra right now. Right now, it's up to us, Bee! Right. We'll show everyone the way! Listen to me, Bee... If we let it undergo
its final transformation, we've lost. We must stop it now! Ten Tails isn't holding back... It probably got impatient after seeing the same Tailed Beasts
inside Naruto! The fun's just beginning,
but it looks like I need to move soon. It's getting bigger and bigger. I- Is it after Naruto? Honestly, how're we going
to stop that thing without Naruto's chakra? We can't waver after
coming this far! Naruto is putting everything
into doing what has to be done. It's even more painful for me...
not to have any comrades in here! Naruto's words just now
made it clear! Yeah. He's been going
out of his way even to protect shinobi like us... That's not what
I was talking about! He's told us that he considers all of us his comrades
from the bottom of his heart. Comrades... Comrades... - We're...
- That's right, I'm his... - Me, too...
- That's right, we all are... We all are... Yeah. We're comrades! Comrades! Comrades! I'll fully heal Naruto! We have to do
what we have to do! If we're going to die anyway, we might as well go down... fighting to the best of our abilities! Ino! I want you to link me
with someone! You've got a plan, haven't you? I knew you would
come through, Shikamaru! Isn't there anything
we can do, Dad? I don't have enough chakra. Kitsuchi! Please hear me out! You're Shikaku's child... Teach me the signs to
an easy Earth Style Barrier that even non-Stone Ninja
can perform! One that anyone could perform
would be too weak! It would be better to... No, it's crucial that
everyone be able to produce it. If the enemy has quality,
we've got quantity. But these walls will
be blown away quickly. Even if they are if we keep creating more,
they'll act like a shield. We're going to slow
that thing's momentum with many weak walls rather than
try to stop it with one powerful one! Of course, I intend to have
all of you from the Hidden Stone build me a super wall as well... I see... Your idea might be
worth a try. All right,
these are the hand signs! Before we start... Master Bee! While everyone is
building barriers, I want you to bombard that thing
with Tailed Beast Bombs to shift its trajectory upwards. Ino... Next, I want you to link me with every shinobi here
on the battlefield. Can you do it? Doesn't matter, I will do it! What's your issue with
a Genjutsu World? Reality is cruel. This hole is only going to get bigger. Things don't always
go the way want them. Nor does help always
get there in time. Just like how it was with me! Just like how I couldn't
get there in time! Wouldn't you agree, Kakashi? How are you going to seal
this hole by staying in this world?! I may be trash as a shinobi,
but I've learned a few things. The hole in one's heart gets filled
by others around you. Friends won't flock to
someone who abandons the memory of his friends
and gives up on the world... Just because things don't go
the way he wants them to. That won't help fill
the hole in your heart. And people don't help those
who run away and do nothing. As long as you don't give up,
there will always be salvation. No matter what you do... It's over. - Earth Style Barrier!
- Earth Style Barrier! Here it comes, Bee! Let's go! Its power is off the charts! It's more powerful than I thought. At this rate... The last barrier...! Lord Bee! All your tedious whitewashing! One can only achieve true happiness
by abandoning reality and ridding yourself of
the memories of your comrades! In the ninja world, those who
break the rules are scum. But...those who abandon
their friends are worse than scum. And...those who don't care
about their friends' feelings... are even worse scum! It vanished...? I won't abandon my memory
of the old you. Even if it's the current you
who's repudiating it. Am I late? Nope. Right on time, Dad! FOURTH HOKAGE Who...? Who's...? My name's Minato Namikaze. Brace for an impending explosion. What is that? What? I sent Ten Tails' attack
back toward the sea. - What's that?!
- Is it an attack?! Watch out! What the hell's going on?! What just happened?! That shock wave came
out of nowhere! What's with that?! Stop complaining! We're lucky that
we got off that easily! He has Reanimation eyes! Wh-Who are you? Relax. I'm an ally. Thanks for healing Naruto! Are you... Naruto's girlfriend? Huh? Hmm... Uh-huh... Yeah! I suppose you could say that. You keep quiet! Don't waste your energy talking! You're supposed to be healing me,
but I just suffered more damage... I'll heal the extra damage too! She reminds me a little of Kushina... Please go easy on my son. So, why did this happen so suddenly? It seems like you knew. I sensed his chakra when
I was in Nine Tails Mode. The others should be arriving soon... Something's coming! Minato, you're as fast as ever! Lord Third Hokage?! And also... That's the...! Fourth... You're better
at teleporting than I am! All right, let's do this! No way! I don't believe it... Lords First... Second... Third... and even Lord Fourth... Minato! So you're the ones
who stopped the attack, Lords Hokage! But who reanimated you? Orochimaru summoned us. We need to stop this war quickly. What? Didn't Orochimaru die? This is amazing! The previous Hokage are going
to join us in battle! Now that's reassuring! I don't know
what's going on anymore... There's still more help coming, but they're taking a little longer. I've been waiting for you, Hashirama! I'll deal with you later! I have to stop
the Ten Tails first! He hasn't changed a bit. We're never on the same page. After all... It's charging towards us... You've done well, Naruto. Take a little break. Your friend will be here soon. He's our ally too. He is? This presence... It's Minato... What's going on? My fellow Hokage, let's go! Second and Third,
stand in front of me. That's exactly like Naruto's... I never imagined
Minato would too! See! You see! Isn't my dad awesome?! I know that better than you! Reaper Death Seal! Let's put our trust in this child! He's our son, after all! Seal! After all, he's the one who
split me up before sealing me away! THIRD HOKAGE Have you already placed
your markers? Yes. You're quick at striking too! He vanished! Let's go! Ninja Art... - Four Crimson Ray Formation!
- Four Crimson Ray Formation! And...I'll just add on... Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates! Ten Seals! A red barrier?! It's said to be dozens of times
more powerful than the Four Purple
Flames Formation! It's a barrier that requires four Hokage-class shinobi
together to create! It won't be able to move
so easily now. You sure took your time
getting here, Sasuke. Sasu...ke? Is that you, Sakura? S-Sasuke! Why?! S-Sasuke! Hey, Ino! Stop! He's an enemy! Ino... You better keep your distance! You're all still as noisy as ever! Why the hell are you here, bastard?! Why are you here, Sasuke? A lot of things have happened. I've decided to protect Leaf Village. And then, I'll... become Hokage. What?! You can't just come back
all of a sudden and crack a lame joke like that,
you Rogue Ninja! Do you even know
what it means to be Hokage? I don't know what happened to you,
but that's not possible. Do you even realize
what you're saying? Do you think we can just forget
all the things you've done? Yeah, I realize you probably can't. But... it doesn't matter
what you guys think of me. All of the previous Kage created
these current circumstances. So I will become Hokage
and change the village. You don't become Hokage in order to be acknowledged
by the village. The one who is acknowledged
by everyone, is the one who becomes Hokage. I leave Sasuke to you. Leave it to me. I'm going to be Hokage! I'm glad there's so much interest
in becoming Hokage... But you guys are
taking too much time! Start infusing chakra right now! We'll take down Ten Tails
with an all-out attack! Thanks for healing me, Sakura! Now it's your turn to get some rest. Let's go, Sasuke! Sakura? So do you see me as
some sort of weak woman who can't keep up with you two? Do you think Lady Tsunade
would be the only one out of the Legendary Sannin
to inadequately train her student? I'm almost there... I'll be at full capacity in a little bit. Then I can output my true power. Just like you,
I'm a member of Team 7... and I'm a student of
one of the Legendary Sannin! Okay then! Team 7 is finally back! Let's go, Sakura! Sasuke! Right! Yeah! That sight sure brings
back memories, doesn't it, Shikamaru? Well, if he's willing to
help us defeat the enemy, I won't turn him away. Even tho' I don't want to accept him... It's been a long time since
our class has been back together. I haven't felt like this
since the Chunin Exam. I'm going to become Hokage! Hey, are you guys even listening?! Kiba, no one's paying attention right now...
and it's pitiful. Stop it. It's because the impact of
Sasuke's sudden appearance and his declaration to
become Hokage are much too great. Kiba, I heard you! We should all aspire
to become Hokage! Let's show them
what we're made of, ya know! Ever since I was a genin,

 I thought I was
a full-fledged kunoichi.

 But I ended up hiding
behind Sasuke and Naruto.

 I hated the way I was.

 I swore then, that next time,

 I would make them
stare at my back!

 And now finally, I...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Team 7 Assemble!"


 Cha! TEAM 7 ASSEMBLE!


 Tune in again!


 Sasuke! Why?! You're all still as noisy as ever! Why the hell
are you here, bastard?! Why are you here, Sasuke? A lot of things have happened. I've decided to protect
the Leaf Village. And then, I'll... become Hokage. What?! Okay then! Team 7 is... finally back! Let's go, Sakura! Sasuke! Team 7, Assemble!

 That sight sure brings back memories,
doesn't it, Shikamaru? Well, if he's willing to help us
defeat the enemy, I won't turn him away. Even though I don't want to accept him... It's been a long time since
our class has been back together. I haven't felt like this
since the Chunin Exam. I'm going to become Hokage! Hey, are you guys even listening?! Kiba, no one's paying attention
right now and it's pitiful. Stop it. It's because the impact of
Sasuke's sudden appearance and his declaration to become
Hokage are much too great. Kiba, I heard you! We should all aspire
to become Hokage! Let's show them
what we're made of, ya know! Sasuke… What are you thinking
right now? Okay then! Wait a minute! Huh?! It's that thing again! It wants to break the barrier! Fellow previous Hokage! Please re-focus and
prepare yourselves! We know that! Now then... It held up! What an amazing barrier… To be able to keep that thing out… Where's the Ten Tails?! That Ten Tails, he hit himself! It's not some simple barrier! Wow… The previous Hokage were
truly amazing people! Looks like they weren't just all talk. Wood Style: Wood Clone Jutsu! I'll make entry points
on all four sides of the barrier, so shinobi can go in and out! Follow me! All right! Go! Right! It's not over yet! Sage Arts: Gracious Deity Gates! Head Seal! Now then,
time to deal with you. Sorry to keep you waiting, Madara… No... A clone is no fun. I'll wait for the real one
to show up. Now! Fission Beings? It's trying to keep us away
from its real body! Don't waver! Yes… I… I… Sasuke! Demon Wind Shuriken,
Windmill of Shadows! Over here! Quit joking around! Summoning Jutsu! Take that for now. Then eat this! This kid...impossible! Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu! That's right…
Ever since I was a genin, I thought I was
a full-fledged kunoichi. But I ended up hiding
behind Sasuke and Naruto. The two of them risked everything
to protect me. I hated the way I was. I swore then, that next time, I would make them
stare at my back! Even I... Even I can… Now it's your turn
to gaze at my back! That's what I vowed back then… But Naruto and Sasuke kept
progressing faster and faster… So I gave up… Thinking it was useless
because they were just too strong! I thought I'd never be able
to catch up to them. But… Naruto! Sasuke! Stop! Both of you, stop! I didn't think about it… and I put the entire burden
on Naruto. I went crying to you. I held onto you, expecting you
to make it all better. While I did nothing. I'm sorry, Naruto. You may have to wait
for me a little bit. Next time I'm coming with you! Please take me on as your apprentice! Cha! Your movements are getting better! By the way, do you remember
the first thing I taught you? Of course. Medic Ninja must never
get themselves killed. Thus they must never force
their way forward. That is true… However, that does not mean that you don't have to learn jutsu
necessary to fight on the frontline. First and foremost,
you are my disciple. A kunoichi who will inherit
the power of the Legendary Sannin. And…Sakura Haruno… You are also the disciple
of the Fifth Hokage! And... I just now reached full capacity.
And I can finally unleash it! Cha! I am never, ever talking back
to Sakura ever again. She'll destroy me. What monster strength! It might just be greater than Tsuna's! Amassing chakra at a continuous rate
over three years… requiring extremely
delicate chakra control. The 100 Healings Mark
that I couldn't even achieve. And I have no need to keep up
a youthful appearance! Wind Style… Inferno Style… - Rasen Shuriken!
- Flame Control! Sasuke! Um… I'm here too…Sakura! Don't drag us down, Naruto. He's right! Keep complaining and I'll just grab the title
of Hokage away from you! Huh? Not you too, Sakura?! This time, we fight with
our backs to each other! Lady Tsunade… I've finally caught up
with these two. So this is how Nine Tails
Chakra looks under control... A new Sharingan…
with black flames… That Naruto… He's even mastered changing
the Rasengan's nature... Sakura's holding her own! Hey, Team 8! Let's go too! We can't let Team 7 show us up! Right! I've worked out
a new jutsu too, Naruto! Don't think you're the only one
with this jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Did you just say Shadow Clone Jutsu? All you did was make one clone! Back in the day,
I could make a lot more... Just watch! There may be just one,
but he's three times stronger! Come on, Akamaru! We're gonna attack the enemy! Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast Team
Transformation Combo! Three-Headed Wolf! Sasuke's joke was disgusting.
But it's revving me up! Tail Chasing… Rotating Fang! Parasitic Gigantic Beetle... Infestation! Gross! What are those?! Parasitic Gigantic Beetles… If you mistake the amount
of chakra to give them, they'll devour your flesh
and undergo rapid growth. They are beetles
that are difficult to nurture. Two Palms! Four Palms! Eight Palms! Sixteen Palms! Thirty-Two Palms! I guess this is still my limit... No such thing. But I'm not like you, Neji… If you set limits on yourself, you'll never be able
to catch up to him… Overcome your limits,
fearlessly take a giant leap forward. That's the… Sixty-Four Palms! ...trick to achieve the Sixty-Four Palms. Naruto is always striving
to get ahead. And I… ...want to keep standing
by Naruto forever! This time, I'll proceed to Eight Trigrams
Sixty-Four Palms like this! So I'll continuously
move forward as well! Come on, Team 10! Let's attack with
the Ino-Shika-Cho Combination! Formation E! This isn't the Chunin Exam. We're not competing against
the other teams. This is war… But we want to show them
what we're made of, right? Expansion Jutsu! Shadow Grasping Jutsu! Twenty-five enemy signatures
picked up and locked on! Sensory Relay! Human Boulder Yo-Yo! I'm going to expand even more. Can you handle more weight? Yeah… You're still light. And besides, this isn't quite flashy
enough to impress. What? Who's being
super competitive now? Actually, I'm technically on
Team 7 too, you know... I'll quickly attack
the main body from the air! Sai! Sai! Are you all right?! Yes… It's no good! The enemy keeps
increasing in numbers. Not only that… Some are huge! These big ones...sure are heavy! Naruto… Can you share your chakra
with everyone again? I can't right now! Kurama hasn't finished
amassing chakra yet! In order to take down
the main body, we need to mow down
the big ones and slip past them. The distance is too great to
make a single leap for it. We also need time to weave signs
and repel the enemy's attacks. Without your chakra, Naruto, it's very likely
we'll suffer heavy casualties. And the Medical Corps
can't come up to the front. Mow down and slip past? Easy. This guy has the power to
clear the distance in a single leap and repel enemy attacks. I can now stay nearby and heal anyone who suffers
serious injuries at all times. - Summoning Jutsu!
- Summoning Jutsu! See the gigantic guy
way in the back?

 Could you get me closer
to it with a big leap?

 I need you to just
keep advancing forward.

 I'll get the real body in the back.

 Lady Katsuyu,
please divide and

 attend to each person
in the Allied Shinobi Forces.

 Our role will be to heal everyone.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The New Three."

 It is a new era!


 THE NEW THREE


 Tune in again!

 Naruto… Can you share your chakra
with everyone again? I can't right now! Kurama hasn't finished

- Summoning Jutsu! - Summoning Jutsu! The New Three-Way Deadlock

 Huh? Wait… This color… You're… Gamakichi! Pop was tied up with
some negotiations, so I came in his place. You surprised?! No! No! But man, you sure got big
all of a sudden! I'm more shocked than
I was about Akamaru! You humans grow too slow, that's all. Anyway, what's up? Right! See the gigantic guy way
in the back? Could you get me closer to it
with a big leap? You mean the biggest one
over there? Yeah. Lord Sasuke, your desire? I need you to just keep
advancing forward. I'll get the real body in the back! Sakura dear! You've finally able to invoke
the 100 Healings Mark! Lady Tsunade would be so proud… Lady Katsuyu, we don't have time… Please divide and attend to each person
in the Allied Shinobi Forces. Our role will be to heal everyone. I never expected to see the Three-Way Deadlock
Summoning again! It is a new era! Go! Go! Aoda! Lady Katsuyu, please proceed! Jump, Gamakichi! This is the original Team 7… Nice, Gamakichi! Your size isn't just for show, eh! Nevermind that, just hurry up
and weave your jutsu signs! Get with it,
or I'll shake you off my head. Even his attitude has gotten bigger! I know! What's going on? It's all right. These slugs are part
of the Fifth Hokage's Healing Jutsu. Please do not worry. My strength is being restored! My wounds are… It's healing me… Her 100 Healings Mark was
only just activated! And yet she can already perform
Lady Katsuyu's long-distance healing! Sakura… You are simply amazing! Lord Sasuke? Keep moving forward. Sasuke! Go for it! Do it! Hang in there! Aim well! You can do it! Give it to 'em! Yes! Wind Style: Massive Rasen Shuriken! Inferno Style: Susano'o Flame Control! Sasuke and I must've been
compatible, after all… Yes… Only "Wind" can beat "Lightning." No… That's not what I meant. Only "Wind" can assist
and magnify "Fire"… It's hit! It really hit! I don't recall ever seeing
a Flame Control of that magnitude. And they combined jutsu
with matching chakra ratios! That's difficult even for
a seasoned duo! A windmill-like shuriken,
and an arrow blacker than lacquer… Let's name it the Scorch Style Nimbus Gale
Jet Black Arrow Formation Zero! Nah, never mind. Burn away… You heard what
Sasuke said earlier, didn't you? What are his true intentions? I have no idea. Damn it! Why did we branch off from Sasuke? This wasn't the deal! I'm safe! No thanks to being on the frontlines! There they are. Look at the sorry state
you're in, Tsunade. Gross… A gigantic slug… How much salt would
you need to take it down? That's just one part of Katsuyu that was summoned from
Shikkotsu Woods. I'd say it's pretty small, actually. You don't say. I thought we were here
for the Five Kage, not the slugs. Lord Orochimaru,
stop paying attention to Suigetsu and get to the task at hand. Are you that upset because
you couldn't stay with Sasuke? That's totally…not the case! Let's just do this. Damn you, Suigetsu! Why are you picking on me? Doesn't everyone who sees
a slug want to sprinkle salt on it? Tsunade first! Let's go. Lady Tsunade! Wait, was the Hokage
always a granny? Ugh… It's not like she had a really
long torso either, right? It seems you were reckless, Tsunade. Orochimaru? Katsuyu… I came here to aid the Five Kage. I'm not an enemy. I have no reason to believe you. Besides, you were dead! If I do anything that
strikes you as suspect, you're welcome to kill me
once and for all with your acid. All right. I'll believe you. You're quite sensible, unlike Manda. Now then… First of all… Where are the other Kage? They're recovering inside
my fragments. They sustained serious injuries,
and it's very… But Katsuyu… With you here, why is it taking
so long for them to heal? I can only use my power
in response to the strength of
Lady Tsunade's 100 Healings. But Lady Tsunade is
extremely weak right now, so I'm not able to activate
my strength fully. Is that how the system worked? Anyway, whatever I remember,
I've never seen Tsunade so weak. So it must be true. I am trying to persevere
and focus on healing, despite the Summoning
starting to unravel. That's why I haven't been able
to properly reattach her body. Suigetsu, bring Tsunade's lower half
and join it to her upper half. Huh?! I'm better at cutting things up. Ugh… The slugs are all slimy
and wriggly. Gross! Well, so are you, Suigetsu! In fact, you're grosser and weirder
because you have a human form! Karin… Let her bite you
so that she can heal. What? I don't want anyone
but Sasuke biting me… Hah! You just admitted
you're in love with Sasuke! Huh? You're wrong! How could I hate,
I mean, like that damn Sasuke? What are you saying? He tried to kill me…
And it was irresistible… No, it wasn't! You were covered in bite marks
long before Sasuke bit you! Shut up! Right now, I'm exclusively for Sasuke. Don't be so defiant,
you denture mold model. Besides, how does
your body work anyway? You're the weird one. What? Say that again! You two… Make it snappy. You're both weird. So stop fighting. Or else… I'll have my snakes ties you up and crawl into your mouth
and possess you. You're the weirdest one
among us all! He's weird and he's abnormal. WEIRD                           ABNORMAL She's taking so much,
I might end up aging into a hag. Lady Tsunade,
you're going to be all right! Tsunade, be a little grateful to me. You betrayed the village…
So why all of this now? The range of things that
interest me has expanded. In the past, I wanted to become
the wind and turn the windmill myself. But now, I know the pleasure of waiting around for
someone else's wind. One that is unpredictable. And I don't want that wind to
get sealed away before I can enjoy it. You still don't make any sense. But…I suppose you've changed a little. I never imagined you would save me… Even that is possible. Do you remember? The Three-Way Deadlock
from that time? The summoning… No… Just like how it's written…
The Three-Way Deadlock… Earth Style Stone Pistol Jutsu! It's useless, Tsunade. The Earth Style of the Hidden Stone
will most likely cause this mountain to collapse. If we're going to escape,
we can't wait. Just the two of us. Jiraiya…too! We can't take Jiraiya
and outrun them. That's why I'll use Medical Ninjutsu to… Tsunade, this is war. We can't let our emotions
get in the way and lower the probability of success. And what is success? To survive. One alone can't. Two probably can. Three spells… certain death. Go on ahead. I'll take care of Jiraiya… Make one move…and I'll kill you. Seems like we're in
a three-way deadlock. What are you talking about? It just boils down to who will act first. Jiraiya is already… Jiraiya trusts you completely. So much so, that it might freeze you
in your tracks. So foolish! I'll…! Hey! Jiraiya, Tsunade, Orochimaru! I've brought reinforcements! People can change. Or they die before they do.
It's one or the other. Although he died without changing… He probably trusted you
until the very end. Orochimaru… If you were like this sooner,
Jiraiya might not have had to die… And if I had… Jiraiya might have changed too. Like how it was for us,
the Legendary Sannin, things don't always go
the way you want them to. We're not made of stone.
Distortions will appear somewhere. Perhaps that's why I want
to observe Sasuke's future. While patiently waiting
for his wind to blow. Fine. I thank you for helping me heal. So… Do you know about the war? Of course. That's why
I'm helping you out like this. How long have I been like this? I can report on the battle situation. How did you end up on the front? I see… Sakura summoned Katsuyu! Around now,
a new Three-Way Deadlock is probably making their debut. What? Well, we're heading back. You should work on healing
the other Kage. There is doubt in your heart.

 Won't you stop this?

 It's because of that,
I want to repudiate everything.

 I can't see you not understanding
Naruto's feelings.

 There is nothing in my heart!

 Do you really think that such things
can fill the hole in your heart?

 Just like it was with me!
Isn't that right Kakashi?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Kakashi vs. Obito"

 This is the only thing
the current me can do…

 KAKASHI VS. OBITO

 Tune in again!

 Wind Style:
Massive Rasen Shuriken! Inferno Style:
Susano'o Flame Control! No... That's not what I meant. Only "Wind" can assist
and magnify "Fire..." Burn away! You heard what
Sasuke said earlier, didn't you? What are his true intentions? I have no idea. Though still incomplete, the Ten Tails has been revived
and is battling the Allied Forces. So I think that it's become
quite a complex situation. It's gotten that bad... In that case, we need to hurry! I'll carry everyone with my sand. Please save your chakra. We came in mid-story.
I want more details! Ask about them while we're en route. Let's go as fast as we can...
to the battlefield! Kakashi vs. Obito

 Then why do you work with Sasuke? Because I exist to protect him. Sasuke! There are other Tailed Beasts
inside that huge one! Once it's weakened,
shut off your Black Flames! Then Kurama and I will
pull them out of it! No. They all burn. Hey! Don't you get it? If we don't save them now, we'll end up facing
a lot of trouble later on! I'm going to put an end to
this failing system currently in place! And then, a new... It detached the piece of itself
that was on fire! Sakura... Can I ask you something? Since I don't know him very well,
I can look at this objectively. Sasuke cannot be trusted
as a true comrade. What are your true feelings
on the matter, Sakura? Don't worry,
Sasuke has come back to us. I'm happy about that.
And I do trust him. Your words may not be lies... But... I can already tell that
your smile is fake. What's up, Shikamaru? It's nothing... Obito... Enough of these tricks... I'm over it. No more genjutsu. Looks like I can't find anything
that will change you. Right now, all I can give you... ...is death. Then I shall do the same. Come! All right! Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat! Begin! I'm going to borrow this. Fire Style... Fireball Jutsu! Earth Style... Mud Wall! The real one is here! Hand-to-hand combat is over.
Kakashi wins. Now perform the Unison Sign. Obito... Your once strong will is
still alive today, right next to me! What the current me can do
is protect the current Naruto! You will... Actually, everyone will
eventually end up just like me. Sasuke is a Rogue Ninja.
Standard procedure is to erase him. I'll bring back Sasuke! Someone who can't even save
one of their friends could never become Hokage! I'm going to surpass every Hokage
who came before me! - I'd never kill any of my friends!
- I'd never kill any of my friends! Naruto... You never waver. You're stronger than me and you have many things
that are solely yours. This is all I can do right now. And that is... to protect this world, my comrades... and the Obito of the past... by killing... the current Obito! It's over, Obito. I'll let you win... this battle. But I'm not conceding the war! I thought I told you.
I have no intention of fighting a clone. You can come at me with them,
but they offer no resistance at all. You're concentrating too much power
in your actual body. Madara... All the time, you kept
holding something back... That's... Looks like that's of no use
to me anymore. I wanted to fight Hashirama
before I became a Jinchuriki... I guess I have no choice. M-My body! It's time to make him bring me back
with Rinne Rebirth! That's...! Obito... You're just a backup that
I had cultivated for my rebirth. You saved me, Gramps? Thank you. It's too early to thank me. I intend to have you... ...repay your debt. That time is now. He's being controlled by
Madara's chakra! The Six Paths Forbidden... Rinne Rebirth Jutsu? Madara... He must not be allowed
to fully return to life! Lads! You're all closer! Stop the jutsu of the one
on top of the Ten Tails right now! Okay! Got— Sasuke! I see... So that's how it is. Is this the maximum amount
I can make inside this barrier? Tobirama! Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Only two. Is this also the best I can do? We'll just have to make do with this! They can't get to Obito in time,
so they're going to attack me... They should know by now
that I can't be stopped with clones. That's enough, Aoda!
You can get out of here! Yes, Lord Sasuke! You won't always be
like this either, right? Don't give up. You love Rin, don't you? We'll both become Hokage. Right, Obito? Sensei... Obito! That...was you? Which one is he? What a failure! But...oh well! Did they succeed?! That's Lord Fourth Hokage! He teleported a Shadow Clone. Had he marked him already? A Flying Raijin marking
never disappears. I didn't teach you that, did I, Obito? If you were alive, I would have wanted you
to become Hokage... Why did you...? That was disappointing... All that's left to do is to seal
the un-reborn Madara... and this war will be over. As well as this giant thing. What makes you think
the war is over... my fellow traitor? Dad! Sasuke! Gamakichi! Okay! What? What's happening?! Is the Ten Tails changing
form again? No, that's not what's happening! He shook off Madara's manipulation and was weaving the signs
to do this from the beginning! That's... ...the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki! Oh! I really want to know
what happens next!

 But the next episode will
be a little breather.

 It's an "Extra Edition!"

 Pain and Itachi appear again!

 Even more, Deidara and
Pervy Sage appear

 and cause a big ruckus
in the Leaf Village!

 What kind of a story is this?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 "Extra Edition: The Directive to
Take the Nine Tails!"



 Just what in the world are you?



 Tune in again!

 Extra Edition: The Directive to
Take the Nine Tails

 This should surprise
those inefficient Akatsuki. Lord Orochimaru, there's an overload! The system won't hold! It's fine! This is excellent! Yes! Now stand! Take the Nine Tails from
the child of the Fourth... I can't control it! You're going to be
the ultimate existence... ...that surpasses the Jinchuriki! W-What are you doing? I am your creator... Lord Orochimaru! After I've come this far... Please get to safety, Lord Orochimaru! Hurry! Curse that Orochimaru... Not only did he desert the Akatsuki, he stole the blueprint of
the Gedo Statue and made this thing... So this is to capture
the Tailed Beast, after all... I wasn't able to ascertain
all of its gimmicks, but I restored its movements. And added a couple
of extra features. Now this thing is ours to control. Itachi, go capture the Nine Tails. Hm? You haven't been back
to the village in ages. Don't you want to go and say hello? I'm not interested right now. All right! It's all here! The assorted offal is here! Oh, and waitress? Yes? Another plate of skirt steak
and loin meat! – Skirt steak and loin, okay!
– Oh, and these... Can you take them away? Certainly! Hey, you know, even if
this is on Asuma... I don't think it's right to start
before our host gets here. Don't worry about it. He probably stopped by Kurenai Sensei's
place and forgot all about us. Did you know that Kakashi Sensei
hasn't left Naruto's side at all? Naruto's really doing his best. For Naruto, it's more like... Ninja Art: Beast Mimicry!
Man Beast Clone! Fang Over Fang! I am not going to lose to him! Fang Over Fang! I'm ready. I can go at any time. It's because I'm tired
of being left behind. Even if I can't stand next to him... I want to get to the point
where I can follow close behind Naruto... You made Food Pills today too? I figured I'd cheer him on by giving
him some nutrition at least. You can have one if you like. No thank you... You're holding up well. What is it about him that
makes you go so far? SIT

I'm counting on you, Yamato. You have to keep the Nine Tails' chakra
inside of Naruto in check. So far, it's stable. I've got to do this! Damn it! I can't be wasting time like this. I've got to keep going... I've got to keep going... More! Go to Naruto! What? What happened?! Is everyone all right? This is... – Who are you?!
– Don't move! If that's the case, I'll... This is bad! Naruto! Huh? Please come quick! Even Neji is having a hard time! Who the hell are you? How dare you do this to
everyone in the village... You're fighting me now! Be careful. He's strong! Yes... Even I was no match for him. Yeah, but I'm in the middle
of training and I'm busy. I'm not going to waste any time on him. I'll take care of him in one blow! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here I come! Damn it! This guy's strong! Why you—! Huh? Huh? Huh? N-Naruto...? He certainly looks like Naruto. Our friend's a Mecha Naruto! Don't call the enemy a friend! Naruto! This is a one-on-one match! Hey, Mecha-Me. I don't know who made you, but... I'm not going to lose to a fake... Huh? Wait a minute. I'm not using
the Nine Tails' chakra! Hey, what're you doing?! Kakashi! I think that guy is extracting
the Nine Tails' chakra out of Naruto. If this continues... Against the enormous power
of the Nine Tails' chakra, Naruto will... This isn't good... Shadow Clone Jutsu! It's tiny! Damn it!
Mini Rasengan! I don't have any strength... Lightning Blade! The flow of the Nine Tails' chakra
has stopped. I see... In order to extract
the Nine Tails' chakra, he needs to be within
a certain distance. Then we'll draw Naruto away
from him! FOUND HIM How come...? Don't worry. Only ANBU know about
this secret underground passage. Huh?! Damn that guy! I'm not kidding! I'll pulverize him! Hey, don't get so excited! Did he find us? He's probably just attacking blindly. Let me at him, Kakashi Sensei! Otherwise, the village will destroyed! Run! You're right. He's just attacking
anything in sight. Naruto, you can't beat him. Right now, the only thing
we can do is run away. No! Look at the destruction! I'm telling you, I'll win for sure! Listen... He's not only taking
the Nine Tails' chakra! Neji used his Byakugan to
look inside his body, and confirmed what seems to be
the Eight Trigrams Sealing Formula. In other words, that thing's also
a vessel to seal the Nine Tails. He intends to suck out your chakra, weaken you,
and then capture the Nine Tails. In other words... if the Nine Tails is taken
from you, you will die. A replacement vessel for Naruto... To go through the trouble of making it
look just like Naruto is morbid. Damn! He lost sight of you and disappeared. His whereabouts are unknown, but he's sure to appear
when you show up. When that happens,
the village will become a battlefield. So what're you trying to tell me? Leave the village, Naruto! Are you getting rid of me?! Silence! Let me finish! We'll use Naruto to lure that
guy out of the village, and then bring him down. However, we can't let
Naruto get close. Can you do it? That's a tough question... But we have to do it. Naturally, we need Yamato to
control the Nine Tails' chakra. Then besides me, we'll need Sensory-type ninja
and long-distance combat specialists. Man, what a fancy palanquin! I didn't know you rode on something
so fancy, Granny Tsunade! The Feudal Lord gave it to me
for diplomatic purposes. It's not my style,
so I've never used it. Yamato, ride in this palanquin
with Naruto, suppress the Nine Tails' chakra
and don't let it leak out. Understood. But if that thing comes within
close proximity, the chakra will leak out,
no matter what I do. There's no way I'll let it get near him. To make sure that doesn't happen... – We're here!
– We're here! Shikamaru! Hey! Neji! Choji! All the members from that time
are back together again. Kiba! So? Are you surprised? Well, I knew that you'd be here, but... Um... You want to get back
to training, right, Naruto? It's a drag, but we'll help you out. How come I'm stuck in this cramped space
with you, Yamato Sensei? You took the words
right out of my mouth. We're palanquin bearers?! Listen! About this Mecha Naruto... Until you destroy Mecha Naruto,
don't even think about returning! Now go! W-What's this Mecha Naruto?! I knew I was going to be left behind again. That's because my beetles told me. It's coming! That guy...can fly?! SICK MISSILE He fired a big one this time! This is bad!
That thing is bad! Leave it to me! Shino?! That's because I've had it
with being the only one... – Shino!
– Shino! ...left behind! What?! TEAM 8 SHINO ABURAME
OUT OF COMMISSION Aw, stop it, will you?!
That face of yours!! – I'm okay...
– Stop! Stop it! I'm not sick...
I'm really not sick! Are you sure? Mid-air 150 meters! He's hurling Mecha Bombs! The forest! Run into the forest! Kakashi Sensei, switch with me! What's going on? We'll bring him down... With shadows! FOUND HIM He's going wild. Keep shooting! Come on. Come on! Shadow Possession Jutsu... Success! And now... Ninja Art! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Huh? Huh? Huh?! The shadow broke! I-I need more shadows... TEAM 10 SHIKAMARU NARA
WITHDRAWN Shikamaru... Mecha Naruto...is coming! Being in the palanquin
is more dangerous! Shizune, request assistance
from the Sand. Tell them Naruto is in serious trouble! We will not let him have Naruto! The next episode is
the conclusion!

 My comrades fell one by one
to protect me.

 You're after the Nine Tails
inside me, aren't you?

 If that's the case,
I'll fight you!

 I'll never forgive you!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Extra Edition
Naruto vs. Mecha Naruto"

 EXTRA EDITION
NARUTO VS. MECHA NARUTO



 Tune in again! Wait...! Man Beast Clone! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! I won't let you get away! TEAM 10 CHOJI AKIMICHI
SWIMMING UP A WATERFALL How dare you hurt Choji! Inuzuka Style!
Man-Beast Transformation Combo! Two-Headed Wolf! Wolf Fang Over Fang! TEAM 8 KIBA INUZUKA SUFFERS
A BLOW TO HIS EGO Choji! Kiba! Wait... Then who's in front right now? No one's there! Hold on! Are you okay?! Nine Tails' chakra is leaking! I was trying so hard not to throw up,
so I used Nine Tails' chakra... And what were you doing?! Sorry! He's coming, Neji! I was not chosen merely
 to search out the enemy... but because I have
this absolute defense! Rotation! Good! If he stays inside
your rotation, the Nine Tails' chakra
can't be sucked out! On your mark! Get set! What is going on? What speed! Wha—?! The Mecha Naruto overtook
the rotation?! Kakashi Sensei! It's so beautiful... TEAM 3 NEJI HYUGA
WITHDRAWN TEAM 7 ACTING TEAM LEADER
CAPTAIN YAMATO ATMOSPHERIC BREAKTHROUGH Let me fight too, Kakashi Sensei! If we team up,
we can take him down! No! It's not just your problem
if the Nine Tails is captured. The very existence of
the village is at stake! Naruto! My existence is at stake too! Hey! Kakashi Sensei! Sit still for a while! I'll show you the true essence
of the Copy Ninja. Can't do it... That might be...impossible. Idiot...idiot...
Are you an idiot? Damn it! TEAM 7 TEAM LEADER
KAKASHI HATAKE NOTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM Kakashi Sensei! Who the hell are...you? What are you? Nine Tails... You can talk? Give me...Nine Tails. Like hell I will! Nine Tails... I want it! Give it to me! Damn it! I don't have...any strength... I can't afford to die here! You?! I am Gaara of the Sand. An ally of the Leaf. Gaara! The Hokage should have relied
on me from the very start. Long-distance battles and
the ultimate defense... This is precisely
my kind of mission. And most of all,
machines are vulnerable to sand. Don't want...One Tails...
I want Nine Tails! One Tails is no longer inside me. However...I cannot let you
have Naruto's Nine Tails! As the Kazekage...and... as Naruto's friend! Gaara! You are so cool, you know! Sand—! Hey, if it isn't Mr. Gaara! So you're here to pick up
the pieces after the Nine Tails
is captured? Hmm? What? The Nine Tails' chakra
hasn't been extracted yet? Weren't you supposed to be
the new hope for the Akatsuki? Huh? You're a member of Akatsuki? Nine Tails... Nine Tails.
I don't want One Tails... Did you hear that, Gaara! Even the Mecha doesn't want you. How sad... So sad... Is it any wonder you lost to me and got your Tailed Beast
taken away? Hmm? You're as weak as a baby... You really need some cheering up.
Yup, yup. Gaara... Gaara...
Cheer up and smile... Gaara... Gaara... Gaara. LOVE ANGER You're dead! Sand Prison! All you had to do was give
a little squeeze... A little squeeze was
all you had to do... A squeeze... THE KAZEKAGE GAARA
DESERTED THE BATTLE I...I'm getting out of here! This is...?! The Akatsuki have some nerve! I'm the one who created this child... But they stole him. Orochimaru? Ninja Art: Snake Mouth Trap... I summoned the inside of
a giant snake's stomach. Where's Sasuke? I'm sorry... But I thought I'd settle this debt
all by myself. He was with me earlier,
but he ditched me! It's so annoying! But now, I have custody
of this child once more. Do as I say, okay? Now take the Nine Tails! If I'm able to possess Sasuke
and the Nine Tails, I will have nothing to fear
in this world! Aren't you forgetting one thing? One of the feared Legendary Sannin... ...your dear friend? Pervy Sage! Is this a rip-off of
my Toad Mouth Trap, Orochimaru? Yes... And thanks to that,
Naruto cannot escape. My child, fill your stomach
to your heart's content with the Nine Tails' honey. Long time no see! This brawl belongs to... the Toad Sage of Mount Myoboku,
a.k.a. the Novelist... Jiraiya! Let's go outside, Orochimaru! Summoning Jutsu! Ninja Art: Reversible Jutsu! What?! Digest... Pervy Sage... What happened to Pervy Sage...?! THE SAGE JIRAIYA


 THE SAGE JIRAIYA

Eventually, he'll come out
looking like that... P@@P Now then, Naruto... Why don't you hand over
the Nine Tails to me? My child! What am I going to do? What are you going to do? I can come out, you know... Sit tight a little longer. Why? Why is it...? My child has sucked up
most of the Nine Tails' chakra... You're facing a massive amount
of chakra... Why aren't you giving up? Like I told you... I can't afford to die here. Go... It's over... I can't even bleed anymore... Are you sure? Well, you're weak...
So I guess it can't be helped. It's not because
it can't be helped. I'm weak... That's why I... That's why I came back to the village
to train and get strong and... This time, for sure... This time... I'll get definitely Sasuke back. For Sasuke's sake! For Sasuke's sake... The Nine Tails' chakra... Even if that power is exhausted... For Sasuke's sake... If you think of Sasuke as a friend,
no matter what... Naruto... In the same way that
you consider Sasuke a friend, this guy shall be your friend. I'm sorry for testing you. However, if the Nine Tails
should go on a rampage, this guy will take the fall for you. Be there for Sasuke,
the both of you. This guy...is my friend The Nine Tails' tails... But I'm still in control... What's going on, my child? I am your parent...
Yet you're turning against me?! Friend... Yeah, we bonded with our fists
and know the pain of true friendship! Striking Shadow Snake! Stop! The Hidden Leaf can just...
get destroyed! A mechanical Nine Tails? A Mecha Nine Tails?! What the—?! The second destruction...
of the Hidden Leaf Village. UNITE H-Hey! Mecha-Me! I'll go... Huh? I'll go to Hidden Leaf Village. All right. I'm counting on you, Mecha-Me. When you lose to me,
and I get the Tailed Beast... our rankings will be decided! Hmm! You can never beat me! I'll just reverse it...right now! Sand Tsunami! I said it's impossible...! Naruto... Why aren't you here
at a time like this...? Naruto, hurry! Please, Naruto! It's okay! It's me, Sakura. Face open! Naruto?! You protect that flower, Sakura. And I'll protect the Sakura... who protects that flower... Did you eat something spoiled? Did you do it?! It's impossible. Mecha Nine Tails... is made with the same materials
as I am. If we hit each other,
there's no damage. Only one way to it bring down... What do we do? Use every bit of Nine Tails' chakra
inside me...and throw it at him. Mecha-Me! A Jinchuriki will die if
the Tailed Beast is extracted! You're just like
a Jinchuriki now, right?! If you use up all
the Tailed Beast Chakra... Mecha-Me... You're gonna...! Ya know... Mecha-Me! Safety device released... Nine Tails Chakra Bomb... Firing! Stop! Mecha-Me! I'm so sorry, Mecha-Me... Thank you... Sakura... I kept my promise. I protected this flower... And you, Naruto...
protected me...and the village. No... The one who protected the village is... I don't know what happened here, but... It's obvious to me that
he fought and protected the village. I'm grateful. Now you can go back to training. Yeah... Granny... I'm counting on you
to rebuild the village! Naruto! Thank you, Naruto! You guys! Oh, sorry... Hinata, did you see it?

 Yes.

 Can you tell explain
what happened?

 Yeah... The Ten Tails was completely
absorbed into that man.

 Its chakra too.

 Then, does that mean...?

 That's the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Ten Tails' Jinchuriki"


 He looks creepier than before! 


 THE TEN TAILS' JINCHURIKI


 Tune in again!


 That's the Ten Tails'...
Jinchuriki! The Ten Tails' Jinchuriki


 The Ten Tails disappeared? What's going on?
Did they defeat it? No... Hinata! Did you see it? Yeah! Can you explain
what happened? Ten Tails was completely
absorbed into that man. Based on looking at its chakra. Don't tell me... That's the Ten Tails'... Jinchuriki? What is this?! This is bad.
Jinchuriki, huh? He looks even creepier
than before! Obito... Naruto... How can you tell
he's a Jinchuriki? I've become friends
with the Tailed Beasts. They gave me some
of their chakra earlier, so it's obvious to me. I could sense the Tailed Beasts' chakra
getting sucked into Obito one after the other. Plus, I've seen Nagato do that
Six Paths Rebirth Jutsu before. But the signs he was weaving
were completely different! Anyway, he was performing
the jutsu to become a Jinchuriki
all this time. I see... Eight-o! Is that the final form? No, it's not. It's hard to explain,
but that isn't it. Looks like Ten Tails was
used to create a Jinchuriki before it reached its final form. Even if you have become
a Jinchuriki, the Gracious Deity Gates
are still in play. Whoa! Amazing! No... The Sage Art Seal that
suppressed the Ten Tails was... Such power... What?! Impossible! The Four Crimson Rays Formation! Is it just me, or is he stronger than
when he was gigantic? Before, it was just throwing
its power around. But now, it's learned to focus it. Everyone, keep your guard up! We don't know what that man, who made the Ten Tails' power
his own, might do! He's broken the barrier! Enough! Obito, stop this! O...bi...to? I'll be blunt.
This guy is stronger than me! No offense,
but it appears so. Even if you reabsorb
your remaining clones, you're no match, Elder Brother! I know. However... It would be fun to watch
all the Hokage beg for mercy, but I cannot wait any longer. Obito is now just like
the Sage of Six Paths. I can't let him take the lead
before I use my trump card. What's happened? He's so fast! Saru! Fourth! Scram! This is Lord Second's attack plan! – Elder Brother!
– Mm-hmm! EXPLODE Minato, get away! Lord Second,
you sure work fast! Flying Raijin Jutsu! I suspected that might
not be enough to kill you... I created the Reanimation Jutsu, as well as ancillary jutsu
to go with it. Though this is the first time
I'm using it on myself. There it is!
The Lord Second's special... Tandem Explosive Tags! This is how it's done! Each tag summons more tags,
resulting in continuous explosions. Concentrated and focused
consecutive explosions! This is too much!
What's going on? I can't keep up! Don't freak out! Always keep one eye on
what's happening around you! I don't care if that is
the Jinchuriki of the Ten Tails! The Lords Hokage are
engaged in battle! We have to join them! Don't be hasty! We need to—! All of you!
You must not approach heedlessly! What is he? He's solid and swift. And he has an attack that
turns all to dust in an instant! Shuriken Shadow Clones! It's similar to Ohnoki's Particle Style,
but its shape is fluid. It can shift to be either
offensive or defensive. And can be continuously maintained. I suspect it's a combination of more
than four Changes in Chakra Nature! This is more than a Kekkei Genkai
 or even a Kekkei Touta... But there seems to be
a time limit to how long he can use each
Change in Chakra Form. Gramps! Dad! You couldn't teleport
Grandpa Third with your jutsu too? It's impossible. I can't teleport
anything that I myself, or my chakra isn't touching directly. Calm down, Naruto. The Hokage are Reanimations. They intentionally attacked head-on
knowing that they won't die, in order to check out
the enemy's moves and abilities. Stop worrying and analyze
the battle instead. So that's Sasuke...
He's extremely smart. Although it still takes a while
for a Reanimation to regenerate. I'll go first and create an opening! At this point, I feel the need to... I'm done waiting, Hashirama! W-What's going on? I get it... Ten Tails hasn't completely
synched with its Jinchuriki yet. This is our chance to take it down! I'll summon my original here then! It's been a while, but it's time for my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three! Gamakichi! Below you! He passed underground!
It's just his upper body! Damn it! Sasuke... You're not the one... ...who's going to sever the past. I am! I hope this makes it in time! Flying Raijin Jutsu! My markings on Obito disappeared? Damn it! Owww... I thought we were going to die! I can't teleport anything
that I myself, or my chakra isn't
touching directly. Looks like my boy is
as accomplished as Sasuke. Now then... He's just like a snake. What is that? We have to take him down while he's still unable
to use his body well. Was he after your clone
just now, Dad? No, I don't think that was it... What? What happened?! He hit himself with his own attack. His attack missed. Seems Obito's consciousness
is merely clinging to Ten Tail's great power. He barely has any control over it. I'm glad he missed us, because if it hit us,
we'd be dead! We can't approach him carelessly. This time, I'll get the Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three in for sure! I'll create an opening, so you two hit him immediately
with your strongest combo! Rin... Of course,
I'm going to be the Hokage! Rin! And then... I won't have any time for girls! Right, Sensei? Here I come, Obito! Who...are...you? Finally, Sensei... Damn it! Dad! Naruto, focus! He got me, but I'm okay! I used Flying Raijin to escape. Are you sure about that? When did he...?! I see! He attached it to me so
it would teleport along with me! Even a small power can be helpful,

 because there may come
a time when it will be needed.

 It all depends on how it's used.

 Our power could change
the course of this world.

 We can't afford to relax and
let our guard down

 even for one second!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"An Opening"


 Shikamaru, you would make
a great Hokage.


 AN OPENING


 Tune in again!


 An Opening

 I'll have to teleport it away
with me! You can have this back. Don't worry. I only teleported a clone. I marked him that last time
we were in contact. Amazing! You can copy
my dad's move! Impressive,
Second Great Stone Face-guy! Lord Fourth is using my move! And just call me "Lord Second"! Wood Style: Wood Dragon! Get out of my way, Madara! I don't have much time, but there's something
I've got to do now! Wood Style: Wood Golem Jutsu! I'm taking another chunk of you! A-Amazing! They're on a completely
different level! So this is the battle capacity
of our predecessors! If we went out there... we would just get
in their way for sure. We're of no use in
a battle like that. Ino, please! Got it. Even a small power...
can be helpful. It's Shikamaru... We may not be any help now, but there might come a time
when we'll be needed. So don't take your eyes
off the battlefield. For if such a time arrives... our power could change
the course of this world! We can't afford to relax
and let our guard down, even for one second! That's right. He's got a point... – Yeah...
– Yeah! Shikamaru, you would make
a great Hokage. The ability to sway people's hearts
is practically a requisite of any Kage. This is just like that time... Madara, we were friends! And we shared the same dream! Hashirama! How long will you keep saying
such juvenile things? It's just not possible to show
our guts to each other! Hashirama! Madara! The end result will be
different, though... So when are we supposed
to make our move, Shikamaru? You should try to think
for yourself a little. But first, we need to figure out
the circumstances of their battle. Also... What's going on over there? Did he get him? He blocked it, huh? He's fast. We won't be able to hit him
with ordinary jutsu. I guess I'll have to make an opening with my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three... You're a bit of a comedian,
aren't you? I'd normally make fun
of your jutsu names... Except this guy we're facing
is absolutely no joke. Amaterasu! Sasuke! Naruto! I said
I would create an opening for you! I'll do it! No, we will! We'll let Dad and the others
be the main act! I could tell you were
amassing chakra in your left eye. Hardly a surprise attack. Jeez! Let's go, Fourth. A clone's Flying Raijin
is much slower. Let's combine and
reciprocate our Flying Raijin. Go ahead and put your mark on me. Yes, sir. Plus with these bodies,
we can still move after being hit! Naruto, this time, I'll match
your chakra level using my Sharingan. No need to turn it into a competition! – Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!
– Inferno Style: Flame Control! A pincer attack? You two are the main act! Distracted by what's going on
in front of you? Now! – Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu!
– Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu! – Flying Raijin Jutsu!
– Flying Raijin Jutsu! I name it the Scorch Style
Nimbus Tempest! Just keep on going as planned! So they switched places
with the Flying Raijin?! Hinata! What's going on with
Naruto and Sasuke? They're both... smiling... Smiling? Both of them? Yeah. All right! Did they get him?! I got in a direct hit before
those black things could protect him. He should have felt that one. No effect at all. We can't touch those black,
transforming spheres... Our attacks have
no effect on him... He's quick on both offense
and defense... What a pain. He's even more perfect than
how I imagine myself in my dreams! It's like he's truly obtained
dreamlike power. That's odd. What is? Your arm was ripped off... There should be dust swirling
around to restore it by now. Our reanimated bodies
aren't regenerating... I have come to possess the same power
as the Founder of Shinobi. You can no longer measure me
by the standards you are used to. Don't tell me, your jutsu...! What does he mean by the same power
as the Founder of Shinobi? Fourth... Try not to get seriously injured again,
even with our reanimated bodies... He's probably using
a jutsu based on Shadow and Light Styles
that nullify all ninjutsu. In other words, if he destroys
our reanimated bodies... we'll be unable to regenerate,
and we'll die! Also...assume that right arm
of yours is permanently gone. If that's the case, we'll need
to fight him even more carefully... But since ninjutsu won't work on him,
this will be tricky. How about physical attacks? Let's try it out. Sasuke... What? We're going to have to take the lead. Think you can keep up? Don't underestimate the Uchiha. All right! I'll up my Kurama Mode and
go into Tailed Beast State! Huh? Don't make things worse
than they already are... You're as goofy as your father. So much that even
he's dumbfounded... S-Sorry. Kurama! Lend me
a little more chakra! Hold off on going into
Nine Tails State for just a bit! But he's not someone
we can beat without it. If you want to enter into
Perfect Tailed Beast State, you're going to have to fight
in normal mode for a bit. Syrup Gun! A toad from Mount Myoboku? What was that about Gamakichi? If you're going make a move,
do something diversionary or a combo... Sorry, but we're approaching
the time limit for the summoning. I just wanted to repay him
with a parting shot! Thanks for the effort!
Go get some rest! Sorry about this. This is... Obito, I thought you wanted
to become Hokage. Why are you doing this? You want to know why? This is my chance! Lecturing me now? Isn't it a bit late for that...Sensei? You're always too late
when it matters most. Anyway, Rin and Kakashi
are surrounded by dozens of shinobi! And it looks like they're all
powerful jonin and ANBU... What is Minato Sensei doing? Who's that? I'm asking you what
the Yellow Flash is doing! Hmm... He seems to be
on a different mission. At a time like this? Rin... I want to... I want to create a world
with you in it... I'm glad my teacher was a Hokage. It made it easy to give up
on becoming Hokage. He got past Lord Third's
personal ANBU Black Ops, infiltrated a top-secret barrier, and knew that the seal on the Nine Tails would be
at its weakest during childbirth... Are you Madara Uchiha? No... That's impossible...
He's dead. Who knows? Am I? Right now, I don't care who you are... But why are you targeting the Leaf? You could say it's on a whim,
but also as part of a plan, for the sake of war,
but also for the sake of peace. If I had realized that man
was Obito, I probably could have stopped him... And then, I might have been
able to prevent Kushina from dying. I might not have had
to make Naruto into Nine Tails' Jinchuriki. If only... I had realized he was Obito... Perhaps the shinobi world wouldn't
have ended up like this either! Even though you were my teacher,
you didn't realize it was me. That's just who
you are fundamentally. How pathetic... You died a heroic Hokage, but now you're being exposed
as a disgrace in front of your son. That's right... A Hokage is a pitiable existence...
compared to what I am now. Apparently the kid's not a goofball. He's caught on! You have no right to
make fun of a Hokage when you couldn't even
become one yourself. Naruto, you—! Especially my dad...
who actually became Hokage. How dare you put him down! That worked?!
Why? How? It's effective! I knew it! Even if ninjutsu is ineffective,
Sage Jutsu still works! The toad from Mount Myoboku
used Sage Jutsu and his attack wasn't nullified. You bastard! That's amazing, Naruto... What's going on? His Sage Jutsu is working! He's even mastered the same
Sage Jutsu as Jiraiya Sensei... He's grown into quite a son, eh, Minato? It's no wonder he managed
to sweet talk my other half. Dad, I don't know if it will work,
but I've got an idea.

 Naruto, he's useless.
He can't do anything.

 He couldn't even protect
your mother.

 Nor his own subordinates.

 You know what tomorrow is,
don't you?
 
 It's the anniversary of
Minato and Kushina's death...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Day Naruto Was Born"

 The day both of your parents died.


 THE DAY NARUTO WAS BORN


 Tune in again!




﻿1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,830
Now for the main issue... Now I'm going to determine
the Buddy Teams. First, Sakura and I will be one team! The other team will be...
Naruto and Sai. <i>Me...?</i> <i>with him...?</i> <i>Captain Yamato and I
<i>will form one team.</i> <i>And...</i> <i>the other team will be Naruto and Sai.</i> Looking forward to it There's that fake smile again. <i>Damn it!</i> Captain Yamato. What is it, Naruto? Why...Why do I have to team up
with <i>him</i> ? Is there a problem? U-Understood. Good. <i>I see...</i> <i>It can't be helped...</i> <i>For the time being,
<i>you keep Naruto under control.</i> <i>Yes...</i> Um...Captain Yamato. What is it? I think Naruto and I would
make a better team. We've been working together
for a while and we know each other quite well, so. Right-right. That's my Sakura. Sakura. Yes? You're the only Medical Ninja
on this team. We can't let you get hurt, and that is why you'll be with me. You understand, right? Yes, I do. As Sai said earlier, we can assume the enemy
will be very skilled... A mistake in teamwork
could prove fatal. I'm sure you have all something
to say about this, but just concentrate
on the mission for now. Yes, sir. Got it... We don't know where
Orochimaru's hideout is. But the Akatsuki spy is probably
on his way to the Tenchi Bridge right about now. Tenchi Bridge <i>Simulation


</i> Here he comes... Aren't we ready yet...? There he is! Damn it, where's the signal?! There's the signal. Hold it! Now, Naruto. Let's go, Sai. Based on what we just talked about, although I generally don't do
this very often... tomorrow we'll devote half a day
to a team-play simulation. A simulation? That's right. All I know about you guys is
what I've read in your files. I want to get an idea of your fighting styles, battle skills
and Jutsu types... with my own eyes. And the cooperation of the team
should get smoother if we learn about each other. Uh-huh, cooperation, eh? You might think
I'm being too cautious... But this is how I do things. You <i>will</i>  go along with it. Damn it! Come at me for real! Not nearly good enough. <i>Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.</i> No way am I letting go! Wha--?! Why are you grabbing me, too?! Hey, Sai! Do something about this! <i>That way, huh?</i> H-Hey! Where are you going, Sai?! I've already captured Captain Yamato,
so hurry up and untie me! Naruto! What're you doing?!
That isn't Captain Yamato. Huh? What? What the hell is this?! Damn it! Hey, Sai! Hurry up and untie this snake! You did well to capture me, Sai. <i>I see...
<i>He's more skilled than I imagined.</i> <i>I can't believe a Shinobi this good</i> <i>was assigned to Team Kakashi
<i>as an alternate.</i> An additional member... a new recruit from
the Anbu Black Ops Training Division will be dispatched to Team Kakashi... From...the Foundation ...? However... What is it...? Keep a close watch on his actions... <i>Lady Tsunade's concerns may not
<i>have been groundless.</i> Hey, hey, hey! You creep, Sai! <i>I see.</i> <i>She has incredible strength
<i>to be able to tear that snake...</i> <i>I don't want to get hit by her again.</i> Release. All right, that's the end of the simulation. You jerk! What is it? Don't you know what
the word "comrade" is? Listen, you! I'm asking you if you know
what the word "comrade" is! Of course I do... (Comrade)
What of it? That's not what I'm trying to say. H-Hey, Naruto. Please don't blame your lack of
individual competence on others. What did you say?! <i>Damn it!</i> <i>Come at me for real!</i> If you hadn't let the Captain get
a rise out of you ... I could've remained hidden
without being exposed. And it wouldn't have been
this much trouble to capture the Captain. What do you mean? Even if you go to the trouble
of transforming into me... you'll be exposed as
a Shadow Clone immediately if you use one of your Jutsu. Because of that, the Captain saw through our strategy and escaped into the forest
using a Substitution. Then why didn't you break
the Jutsu right away if you knew it was a Substitution? It isn't ideal to fight while protecting someone who
has lost his cool. All I did was consider the best way to successfully complete the mission,
make a judgment and take action. I won't acknowledge you. I'll <i>never</i>  acknowledge
the likes of you as a comrade or as a member
of Team Kakashi! I guess these two just won't work
as a team, huh? I wonder what Sasuke would've done. Would he have fought
while protecting you? He's a Team Kakashi
comrade to you, right? <i>No good...</i> <i>Naruto won't be able to put up
<i>with this any longer.</i> If you call someone who betrayed
his village and hurt you... a comrade, that is. <i>Naruto.</i> <i>This is not good.</i> If it's to save that comrade, then I'll do whatever it takes. I'll even team up with you. <i>Naruto.</i> Why does he feel so strongly
about Sasuke? It's because Naruto...
thinks of Sasuke like a brother. You've got a brother, too,
don't you...? You should understand
a little about how he feels. No, not at all. I told you about titles for
my drawings, right? <i>To be exact,</i> <i>I couldn't title one of my drawings
<i>even if I wanted to...</i> <i>Nothing comes to mind.
<i>I don't...feel anything.</i> I have no such thing as emotions. What do you mean... you don't feel anything
or have any emotions...? I mean just what I said. Even so, if you have a brother, you should be able to imagine
what it would be like to lose him, right? Hm...? Yeah, well...
you could say that. My brother's dead, after all. Then all the more... I wonder if I should've looked like that. What're you trying to say? Well, I didn't know what kind of look
to make when my brother died... Look to make? <i>This guy...</i> That's enough talking. We're moving out pretty soon,
so gather your things. Sai, normally I would've pounded
you good back there... I told you I wouldn't hold back if
you spoke ill of Sasuke again, right? But I didn't do that because even
though you insult Sasuke, Naruto said he would team up with you
if it meant saving Sasuke. No matter what kind of guy you are... I must not hurt you if it means
saving Sasuke. Sakura, in regards to Naruto... Yeah, I guess I'd say you're nice to him. I once read something
like this in a book. I don't know why such feelings arise. Guys. Let's get a move on. This will all come to nothing if we don't get there
by tomorrow afternoon. We're almost there. We'll head for the bridge once
we're finished getting ready here. Tenchi Bridge Damn it. That spy jerk isn't here yet?! It won't be that easy.
Our opponent is highly skilled. Being overly cautious is just fine. But if we're too cautious, we might attract the spy's suspicion and our timing to capture him
will get thrown off. That's true. Shh! It looks like he's here. Took him long enough. Hey, th-that's...! No way! It can't be! He's the Akatsuki spy?! Next episode:
"The Tenchi Bridge." The Day Naruto Was Born


 Minato… You intended for your brat to
clean up after your mess, right? That's why you sealed
my other half inside him… as if you were confident they would
be able to work together. Nine Tails… Then don't regret it now. It's not your fault
that Kushina died. And making your brat into
a Jinchuriki wasn't a bad thing either. Because your brat is trying
to change... what this world has
become right now. He's not that
newborn babe anymore. In fact, tomorrow is... Naruto… Listen up... I need to
tell you something... I knew it! I figured as much. I can't believe the Ten Tails'
Jinchuriki has such a weakness! And with Ten Tails inside me,
I can't pass through things either! How frustrating! Sage moves will work! Sage Power? The toad attacks are Sage Jutsu… They use Nature Energy. Come to think of it, when I tried
to sense Ten Tails' power, it was Nature Energy itself. So you can maybe counter
Nature Energy with Nature Energy. Not that I really understand it. I'm just glad I learned
Sage Jutsu! All right! Next up is Frog Kumite! He instantly grasped how to use
the Flying Raijin with me... and has even mastered
Sage Power. I feel like I'm fighting
alongside Elder Brother! It clearly worked.
But he's recovered already, and now he's guarding his back. If we teleport behind him carelessly,
we might get erased. I should start preparing for
the Tsukuyomi. Let's tidy things up. There is nothing worth saving
in this reality. This world is already dead. Hey… This is super bad! Four of them…all at once? Even if we were to create
an Earth Style Wall, it wouldn't be enough! There are too many of them! What do we do? Think! It would take one person
per each of those to teleport away using
the Flying Raijin. The Fourth and I can get
to two of them, but that leaves two others!
Impossible! Where's Elder Brother? Madara! Could you wait a moment? Your comrade is acting up...! We are all Reanimations! There's no need to worry! Keep fighting! Do not give up everyone! I am with you!
My clones are with you! We only need to change
the spheres' trajectories! The other Hokage will
also take measures and repel them across the ocean! I ask that you all work on putting up
an Earth Style Wall! I'll use the Deep Forest
Emergence to launch and guide them to
toward the ocean! I won't let you! Six Crimson Ray Formation! A barrier! Hey! Don't tell me we're... He's trapped everyone
inside the barrier, and he's made it so we can't
expel the Tailed Beast Bombs! Endgame. Our only choice now is
to teleport those spheres outside the barrier using
the Flying Raijin. Fourth, can you handle two of them? Since we can't mark them,
I can only take one. There's only one way. We could... You intend to teleport
the stalk itself outside? You think I'd let you do that? You can't save anyone! Dad! I don't know if it will work,
but I've got an idea. Will you bump fists with me? Hey, other half. How ya been? Do you mind sharing some
of your chakra with me? To be asked a favor from myself
feels a bit weird... Naruto… Minato's useless,
he can't do anything. He couldn't even
protect your mom... Nor his own subordinates. You know what tomorrow is,
don't you? It's the anniversary of
Minato and Kushina's deaths. The day both of your parent's died. In this world, it's over
when you die. You see... Oh, right, which means... it's also the day I was born! So you see... It's not over... 'Cuz I exist in this world! Our Naruto has
become really strong... ...Kushina. Let's go, Dad! Yeah! Thank goodness for
the chakra of you two! It's just as I thought! Yeah well, the both of us
used to be one, after all. Plus...those two are
father and son. He's planning to trap us
inside this barrier and blow us up along with it! What can we do? The Hokage's barrier didn't let
Tailed Beast Bombs through either… This barrier is red all over… I think it's accurate to say that this one's likely to be
on par with the Hokages. With the level of our strength, it's impossible for us to
smash through it, in which case... Damn it!
Nothing's coming to mind, Dad! What's your plan, Naruto? Just...give me some time to focus... Let me explain what
Kurama and I came up with. You tell me if
it will work or not, okay? All right, go ahead! Have you seen him, Kushina? Our Naruto's really grown up. I'm so sorry, Naruto... I'm sure you must have had it
real tough up until now! The real tough part
is about to start, Dad! This is Naruto's…! So…it wasn't depleted?! I noticed it when
I was healing everyone, but… It seems it had merely shrunk down. It's bigger and more powerful
than before! Have ya noticed Eight-o? I sense two Nine Tails,
one light and one dark, yo! This isn't just Nine Tails. You're thinking about
protecting us from that attack with this chakra, Naruto? Jugo. Sasuke, this is looking bad.
Let's get outside of this barrier. Use the Snake
Reverse Summoning. That was my plan already. I'll take you and Naruto
with me. I haven't given you
any of my chakra yet. Get over here, will ya? What's your chakra
going to accomplish? There's no time! Just hurry! I can't believe he shared
his chakra with every shinobi! He's got almost as
much chakra as us! No! Actually, this has
Nine Tails' chakra mixed in! That won't help you
withstand the shock wave of four Ten Tails' Tailed Beast
Bombs exploding together! Begone... What? What happened? This chakra protected us again! Not quite, check it out! Choji… Look over there. We're... outside the barrier. It was the Teleportation Jutsu. Damn that Naruto!
He's even mastered that too? This isn't just Naruto's chakra. He moved everyone using
the Fourth Hokage's Flying Raijin Jutsu! Fourth… This is the second time
you've saved all of shinobi-kind. I've still failed... more times than that, so I must continue making up for it. What did you do? Dad teleported everyone
outside the barrier. Everyone? With that jutsu? I can't teleport
anything that I myself, or my chakra isn't touching,
even indirectly. How? I'd shared Kurama's and
my chakra with everyone earlier. So if Dad, and our chakra
and everybody were to uh...um... Indirectly… Right! If we were all
in indirect contact with each other, it would work. So, I connected Dad's chakra
with Kurama's and mine. That's all! He used the principle
of Shadow Clones. Even if you split up and
disperse your chakra... as long as you keep even
a little bit there without putting it out... when the original body infuses
chakra again to regain control, all the individual chakra bits
begin resonating and link together. In short, by joining his chakra
with the Fourth's, Naruto linked the Fourth
to the rest of his chakra residing in everyone else. Right, Naruto? Huh? Is that what I did? Never mind… Old Man Second, you sure know
a lot about my Shadow Clones too! I created that jutsu! It's my Shadow Clone Jutsu! Will you bump fists with me? Yeah! Yeah, let's try it! There's nothing we can't do
if we borrow Nine Tails'... I mean, Kurama's power. All right! Then let's all four of us join forces! "All four of us," eh?
You treat us like we're human too. What kind of childrearing
has led to this, eh? Naruto… Huh?! I wish there was more time... to talk to the grown-up you... Guys don't need to talk! I already know! I…already met Mom's chakra. Kushina…my time is running out… I'm going start
the Eight Signed Seal. I want to put some of
my chakra in Naruto too. It'll be quite a while before
we can see him. Let's tell him
what we want to say… Naruto… Don't be picky.
Eat lots and grow strong. Make sure you bathe
every day and stay warm. Also…don't stay up late.
You need lots of sleep. And…make friends. You don't need a lot of friends.
Just a few… Ones you can really,
really trust. I wasn't very good at it,
but keep up with your studies and practice your ninjutsu hard. Remember that everyone has
strengths and weaknesses. So don't get too depressed
if you can't do something well. Respect your teachers and
upperclassmen at the Academy. Oh, and this is important… It's about the Three Prohibitions
for a shinobi. Be extra careful about
lending and borrowing money. Put your mission wages
into your savings account. No alcohol until you're of age. Too much can ruin your health,
so drink in moderation. Another Prohibition is women. I'm a woman, so I don't know too much
about this but… All you need to remember
is that this world is made up of men and women. So it's only natural to take
an interest in girls… But just don't get hooked
on bad women. Find someone just like me. Speaking of
the Three Prohibitions, Be wary of Jiraiya Sensei. Naruto…from now on, you're going
to face lots of pain and hardship… Be true to yourself… Have a dream…and… have the confidence to make
that dream come true! There's so much…
oh, so much more… There's so much more that
I want to pass on to you… I wish I could stay
with you longer… I love you. Minato, I'm sorry I used up
your time… It's okay. Naruto, my words to you
as your father are... I guess it's the same
as your nagging mother's. What you want to say is the same
as my nagging mom, right?! I already know! What exactly is it?

 This is the Divine Tree!
Ten Tails' final form!

 Chakra first originated with
this Divine Tree!

 What?

 We humans stole chakra
from the Divine Tree long ago.

 This thing is just trying to
get it back, that's all.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Divine Tree"

 Do you know how and
why shinobi came to be, Hashirama?


 THE DIVINE TREE


 Tune in again!


 Will you bump fists with me? Yeah. Yeah, let's try it! There's nothing we can't do
if we borrow Nine Tails'... I mean, Kurama's power. All right! Then let's all four of us join forces! All four of us, eh? You treat us like we're human too. What kind of childrearing
has led to this, eh? Naruto... Huh? I wish there was more time
to talk to the grown-up you! Guys don't need to talk! I already know! I...already met Mom's chakra... What you want to say is the same
as my nagging mom, right?! I already know! This feeling is so familiar... Even though we're out of options, it feels like we can
accomplish anything... That's right! It's just like
when I was with Kushina! I feel power welling up inside me! Let's go! Naruto's got this much chakra? Naruto! Letting out a shout
and showing off is all well and good... but don't tell me
you've already forgotten... that nothing other than
Sage Jutsu works against him? I know you're not an idiot! That's right! You're a bigger idiot
than my elder brother! All that chakra and
it's being wasted on him... Or perhaps this isn't quite
the same feeling... It looks like you've surpassed
all the previous Hokage, in stupidity! Shut up! Stupid, stupid Kurama! Fools are easily liked
and trusted by others. It'll be all right.
Don't worry about it. I-I'm not worried that I'm an idiot! I'm not talking about that. Huh? I'm saying that you might
be able to go into Sage Mode while you're in that state. Listen up... You've probably
already forgotten, but during your final battle
with Pain, Nagato... I got so mad by what he was saying
that my chakra leaked out, even though you were
in Sage Mode at that time. My power and your Sage Power
actually managed to synchronize. Did something like that
happen back then...? You say that, but back when
I was undergoing Sage Training, you interfered with Gramps Sage's
Sage Jutsu, remember? That's because I had no interest
in sharing the same space with toads! Besides, it really pissed me off
that you would rely on Sage Jutsu when you had my chakra. You stubborn bastard! You're the stubborn one! Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, that I'm willing to let you use both my power and
Sage Power right now. What's stubborn about that,
damn it?! You just can't be up front about
your feelings, can you? You bastard! You've been
making fun of me a lot lately! It's not like that...
It's out of familiarity... Using Tailed Beast State with
Sage Jutsu at the same time, huh... You've got the same me
inside you as your son. You should be able to provide him
with powerful support. Yeah... I already know that! I'll have some jutsu prepared too! I'm absorbing Nature Energy
a lot faster in this state. All right! The Divine Tree

 Naruto, add Sage Jutsu
to the Rasengan! Okay! Old Man Second! Let's do it! Just forge ahead! We'll ward off his attacks
with our chakra! – Rasengan!
– Rasengan! That black thing sure is solid! Damn it... He blocked us this time! He predicted our attack... Using only the Flying Raijin
in our strategy isn't enough. Our only option is to destroy
that black thing! But how? All right, next up... Let's try adding Sage Jutsu
to a Tailed Beast Bomb! All right, excellent idea! You might just surpass
my Elder Brother as Hokage... Hey, other Kurama! You help too! I like the sound of that! I thought so... This is a familiar feeling,
after all! This is what Naruto is
capable of now? He's able to control this much
chakra perfectly... How far will you... There's no harm
in taking measures early. W-What's that?! He's starting
the Infinite Tsukuyomi already?! He spit out the Ten Tails? Be careful. I have
a bad feeling about this. I'll suspend the barrier for now. The barrier is disappearing! Now we can fight alongside Naruto
and the others! Th-This is—! What?! Run! It will absorb all your chakra
in one swoop! It's coming after us one by one! But why...?! Why...?! Why do I get so many
coming at me, huh? Fool... Ya fool! This is the tree of God.
It's called the Divine Tree! It's the Ten Tails' final form! It knows that you have
more chakra than everyone else! At this rate, the chakra that Naruto gave
to everyone is meaningless. W-What is this?! Chakra first originated with... this Divine Tree! All the chakra here... Even the enormous amounts
of chakra you possess. What? Humans stole chakra from
the Divine Tree long ago. It's just trying to take back
what belongs to it. What are you talking about?! The endless passing of time
has cast a fog over the truth. Do you know how shinobi
came to be, Hashirama? Long ago, when people didn't
even have a concept of chakra... ...even then, people still battled
each other. The Divine Tree was never involved
in their battles and was worshipped as
a sacred pillar. But one day... The Divine Tree bore a fruit
that was said to be produced only once in a millennium. I don't know what it signified,
but legend dictated that no one was to ever
lay hands on the fruit. But one princess, in her desire to reap the power of
the Divine Tree to win a war, took and consumed the forbidden fruit. Afterwards, she gained
the power of a god, and it was said she quashed
the war by herself. Her name was Kaguya Otsutsuki. So that's how! She was the first human
to have chakra. Eventually, Kaguya would bear a child who was born with chakra
already within him. However, the Divine Tree
came alive and went on a rampage
in order to reclaim its stolen chakra. That is the Ten Tails. And the one who stopped it
was Kaguya's child. His name was Hagoromo Otsutsuki. He was the one who preached
the teachings of chakra, and was the founder of Ninshu. He was the forefather of the shinobi— the man known as
the Sage of Six Paths. How do you know all of this?! It was inscribed on
the Uchiha Stone Tablet. Do I need to explain what happened to those who tasted of
the forbidden fruit... for the purpose of ending all conflict? That's right...
It didn't change anything. In fact, subsequent wars
become more gruesome! Upon learning this,
I fell into despair. There are no such things as true dreams
in this world, Hashirama! Ever since people tasted that fruit,
humans have been cursed... And destined to hate
each other even more! And it is we shinobi
whose very existence symbolizes that foolishness,
don't you think? In which case I'd rather... So relying on the power
of the Divine Tree again by using a great genjutsu... You just can't see it... What's beyond this... The dreams of the far future. Is this what you meant
by "dreams of the far future"?! Yes... But it will be a little different. Naruto! Water Style: Severing Wave! Damn it! There are too many of them! I might be able to sense Naruto,
but it's useless! Fourth! Can you teleport directly
to Naruto?! I can't! That last Flying Raijin
and these vines have drained my chakra! In that case... Let go...of me... Gramps... Sorry it took so long! Oh! Saru! All right! We're teleporting out of here! Have things finally settled down? Is this what you meant by
"dreams of the far future"?! Yes... But it will be a little different. "A little different"? Take a look... When the Divine Tree's bud
finally blooms... The moon will reflect the eye
at the flower's center, up above... and the Infinite Tsukuyomi
will be fully activated... And I...will be the one
to accomplish it. We're doomed! This is crazy... Miss Sakura! Are you all right, Miss Sakura? That was a close call, fool! Ya fool! That was too close! Is it over? Now, be still... You have all... endured plenty already. Shinobi are done for.

 There's no need to keep going.

 If you don't resist,
I won't kill you.

 Unless you want to
be filled with regret,

 stop and do nothing
from here on out.

 You don't have to fear death
or keep enduring anymore.

 You'll be entering a dream.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Shinobi's Dream"

 That is our true dream as shinobi!


 A SHINOBI'S DREAM


 Tune in again!


 W-What is that? Katsuyu! Yes, ma'am! I shall explain everything! Are you all right, Sakura...? Yeah... The Five Kage will
be here shortly. Shikamaru! Shikamaru! Hey! Hey, he looks real bad! Lady Katsuyu! Let's begin Distance Healing
immediately! That's not possible. Why?! Even my mini fragments attached
to everyone have been drained... They have lost their chakra
and died. That's... In other words... Everyone is in the same state
as my fragments. Sorry, Dad... Looks like I'll be right
on your heels... Shikamaru! Sorry... Mom... Shikamaru! Sakura! If we're going to die anyway, we might as well go down fighting
to the best of our abilities! But...at this rate... ...we'll all die before
we even get to fight! A Shinobi's Dream
 

 Shinobi are done for. There's no need to keep going. If you don't resist, I won't kill you. If you keep opposing us, you'll continue to lose
your comrades one by one! This will become a world where no one who
acknowledges you will exist! Unless you want to
be filled with regret, stop and do nothing
from here on out. If we don't do anything,
we'll be saved...? Yes... You don't have to fear death
or keep enduring anymore. You'll be entering a dream. Do not give up! If you succumb to a genjutsu,
you're no different from being dead! This giant tree is closely
connected to Obito... They're like limbs
that suck out chakra. We can't approach carelessly. Such words of weakness. So very unlike you. Sarutobi Sensei... Orochimaru... You're late... What of the Five Kage? I had them healed. So as long as they don't chicken out,
they should be coming. As sarcastic as ever, I see. Sorry I'm late, Jugo! Sasuke! You're here... This tree is huge
now that I see it up close. I wonder how long
it'll take to cut down? Who cares about that?! What's important right now... ...is to go over to Sasuke and
hug and lick him, damn it! Is to heal the Allied
Forces shinobi, right? Y-Yeah! I know
that already, damn it! He seems to be in a foul mood. What's going on? When that bud blooms,
Infinite Tsukuyomi will be complete. That's what Madara said. And yet, after depleting
the chakra of this many shinobi... the bud shows no signs of blooming. So when is it going to bloom? The Eight and Nine Tails still live. Do you get it? So the chakra of the Eight
and Nine Tails is essential to complete the jutsu... However, if it contains even a small
amount of each of their chakra, it's fine. In other words,
it's not like it can't bloom. All that is affected.... is how long it will take
to bloom. There's about 15 minutes to go. In that time, I shall stop Obito
and switch places with him. Using your Sage Power. This is bad. Everything my original just heard
must be relayed to the Allied Force. Anyone here belong to
the Yamanaka Clan?! Here! Can you do
the Mind Transmission Jutsu?! Yes, I can, sir! Good! Please link me
to everyone here! There are things I'd like to explain
about that giant tree, and the Infinite Tsukuyomi! This sensation... Grandfather! Ah! Is that you, Tsuna? This voice is unmistakably
Lord Hashirama's! This means the Five Kage
are close enough to be within range of my jutsu! Oops! We'll have to
reminisce later! I have things I must relay
to you five and everyone else! Listen to me carefully! I'll retrieve a little more chakra. It's taking too long for it to bloom. So we're just nourishment
for that tree? That's what shinobi are?! Then...how are we supposed to fight it? If there's only 15 minutes left,
it's crazy! We can't even get close to it! And yet, doing nothing will
yield the same result. We must either cut down that tree or defeat the caster within
the remaining time. But... I told you not to give up hope! That's what you say... But you're a reanimated person
from the past! Brought back to life! We're still alive! It's all...over... If it's going to end like this, we shouldn't have gotten
started at all... That's right. Just stay like that. I'll take you to a world where
there are no regrets. Naruto, are you done? Because I'm not. Let's go, Jugo. Yeah... These are... I can feel them,
these are Naruto's feelings... coming through my jutsu. Back then... I knew I should've called out to him. I thought about it over
and over afterwards. His thoughts are flowing in. That's why... This is... It's from that day... I... I... I don't want to regret anything. I never want to think,
"I should have..."! Naruto... And... I just can't make
everything we've done... up to this point meaningless! Sasuke! I'm coming too! Naruto Uzumaki... Time and time again... Sorry to have to borrow
more chakra. No worries! Naruto, we're counting on you! Hey, Sasuke... You realize that only Sage Jutsu
works on him, right?! Don't compare me to you. Look, Karin... Isn't that...Sasuke's
Curse Mark patterning? The Curse Mark is supposed
to have lost its power... Sage Power is the source
of Jugo's Curse Mark. And with Sasuke, back when I experimented with
injecting Jugo's chakra into him, he immediately unleashed
the Curse Mark. So it's not surprising
for Sasuke's Susano'o to adapt to Jugo's chakra
in similar fashion. In other words, you could call it
a Sage Jutsu Susano'o. Sasuke Uchiha, huh? He shows the same potential
that Madara once did... You Uchiha... Maybe I'll go over there too... You'll only be in the way. You'll get stabbed again. Bastard! And Sasuke... Unlike these two in the back,
your power... Rather, unlike any of my experiments... your power is nothing like theirs... I can tell... From my lifelong research
and the data I've gathered... my instincts tell me... that you'll one day be a shinobi
who surpasses Madara! And Naruto Uzumaki... You remind me so much
of Elder Brother when he was young. He's a foolish brat who spouts idealisms
at the top of their voice. And yet, everyone likes and
wants to depend on you. Aim! Gotcha! It'll be too late for regrets,
you know. Not that there's going to be
a future for either of you. Those two really
went off to fight him?! Yeah... so then what should
we all do? We can ask...
when the Five Kage get here. Is that good enough? I'm looking forward to
the battles we'll fight... ...up until the time I achieve
my true dream. What is your true dream? I thought everything we've aimed for
is here in this village! You just can't see it. What's even further ahead...
dreams of the far future. Then tell me about your dreams
of the far future. These are Lord First's memories? FIRE Dreams of the future...

FIRE LIGHTNING FIRE LIGHTNING WIND FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH WATER The fact that we were able
to convene this Five Kage Summit with the first Kage of each
of the Five Nations... truly fills me... ...with gratitude! Elder Brother! You are the Hokage, representing
the Hidden Leaf of the Land of Fire! A person like you, need not bow
to the other Kage! But...I'm so happy! Lord Hokage, raise your head... That's not becoming of
a village leader... I did indeed come here to endorse
the gist of Lord Hokage's pact, but I'm not just signing
anything for free. If you behave too humbly,
you'll make us suspicious. Distributing the Tailed Beasts that
Lord Hokage has collected to the other villages is the condition of signing the treaty. This is a transaction,
not something to get emotional over. Exactly, and we'll allocate
the Tailed Beasts based on power, but you will be acquiring them
for a price. Not for free? Shut up! This was the very first summit! Yes, and it was what would lead
to the end of minor conflicts. In our village,
a certain temple's disciples have long been sealing away
a Tailed Beast. Since we already have one,
we do not need another. Instead, we would like
an alternative compensation for our collaboration in this pact. Would that be acceptable? What do you desire? Our nation is completely
covered in sand. Thus, we'd like the adjoining Leaf to share arable land with us
instead of a Tailed Beast. And the other nations to hand
over 30% of your Tailed Beast
purchase price as well. Don't mess around, Kazekage! What—?! You overstep your bounds,
Lord Kazekage! I won't sign on unless
all of you accept these terms! Mine is a desert-locked nation
with zero fertility! It's only natural to use my village's
Tailed Beast to full advantage in dealings with
the four other Great Nations! We four nations could join up... and defeat the Land of Wind... It's true that we've never
gotten along in the past... But we each did what we did
to protect our brethren and clans. There were, perhaps,
times when we had no other choice. And now, today, even if
our Five Nation Treaty comes to be... I can't say how long it will last... or if we can even hold to it. But I have this dream, That sometime in the future... There will come a day when
shinobi will collaborate, and help each other, with one heart,
regardless of their affiliation. That is my... My dream of the future. I ask you to take the first step
toward that dream today! So please, please, please, please... I beg you! All of my, our beloved children! Now is the time to
take all the pain, the suffering, and frustration
we shinobi have endured... and weave it into Our true dream! Your past is filtering into me
through the others.

 Naruto Uzumaki,
you are uniting everyone right now.

 Your tempestuous life made you
into who you are.

 And your way of life has instilled
hope in everyone!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Pursuing Hope."

 Let's go!
Let's cut down that tree!


 PURSUING HOPE


 Tune in again!
 

 Pursuing Hope It's true that we've never
gotten along in the past...

Pursuing Hope But we each did what we did
to protect our brethren and clans. There perhaps were times
we had no other choice. And now, today, even if
our Five Nation Treaty comes to be... I can't say how long it will last...
or if we can even hold to it. But I have this dream,
that sometime in the future... there will come a day when
shinobi will collaborate, and help each other, with one heart,
regardless of their affiliation. That is my... My dream of the future. Seems like our generation no longer
needs to talk about that dream. Am I wrong? Indeed. That goes without saying. But if we don't win here,
it won't come to be! Tsuchikage is right.
Defeat is not an option. All right! We'll spread out and take command... and draw out the ultimate power
from the Allied Forces! That is our primary duty
as the Five Kage! – Scatter!
– Scatter! Sasuke! I'll keep in sync with you! Incredible... What just happened? Naruto and Sasuke are
attacking simultaneously. Did they succeed? You better be prepared... – I'll never let my comrades die!
– I'll never let my comrades die! This is...! Naruto! Even as he's fighting,
he's helping his comrades recover... Naruto! Just focus on
what only you can do! Leave the healing to me! You don't understand, Sakura. Naruto is doing this unconsciously. Huh? His chakra is acting on its own, from his deep desire to
help Shikamaru. I can sense it clearly from
my Mind Transmission Jutsu. Damn it, Naruto...
You never change. You're always going overboard... Sticking your neck out for us...
How far will you go...? All this time, you've never held back
or compromised when it came to us. In front of you, I can't complain about
what a drag things are... Sorry, Dad... Naruto doesn't want me...
to join you just yet. Shikamaru, stop talking! I‘m not letting you die! Naruto...rather, everybody needs you! Dad... I only found out later that Naruto had gone through a ton
of painful, bitter things on his own. I don't ever want him to
go through that again, or at least that's how I feel...
when I'm with him. I told you once, remember, Dad? Someday, he's going to become
a very important ninja to this village. When I'm with Naruto...
he makes me want to follow him. Unlike Lord First, that dumb Naruto
doesn't have an adept brother... like Lord Second, to be his advisor. That's why... even more so... I need to stick around so that
when he becomes the Hokage, I can stand next to that idiot. So I'm sorry, Dad...
I can't join you just yet. There's no one more qualified than me
to be Naruto's advisor. Naruto, thank you... Your chakra and the power
of your heart saved him! Yes! He's rallied! Thank you, Sakura. Thank you, Naruto. Don't overdo it, Shikamaru. You just might become
my advisor instead! Don't worry, Akamaru. It's because a Kage can have
up to three advisors. I want to stay by Naruto too. I'll have to work hard! Shikamaru! Lady Tsunade! You did well! Forgive me, Grandfather. Tsuna, don't apologize. I dragged this mess into
my grandchildren's era. My cowardice is to blame... But your heart and dreams have
also been passed down even beyond your grandchildren's era... Yes, your... Will of Fire! Hey! Why you...! All right! Let's cut down this giant tree while
he is distracted by his battle! No matter how large it may be, that tree is nothing compared
to this very earth! And the great earth,
this land is on our side! – Right!
– Right! I'm begging you! I don't want us killing each other
out of vengeance anymore! A ninja does not bow
his head so easily! A ninja values action and strength! It seems those who become Hokage
like prostrating themselves, but... As an act that relays one's heart, perhaps it can lead to strength
and be meritorious too. Let's go, everyone! Okay! Double lariat time, bro! Yeah! – Here we go!
– Here we go! As a woman, I mustn't get
a late start on battle... All right, everyone. Let's go! – Right!
– Right! Damn it! Naruto... You have truly become a necessary
existence to this world... What the two of us had
always wanted to be. And you will now save
the entire world, Naruto! – Everyone, follow me!
– Everyone, follow me! – Let's go!
– Let's go! All right, I think I should
get going now. The springtime of my youth…
hasn't ended yet! Let's go, Lee! Tenten! – Yes!
– Right! Your past is filtering into me
through the others. Naruto Uzumaki, you are uniting
everyone right now. Your tempestuous life made you
into who you are. And your way of life has given
everyone's hearts hope! Let us pursue hope! Onward! Let's do it! Let's go! Let's cut down that giant tree! We samurai must not waver either! Go forth! Let's go too. Are you okay though, Shikamaru? Yeah, I'm fully recovered. But what if that tree robs us
of our chakra again...? Now that we know,
just have to be careful. Fourth, I'm going to use the link
between your chakra and Naruto's. I can't move simultaneously like you, but I'll still help protect them
all with my Teleportation Jutsu. Orochimaru... Are you just going to spectate? I have no interest in this war. However, this dream of Obito's would
lead to the elimination of this, my precious laboratory... So I suppose I cannot support it. Then lend me a hand. Fine then. I'll partake in a bit of nostalgia... and participate in some
student and teacher teamwork! I'll shift to a more offensive form! What is it?! Do not panic! It's coming! Huh?! What? I'll use my Teleportation Jutsu
to whisk anyone in danger away. So go forth without fear! It's the voice of Lord Second! We can give it our all.
It's because... Still, don't get careless! With two 100 Healings adepts,
we can likely summon one-tenth of Katsuyu's actual body here
from Shikkotsu Woods! We'll mold Katsuyu into
the Allied Force's entire footing, into a Healing Area where one can
be restored just by standing on her. Ready, Sakura? Yes! – Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu! Ino! Have you relayed that to everyone? Yes! Huh? What's that going to do? Is this it?! This way, we can fight without
our chakra being stolen! Oh, this is great! So this is the Healing Area?! If you understand,
quit playing around and get going! Where's Naruto? Damn it! He really is fast...! But... I'm starting to sense him
better and better! – Right there!
– Right there! It's about time that you go to sleep. I'll guide you into the dream. There's no time left! Obito... I bet you really did want
to confirm... whether a heart that never bends and
a Will of Fire that does not waver... are truly possible. You gave up on them once. But after fighting Naruto
and hearing his words... deep down, you're not able to deny
that they might really exist. Isn't that right, Obito? And yet, you still search and test everyone and everything
to prove yourself wrong. Which is why even now,
as you stand at the precipice... Huh?! What?! What is that?! What was that just now?! Naruto and Sasuke are... But wait...! You seek the answer...in Naruto. Why do you get up?! And what are you fighting for? Is it for your comrades?
Or is it for this world? Listen, friends will eventually betray you. And this world transforms love
into hatred. You should know! In the past, the people of the village
and Sasuke betrayed you. And your love for Jiraiya
made you hate. You and I are the same. The cumulative weight of all
your suffering will change you in time. And now, even more pain
shall assault you. And you still insist that
you will not change?! You don't know when your friends
will betray you again... Or if the Allied Forces might
go back to fighting each other. And you don't even know
if you can defeat me! There is no reason to keep on
fighting for a world like this. In a few minutes,
this world will be gone anyway. Why do you still fight? Because it's my Ninja Way. I never go back on my word. That's my Ninja Way. I thought I told you to go to sleep! Let's settle this with
our next move, Naruto! Right! We'll sleep tomorrow,
dreaming our own dreams! Obito...when people see someone
trying twice as hard as others,

 they instinctively start wanting
to lend a hand.

 That's because people
eventually learn that

 they only have each other to
fill the holes in their hearts.

 And he who possesses
a heart filled with comrades...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Heart Filled with Comrades"


 ...is truly powerful!


 A HEART FILLED WITH COMRADES

 Why do you get up?! There is no reason to keep on
fighting for a world like this. In a few minutes,
this world will be gone anyway. Why do you still fight? Because it's my Ninja Way. I never go back on my word. That's my Ninja Way. I thought I told you to go to sleep! Let's settle this with
our next move, Naruto! Right! We'll sleep tomorrow,
dreaming our own dreams! A Heart Filled with Comrades


 The Susano'o is... That's... I believe this is what
Madara did once before. This is... Naruto and Sasuke? Nothing you try now
will change anything. Look above you... What can you see through
that hole at the top? I can see what Obito sees... and hear his voice. It's resonating. The moon. The time to enter
the moonlit dream world nears. The gaping hole of hell
that has opened will be filled by the moon's dreams... That time is finally here! Look! There's nothing in my heart! I don't even feel pain anymore. Reality is cruel... This hole will only keep growing larger. How will you fill this hole
by staying in this world? This sword is the divine blade
of the Sage of the Six Paths... the Nunoboko. You can no longer defeat me. Strong emotions dwell within the blade. It's a sword of the soul. The Sage created the world
with this blade. Hey...did you feel that... just now? Yeah... Tenten, isn't this...? Yeah. Let's go, Lee! He's calling us. My desire will vanquish you all. No matter how much you resist,
it's useless. The power of the Sage will stop you. Sasuke... Let's focus everything on
a single blow. I think we're only gonna have
a tiny window to strike. Don't miss it. And I will use this sword
to obliterate this world! Obito... Even if it's someone
they used to make fun of... when people see someone
trying twice as hard as others, they instinctively start wanting
to lend a hand. That's because... people eventually learn
that they only have each other to fill the holes in their hearts. I'm giving a Rasengan
to each of you! Use it to blast through his shield! This, right? Can I really do this? You can! And he who possesses
a heart filled with comrades... is truly powerful! Go get him, everyone! Why am I... seeing such images...? Just like we thought! The chakra you received
from the Tailed Beasts earlier reacted to the Tailed Beast Chakra
inside him and you were able to pull it all out
in one shot! Yeah! This wouldn't have worked if the Tailed Beasts hadn't taken a liking
to you back then and shared their chakra with you. I only told you how to stop me. I never told you how to save me. You should have told me that
from the beginning! Why aren't Tailed Beasts
more straightforward?! So what are you gonna do? Before I tell you,
I have something to pass on to you. What? Hold out your hand... Huh? You're giving me something? It's something good. It will come in handy one of these days. Hurry up! We assembled here
on Four Tails summons... And hung around after promising to tell
and give you something. Oh, he said something like that? I'm glad that you're all gathered together
and getting along! That only happened after Four Tails
and Roshi left here. It's all thanks to you, Naruto. Naruto, step forward
and extend your hand... We shall now fulfill
our promise to Four Tails... rather Son Goku. My name is Matatabi. Yugito Ni'i... My name is Isobu. We've met before, huh! I'm Yagura,
the former Fourth Mizukage. I am Kokuo. I'm Han. Me, I be called Saiken. You already know me, I'm Utakata. I'm Lucky Seven Chomei. I'm Fu! Naruto... You really are something special... Now! You know what to do next, right, Naruto? It's a tug-of-war! Just pull the Tailed Beasts' chakra
right out of him! Yeah! Damn! I guess it won't work with One Tail
and Eight Tails because we never got their chakra. One Tail used to be linked to me. I'll get him. Gaara! Come here, Shukaku! We finally found a weakness,
that's the key! You can leave Eight-o's chakra to me! Octopops! Let's do this, Bee! Don't lose! Extract them! Then the only power he'll have left
is the Ten Tails' shell! And the Divine Tree's bud
will not bloom! They've stopped... Which means... he's lost control of the Divine Tree! In other words... Everyone... Remember when I said that
even a small power can be helpful depending on how it's used? Now is the time! That power will change
the course of this world... Listen closely. It's because your chakra
is connected to his! His feelings will flow into you,
but don't let them distract you! Don't underestimate
the power of the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki. I'm equivalent to
the Sage of the Six Paths! Just keep pulling, Naruto. Naruto! You're the one
who asked us to lend a hand! So we're helping out until the very end! Guys! And that's not all... Everyone! Grab onto my chakra! This one? All right! Everyone, we'll do it together
on my mark! Pull! Are you saying… That I… I've got regrets...?! You once told me... "I'm nobody.. "I don't want to be anybody..." Stop! Don't come into my thoughts! But the truth is... You wanted to become the Hokage,
just like me. It could have even ended up where
I was chasing after your shadow... since I've always wanted
to become the Hokage. I threw away the past
and my naïve self! So don't tell me I'm— Then why am I able to see this? You can't hide behind a mask. You were Kakashi Sensei's friend... my dad's subordinate...
an Uchiha like Sasuke... and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf
who had the same dream as me. What... What exactly... do you want with me?! To remind you that
you are Obito Uchiha. I told you, didn't I? I swore I'd tear that mask
right off your face! Obito Uchiha?!

 What meaning is there in that name...
in that existence now?

 Now that I've merged with the Ten Tails,

 I've transcended and
attained enlightenment.

 In other words,
I am no longer human.

 I am the one who will lead mankind
to its next stage.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Obito Uchiha"

 I am the Second Sage of the Six Paths!


 OBITO UCHIHA


 Tune in again!


 You told me... "I'm no one...
I don't want to be anyone..." Stop! Don't come into my thoughts! But the truth is... You wanted to become
the Hokage, just like me. It could have even ended up where I was chasing after
your shadow... since I've always wanted
to become the Hokage. I threw away the past
and my naïve self! Then why am I able to see this? You can't hide behind a mask. You were Kakashi Sensei's friend... my dad's subordinate... an Uchiha like Sasuke... and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf
who had the same dream as me. What... What exactly do
you want with me?! To remind you that
you are Obito Uchiha. I told you, didn't I? I swore I'd tear that mask
right off your face! Obito Uchiha


 Obito Uchiha? What meaning is there
in that name... in that existence, now? I have merged with Ten Tails. I have transcended and
attained enlightenment. I am no longer human. I will guide mankind to
the next stage. I possess the same will and body
as the Sage of Six Paths. I am the Second Sage
of the Six Paths! Wrong! You are Obito Uchiha! When our chakra touched earlier,
I saw your past. Our personal histories and our dream of becoming Hokage
are the same. Almost exactly alike. Neither of us knew our parents. And we both lost people
precious to us. Which is why you tried
to scare me by saying solitude is
my worst nightmare. In the beginning, you too wanted to be acknowledged
and praised by others! That's why you wanted
to be Hokage... If you're the same as me, that is! But look at you now! You've turned all shinobi
into enemies and you go spouting
some nonsense that you're doing it for
the sake of the world... when you're only doing it
for yourself! No one... not even those
precious to you would ever acknowledge
this current dream of yours. You used to have
the same dream as me. But now you've become
the exact opposite of a Hokage! It's because you're just
like me that... No, it's because of that.... That I wanted to see you despair
about this world. Or...I suppose I wanted
to feel again for myself, that the path I have chosen
for myself is not a mistake. When I was fighting you,
you made me recall my youth. That's why I started wanting
to test you. To see when you,
someone who's just like me, would fall to despair... and abandon your feelings, your past. It's because we were so alike
that I'm pissed off! You're just...abandoning everything
and running away! No... What I'm doing is no different
from a Hokage's actions. In fact, I'm doing even more... I can make peace a reality. Are you really serious? Do you really believe that? You know, Rin, you saving me... is really the same as
you saving the world. Hmm? I mean... It's because I'm gonna become
the Hokage and end this war! For me to do that, I have to stay strong and
healthy in this world. You get what I'm saying? Yeah! Though you're not
making much sense... So...how do I put it...? If you don't stay close
and keep an eye on me... I mean... Well... Y-You got so close all of a sudden! Don't scare me like that! You just said to stay close
and keep an eye on you? Yeah, I did. So watch over me. I'm going to wear the Uchiha crest... And definitely become the Hokage! Okay! Yes... That's how I feel. There's no need to voluntarily tread
a steep and rugged path, not knowing what's ahead. You'll have to step over
the corpses of your comrades. Anyone would choose a shortcut
with a fixed outcome. Yes. The goal a Hokage should
seek is world peace. What the hell are you talking about? What I want to know about
isn't a shortcut... but how to navigate
the steep and rugged path! Would you still say that
if the final destination... were the same? Who can tell in the beginning
which one is the dangerous one? You never know until
someone starts walking. The Hokage is someone
who endures the pain and takes the lead in front
of everyone... So a Hokage never walks
over his comrades' corpses. There is no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage! And there are no ways out for
the one who becomes Hokage! Isn't that right? Oh man, oh man, oh man! This is the one day I can't be late! ENTRANCE CEREMONY Where should we go? I don't know, where should we go? Where do you want to go? It's the entrance ceremony
and you're already late... Someone like you has no business
being in the Academy. You'll never make it. It's okay. NINJA ACADEMY
ENTRANCE REGISTRATION I got this for you. F-For me? Yes! Just submit this and
you'll be able to enroll. Thank you! You're a lifesaver! Keep pampering him and
he'll never be cured of his tardiness. Shut up! Do you wanna fight? Say that again! What?! It's your fault! What did you say, Kakashi?! A perfect score of 10! Wow, amazing! Hey! Are you trying to kill me?! S-Sorry! Begin! Stop right there! Y-Yes! Um...um... What is it, Obito?
I didn't call on you. That was so funny! He's so weird! Kakashi's taking
the graduation exam? Yeah! But he's the same age as us. He's brilliant,
so he's skipping a level! He should be taking
the exam just about now. Damn it! – Wow!
– Wow! It's amazing! What's with that headband? You passed! Congratulations! Yeah... Aren't you going to congratulate me? As if! I'll catch up to you in no time! Just you wait! Obito... Class is starting. Let's go. Rin... Keep... Keep watching over me, okay? Huh? I... I'll catch up to him! Then I'll surpass him and... I'll become the Hokage,
no matter what! Yes. Don't worry, I'll be watching. All right! I'm gonna do my best! No good... It's no good.
Of course I totally failed... Damn it...
I still can't catch up to him... What do...I say to Rin? So there you are! You just dashed out
of the classroom. I-I'm sorry. I looked all over you.
Here you go! Don't tell me I...? Congratulations! From today,
you are a full-fledged shinobi. I did it! However...! The difficult days as
a Genin are just beginning! Y-Yes! Hereafter, you will be part
of a three-man squad. Each cell has a Jonin in command and you will fulfill
your missions as a team. Excuse me. You wanted to see me? I want to ask you a favor. The one who just left... Isn't he Kakashi Hatake? Yes... The White Fang of the Hidden Leaf... Sakumo Hatake's orphaned son. Is there an issue with him? Kakashi Hatake is
an extremely talented shinobi. However, he fusses too much
about sticking to the rules and clashes with his superiors
and teammates. He may excel in technique, but as a human
he has much to learn. His father broke the rules
to protect his comrades, then took his own life... His death has cast a shadow
over Kakashi. And you want to place him
under my supervision... I know what you want to say. But our village has lost
many Jonin and Chunin due to the long war. I can make an allowance
only so much, and I must send
the young ones to war. I understand. Goodness! How long will
you keep me waiting?! I beg your pardon!
He'll be here shortly. As usual, he's late. Don't worry. He'll be here. You're too easy on him, Rin. Sorry I'm late! Rin? You're late! Damn it... It's always like this. What did you say?! Whoa... Okay, cut it out. Mr. Genzo is tired of waiting!
Hurry and line up. All right. Look this way! It's a commemorative photo.
Look at the lens! You just couldn't throw away
the memories of my dad,

 or Kakashi Sensei,
or this Rin person, could you?

 You tried to run away from
every single thing.

 I bet this Rin person would say this
if she were still alive...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"I'm Always Watching"

 "I'm always watching," you know.


 I'M ALWAYS WATCHING


 Tune in again!


 I'm Always Watching

 What the heck... Minato Sensei tells us to assemble
and he's the one who's late! Give me a break... You're one to talk! What did you say? Eh? Come on, you two... Want to do this? Hey! Did you just scoff at me? What of it? Sorry to keep you waiting. You're all here, I see. Minato Sensei!
Do we have a new mission?! Not today. What is that? They're applications. I recommended you three
for promotion to Chunin. Minato Sensei... You're awesome! Hey... Don't jump the gun. Huh? You have to take
the Chunin Exam first. What... There are three parts
to the exam and each one is quite difficult. Oh... Are you kidding me? You'll never pass since
you can't even make it to a rendezvous on time. What did you say?! Hey, you two! Anyway... You've worked together and earned the right to take
the Chunin Exam. That's why I recommended you. However, it's not compulsory. Whether you take the exam
or not is entirely up to you. I wouldn't miss it...! CHUNIN EXAM
PART ONE Aw man! This is a Chunin Exam, so I was expecting stuff like
ninjutsu and taijutsu... But this is a written test...
the kind I'm weakest in! Finished already? Yes. Th-That Kakashi...! Aw man, I'm done for... Huh?! I'M ALWAYS WATCHING YOU
-RIN Rin... RIN NOHARA There it is! I did it! KAKASHI HATAKE Well... What did you expect? That was just a written test! Just wait and see!
I'll find my name! END OF LIST I guess not... Obito! Look! There! THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN
ACCEPTED DUE TO A VACANCY
OBITO UCHIHA I did it! A vacancy, huh...
That's so like you. What?! Come on, you two. You don't have time
to celebrate! If you passed,
go to your assigned classroom! We'll explain the second part
of the exam. Part Two will commence
three days from now. This will test your physical skills. Use everything you learned
about taijutsu and ninjutsu... to get through this exam! All right! I got this! However, this test pits
your team against others. Huh? It's not
an individual competition?! Kakashi! You'd better not
drag us down! Right back at you. What?! Will you two stop it?! Especially...don't be late. I know! CHUNIN EXAM PART TWO
TEAM COMPETITION Kakashi Hatake is also
participating in the test, right? Yes, he's on the next team. Ah, I'm looking forward to this. KAKASHI OBITO RIN
GUY EBISU GENMA
IBIKI HAYATE TOKARA Team Minato,
you have five minutes left. Will he make it?! Yes! I'm sure he'll be here
in a minute. If time runs out,
you'll be automatically disqualified. I knew it! Didn't I tell you?! You're too easy on him, Rin. That's why he'll never break
this habit of being late! He'll be here. Something must've happened
to delay him. He'll make it in time. I wouldn't be so sure. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Here, have some candy. 3:00 pm. It's time to begin. Damn it, all because of him! I know he'll... I'm sorry I'm late! See! I told you Obito would make it,
no matter what! Hurry, before we're disqualified! Oh, boy! We will now begin part two,
the team competition... Preliminary qualifier! Begin! Fire Style! Fireball— CHUNIN EXAM PART THREE
INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION I'm going to have you pay me back
in full for the last time. The "last time"? What?! Don't tell me
you don't remember?! Who are you? What did I do to earn
your wrath?! Why you—! Don't take me for a fool! Do your best, Obito! All right... Just watch me! Begin! Huh?! The winner is Might Guy! What is he doing? Do your best! Go...! Kakashi! Stop! The winner is Kakashi Hatake! He did it! You passed the Chunin Exam
on your first try. Kakashi, you're amazing!
Isn't he, Obito? Humph. Obito... So this is where you were. O-Oh, it's you, Rin. It's only natural
that Kakashi passed. But we can too, I know it! Let's practice hard
for next year! But it's hard to get motivated
after watching Kakashi... What are you saying?! You're going to be Hokage, right? I'm always watching you! Yeah! Obito? I did it! I'm a Chunin now! Congratulations! Meet me later at the park
under the cherry tree. Today for sure... I'm going to tell Rin
how I feel about her! Sorry I'm late... – No...
– Everyone! Everyone? Why? Uh, Why... Why is everyone here?! I asked them to come
to discuss the gift. Huh? What gift?! Well, Kakashi is being promoted
to Jonin. So, we're going to...
give him a present. CLASS PROJECT
GIFT FOR KAKASHI'S PROMOTION
TO JONIN
(TOP SECRET MISSION) Kakashi's a Jonin? Oh? Didn't you know, Obito? It's something to be proud of
as his classmates. Yeah... What do you think
Kakashi would like? Well... Since we're talking about him, it should be
something useful. Now we'll do combat training. It might just be training, but if you're not alert,
it can be fatal. Understood? – Yes!
– Yes! Well...I guess that's it! Show me your left hand! Hey, it's nothing... It's just a scrape. A little spit will take care of it. Whatever! Just show me! I messed up... I got some sand in my eyes and... A scar or two on a man
is a badge of courage! I was just thinking how
I needed that. So this wound's... Ouch! Don't act tough and
hide your wounds. I'm always watching you. You promised me that you would
become Hokage, Obito. Listen, I want to stop this war too. I really want to save the world. So I decided to stick by your side
and watch over you. You told me saving you was the same as saving
the world, remember? Yeah... Since I'm keeping an eye on you, you can't hide anything
from me anymore. Okay! Okay! Go for it, Obito! Become Hokage and show me
how you'll save the world. That's another promise! Let's go! You... You told Kakashi Sensei
you would throw away all your memories and feelings
about your comrades. But when you became
the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki and were about to
be taken over by it... Didn't you try to suppress
the Ten Tails because you didn't want that? The reason why you beat
the Ten Tails and could control it was because you stood firm
on not throwing away the past and stayed yourself, right? You just couldn't throw out
the memories of my dad, Kakashi Sensei or
this Rin person, could you? That's how you could stay Obito even after you became
the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki. Am I wrong? But dragging everyone with you
onto your path and continuing on it
won't be allowed! I'm bringing you back
as Obito Uchiha... as a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf... and you're going to atone
for your sins. You tried to run away
from every single thing. The only thing that awaits you... is your personal nightmare. Solitude! So why keep living in reality? Now come join us, Naruto! I bet this Rin person would say this
if she were still alive... Don't act tough and
hide your wounds. I'm always watching. You're no one else but you,
damn it! Don't run away! Come join us... Obito! I will never go over to your side!

 I have no regrets with
my path up until now.

 I told you I saw everything.

 Then don't keep imagining
yourself as Hokage!

 The person Rin wanted to
watch over isn't the current you...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Promise That Was Kept"


 It was Obito Uchiha!


 THE PROMISE THAT WAS KEPT


 Tune in again!


 The Promise That Was Kept


 I will never go over
to your side! I have no regrets with
my path up until now. I told you I saw everything. So… don't… keep imagining yourself as Hokage! The person Rin wanted to watch over
isn't the current you… It was Obito Uchiha. We're late again because
of you…Obito. Let's go, Obito. Sorry! We'll be right there. Rin… That's right… You ought to fill in that hole
in your heart yourself… Others will be of no help. So…come over here. I won't ignore you. Come… Come… Obito… Hold on, Rin! That's right… Rin won't even turn
to look at the current you. The one Rin wanted to watch over
is Obito Uchiha. Enough already… I am… Obito Uchiha! Now just come over, you bastard! Everyone's power… Don't you dare underestimate it! They're out! – All right!
– We did it! – We did it!
– We did it! Yes! Did I…lose? The gaping hole of hell
that has opened will be filled by
the moon's dreams… There's nothing in my heart! I don't even feel pain anymore. Don't feel so guilty, Kakashi. This hole was opened
by this hellish world. Do you really think that
something like this can fill that hole in your heart?! Don't erase the memories
of the real Rin! Rin sacrificed herself to protect
and save the village! You can try and fill that hole
with delusions all by yourself… But that hole will never be filled! The hole in one's heart gets filled
by others around you. Let's go. Rin… You kept your promise,
Naruto Uzumaki! That's why I want
to save you too… And you really rescued us! Right, Son! We were lucky. He did it. For real. You're right. I'm so glad! Isn't he…? H-Hey! Wait, Sasuke! Where is he?!
Where'd he go?! Over there! He's still alive! Right…I've lost… Kakashi! Sasuke, we'll talk later. I apologize for appearing
so suddenly… But I was once
his classmate and friend… So please let me
take responsibility for him. Kakashi Sensei! He's now—! Dad! He's weak now! Now's the time to finish him! Let's go! – Right!
– Right! Hold it! Obito… When we had that
chakra tug-of-war just now, I got to see inside your heart. It seems like my son nagged
and lectured you quite a bit. I think he might have gotten that
from his mother. Dad… But that duty actually falls…
on you. I think the one who truly
understands Obito and should talk to him… is you, his friend…Kakashi. Isn't that right, Naruto? Naruto, you two and
the Allied Forces should go and help Lord First,
and seal Madara away. Oh, right! We still need
to deal with him! Let's go, Sasuke! I think you were younger
than Naruto is now. Do you remember? All the missions that
the four of us went on? As a Medic Ninja, Rin did
her utmost to protect you two. She would never have wished
for a situation like this. But what caused this
is my responsibility. Can I start explaining
the mission to you? We're close to the border. All right, it's this line. It shows where the Land of Earth
is currently invading the Hidden Grass Village. Hidden Stone Shinobi
are our enemies… We have received intel
that 1000 ninja already make up the front line. They've advanced farther
than last time. The Land of Fire shares borders
with the Hidden Grass. We should have stepped
in long ago. Judging by the size of this advance… they must have an efficient system
for reinforcement. Hence, our mission is here…
at Kannabi Bridge. To crush one's enemy
at the battlefront requires an immense number
of ninja. So shinobi like us,
who focus on sabotage missions, are forced to work in small,
select teams. The bridge…you say? Then it's an infiltration mission? Team Kakashi… Your mission is to infiltrate
the enemy's rear territory. You will destroy this bridge which is used to transport supplies
and reinforcements. And when this is done,
withdraw immediately. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! And you, Sensei? I will face the enemy directly
on the battlefront. I'll create a diversion for you. In any case,
Kakashi is your captain today. We'll travel together to the border, but after that
your mission commences! – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! We'll be splitting up into
two teams from this point. Good luck to you all. The enemy the other day was
doing surveillance alone. But here on out,
we'll be fighting teams. Be careful… Let's get going, Captain. It's no coincidence that I,
who should be dead, am standing before
you two like this. Perhaps it was Rin
who made it happen… Her way of scolding me
for failing as your teacher. I'm sorry I couldn't protect Rin. Rin… Rin was my only light and hope. After I lost Rin… The world as I saw it, changed. It became a pitch black hell. There's no hope in this world. I took Madara's identity
and walked the world. But all it did was confirm my belief. Even with my Sharingan,
I couldn't see anything… There was nothing to see. I don't know anything
for sure either… Then…my new path is—! Without a doubt,
your path is just one of many. And it may not actually
be wrong either. I've thought this world was hell too. I thought that you had died… And right after that, I lost Rin… And I lost Minato Sensei as well. But… Oh yeah… I forgot… I was the only one
who didn't give you a gift… for becoming a Jonin, Kakashi. I was wondering…
what to give you… and I just had a thought. Don't worry… It's not some useless,
extra baggage… I'm giving you…my Sharingan. Whatever the village may say, you are a great Jonin. That's how I really feel… So please accept it. Even though I don't know
anything for sure… I tried my best to see
the world with this eye. I felt that as long as I had
your Sharingan and words… I could see it. And what you saw is Naruto? How can you be sure
his path won't fail? No… He may very well fail too.
Of course. How is Naruto different from me? Why do you go so far for him? Because I can say
without hesitation that he is less likely to fail
than the current you. Why is that?! Because if he trips and stumbles
on his path… I'll help him. Why would you help him? He would never give up
on his dreams…or on reality. That's the kind of guy he is. Found him! And the way he forges ahead
draws others towards him. He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble. And the greater
the support behind you, the closer you can get to your goal. That's the difference. Massive Rasen Shuriken! Bigger! We'll go with something
even bigger! – Right!
– Right! Do you really believe
such a thing is possible in this pitch-black hell? I'm sure you could've seen it too,
if you had tried. After all,
you and I have the same eyes. If comrades that you trust,
gather around you… hope can take physical form
and become visible. That's what I believe… Obito. Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

 Seems you've become friends
with that Fox Demon's brat, Gaara…

 If you're not going to help,
let's talk later.

 I'm going.

 Sand Shinobi human,
are you a friend of Naruto too?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"My First Friend."


 We'll help you too!


 MY FIRST FRIEND


 Tune in again!


 My First Friend
 

 He would never give up
on his dreams, or on reality. That's the kind of guy he is. And the way he forges ahead
draws others towards him. He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble. And the greater
the support behind you, the closer you can get
to your goal. Naruto's path… Take this! Massive Rasen Shuriken! If comrades that you trust,
gather around you… Hope can take physical form
and become visible. That's what I believe, Obito. Perhaps… That Wood Dragon will absorb
your chakra! Your chakra-stealing ninjutsu
has now been nullified! In other words, you can't move nor will you be able to extract chakra
with your next ninjutsu! Good timing, son of the Fourth! Let's get him with this
and seal him away! Naruto aimed his attack over there,
so that's where Madara is! Naruto, this way! Let's go! Thanks, Sai! Don't waste any time! Now's our chance to seal him! We won't let Naruto's attack
go to waste! Right! Without any orders…
without a single word… Everyone is galvanized into action… Naruto… And I'm one of them… Shukaku… I'd like to borrow the power of
your Sand to seal Madara. You mean,
the Grand Sand Mausoleum? That's right… A giant one too. I'm not bound to a Jinchuriki anymore. What makes you think I'd listen
to you after all this time? I'm not ordering you.
I'm asking you. If you refuse, fine. I'll just ask one of the others. Naruto Uzumaki, huh? Seems you've become friends
with that Fox Demon's brat, Gaara… If you're not going to help,
let's talk later. I'm going. That tone you're using ticks me off! As they say, if a fox has
seven tricks, a tanuki has eight! And I, the Demon Tanuki,
will not lose to a stupid fox! I'm not doing this
because you asked! I'm doing this because I want to! Lead the way. It's this way. Now then… Wait up. Huh? We'll help too. That's why I want
to help you too… Don't worry.
We're not doing this on a whim. We want to help Naruto. I'm grateful. Sand Shinobi human,
are you a friend of Naruto too? It's a monster! Stay away! Use the buildings as a shield! But do not go inside! If they collapse,
you'll be buried alive! Are you all right? Yeah… That's my kid brother? H-He's just a—! Hello! Hello! Hello… Run! W-Wait…! Help! Don't leave me by myself! I hate it… I hate it! People hurt others and
others hurt them… That's how they learn to survive. But it's not that easy for
one person to hate another… It's not bleeding, but… it really hurts right around here. That is a wound of the heart. It's a troublesome wound that
only the love from another can cure. Love? Love is a feeling that desires to serve a precious person
who is close to oneself, to love and watch over
that person… Die! Don't get involved with him. Stupid! Don't look. Get lost! Your name is Gaara… A demon that loves only itself. One that loves only itself
and fights only for itself. Because you were never loved. He's just a monster! D-Don't you feel anything? Kankuro… They were our friends! You killed…friends from our village… Don't you feel anything… right here?! Doesn't your heart hurt?! If you don't shut up, I'll kill you. I was a killing machine
from the time I was born… An uncontrollable monster… My mother died giving birth to me… The village ignored me…
my siblings avoided me… I was made a target for
assassination by my father… I was alone… And a solitary weapon
didn't need a heart. Then I was sent as a weapon
to destroy Hidden Leaf Village… where I met him. Let's go. Hey, you there… What's your name? Gaara of the Sand. I'm curious about you too. What's your name? Sasuke Uchiha. Hey! Hey! And what about me? I'm not interested. Naruto Uzumaki… My first encounter
with him was uninteresting. However… I'm definitely going to win! But with every little incident, his words and actions
towards his friends began to send ripples
through my heart. Why you! What were you trying to do
to Bushy Brows! I was trying to kill him. If you get in my way,
I'll kill you too. As if someone like you
can kill me! I keep telling you to cut it out! This guy has monster-like strength. I have a real monster inside me. I wouldn't lose to a guy like him! Furthermore, he started to
have an effect on me… He wasn't like the others
who merely aroused hatred in me. Just what are they to you? He's my friend! If you even attempt to hurt him,
I'll pummel you! A friend?! Don't make me laugh… I only fight… for myself! Because he resembles me… Because he has gone through life with the same loneliness
and sadness as I have… That guy who continued to fight
in solitude for himself, I thought he was strong. But that's not the meaning
of true strength… If one fights just for oneself
in solitude, one can't become truly strong… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Na-Ru-To! 2K Uzumaki… Barrage! There's no way… I can lose…
to a guy like him! The more I drove him into a corner,
the harder he fought back… Summoning Jutsu! Transformation Jutsu! Get up, you jerk! Time and time again… after hitting rock bottom… Die! You bastard! Why…? What kind of strength
does he possess? Why? Why do you go so far for others? Because they are my precious friends
who saved me from that hell, of being alone, and who acknowledged
my existence. Love… Is that why he is so strong? This day would come to
hold special meaning for me… I learned that he grew up
under the same circumstances as me, yet he chose
a different way to live… And that my strength was
directly connected to this. I just have to work hard and
carve out a future for myself. And I must not run away
from my path of solitude. If I do that, someday… I can be like him. So as a shinobi
who belongs to the Sand, I will aim to become the Kazekage. In order to connect with
this village and live in it. Gaara… Watching Naruto Uzumaki
makes me feel this way. A connection with others… Until now, that only meant hatred
and a desire to kill. So just what is this connection
that he keeps talking about? After all this time, I understand
a little bit about something… Suffering and sadness…
even happiness… can be shared with someone. Naruto Uzumaki… He has known
the same suffering I have… And he has taught me that it is possible to
change one's path in life… I, too, want to become the kind of man
that everyone looks up to… Instead of just being
a weapon to be fearful of. As the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand. I was able to take a step forward,
away from my pessimistic life. And I became the Kazekage. I have gained more friends, and I continue to strive to be
someone who is needed by others. And with my head held high,
I stood as his equal, and step by step, I aimed for the day when
I could be acknowledged as his friend. However… Whose…hand is this? Oh…it's my hand. Have I become someone
who is needed by somebody? Huh? What is this? It's me? That's me… I really wanted to be needed… Why? Why did I desire that? Why am I someone
who desires that? Those eyes…
that nose, that mouth… Why? Why is that Gaara? I was inside that… No… Actually just what am I? That's what I feel I am… But actually…what am I? Just a small feeling? Gaara… Gaara! Who is that? Who are you calling? Who is it? Who's hand is this? Oh… It's just my hand again… My hand… Me? Who am I? I… I am… When the Akatsuki extracted
the Tailed Beast from me… I died, but was revived… thanks to Granny Chiyo who used a Forbidden Jutsu
to exchange her life for mine, and Naruto's chakra. So long. Right! Normally, people shake hands
when they part. But I'm not so good with
stuff like that… So… I thought I've been doing my best in order to be accepted
by you as a friend. I thought I had to become someone
who was essential to others… someone people looked up to… But… But on that day, we… came to understand,
and accept each other… We were already friends. What's wrong? I asked if you are Naruto's friend? Yeah… He's my first friend. Is that right? All right, let's hurry. I'm curious about what happens
next with Gaara…

 But the next episode is
a little extra feature.

 In the Hyuga Clan, Hinata and
Hanabi were very close sisters!

 But the destiny of hatred
within the Hyuga

 caused their feelings
to pass each other by.
 
 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Adored Elder Sister."
 
 Can't destiny be changed?
 
 
 THE ADORED ELDER SISTER


 Tune in again!
 
 
 The Adored Elder Sister
 

 Elder Sister Hinata! I've been waiting for you! Let's play ninja! I'm sorry, Hanabi.
I can't right now. Huh? Come on,
just for a little while! That will not do, Lady Hanabi. Lady Hinata must train
with Lord Hiashi. I will play with you. Please be on your way. I'll see you later, Hanabi. No, no! Elder Sister! It's so boring… It can't be helped. Her ladyship is the successor
of the main family. But just a little can't hurt… We Hyuga are an illustrious clan
within the Hidden Leaf, who possess Byakugan, the most touted
of all the Kekkai Genkai. As the leader of the clan, there is a mountain of knowledge
that Lady Hinata must learn. Here you go. Lady Hanabi! Lady Hanabi! Now where did she run off to? I found Elder Sister! I didn't get to play
with Elder Sister today… Elder Sister Hinata! Sorry I'm late. No problem! Huh? Elder Sister came yesterday. She must have been exhausted
from all that training. Did you thank her properly? Well… She fell asleep,
so I'll tell her next time! Yes, please do that. What's the big idea?! What're you doing here,
you're a curse on all of us! What? I was only… I was only looking at the masks! You want this? You filthy loser? You disgust me.
Just take it! You can have it.
Now get lost! Hey Natsu, who is that boy? Well… It's as the shopkeeper said. What?! Why do you all look at me
with those eyes? You must never approach him. You're going to your studies? Yeah! I can write my name now. I even know some kanji! Actually lots! Really? Lady Hinata, you mustn't keep
Lord Hiashi waiting. Right. I'll see you later, Hanabi. Okay! Training, huh… Please focus. You can't go out to play
unless you finish. Done! Here! My, my… So strong…yet so kind. I want to be like her… I want to be more like Elder Sister,
even just a little bit. Elder Brother Neji? Her sparring partner
doesn't have to be me. Please let me do my own training. No, not yet. Continue. Please, let's continue, Neji. Understood. That guy's different today… What's wrong, Lady Hinata? This isn't child's play. Hang in there, Elder Sister! That's so… That was nothing… And you expect to fulfill
your destiny… As the leader of the Hyuga Clan? What? Ahhh… My head… My head…! The fool… What's…going on? What was that? What was that? You were peeking into
the training hall, weren't you? I see… That man was fine,
then suddenly, he was in agony… And the pattern on his forehead… What you saw was
the Curse Mark: Caged Bird… passed down within the Hyuga. The Curse Mark…Caged Bird? Yes. It reacts to the hidden seal
placed within the main family… If it is placed on you, they can easily destroy
your cranial nerves. So back then… When Neji threatened
Hinata with harm, Hiashi used the power of
the hidden seal to stop him. Why would he do such a thing? The main family of the Hyuga Clan
has the solemn duty of protecting the Byakugan
for eternity. For that, there are times
when we must rule over the side branch families
using absolute fear… in other words, "death,"
to keep them in line. Absolute fear… Naturally, some in the side
branch families oppose this. I speak of those
who harbor resentment towards the main family. But regardless of how much
we are hated, it is all for the sake
of the Hyuga Clan… that we possess this skill. So that's who we are... Listen well, Hanabi. All of us are born into this world
bearing our own destiny. In our lifetime,
that destiny never changes. How unusual… You're not in a rush today? Yeah… Not today… I wonder if that guy is way stronger
than Elder Sister? That's inadequate! Why did you hesitate right there?! Drive in, as hard as you can! Yes! Thank you very much. Is Hinata up to this? By her very nature, Hinata is not very good
at confrontation. Perhaps she is too kind. If that's the case,
she can't protect the Hyuga! TRAINING GROUND 3 What is she doing
in a place like this...? Clone Jutsu! Clone Jutsu! Wasn't he the one…? Why is Elder Sister watching him? Elder Sister? I'm entering. They're supposed to
be five years apart in age. Lady Hanabi is quite amazing… How was training today? The same as usual… You seem depressed. You used to have
so much fun in the past… Yeah… I observed for a while… It's going to be difficult to let Hinata
succeed the main family. A decision must be made. I understand. However, I'd like to make
one request. You two will participate
in a mock battle today. Huh? I want to see all the skill and power
you've gained until now. Do not go easy on each other. Fight with the intent
to defeat each other! Fight with the intent to defeat? What is Lord Hiashi thinking? Hinata… You are the successor
of the Hyuga Clan. Show me that
you are worthy of that. Yes. But I'm just supposed to fight… Begin! Elder Sister Hinata! They're both amazing! There's no end to this! Right there! Oh no! Stop! Father… To fall to Hanabi who is five years
younger than you… Enough. You may go! Hinata will probably serve
the village as a genin. I see. As sad as it seems, we cannot allow a failure like
that to be our successor. This is her destiny. That you were born
possessing strength surpassing that of your elder sister
is also destiny. Hanabi, you must hone
your skills to the utmost for the sake of the Hyuga. Yes. CLEAR MIND Stand, Hanabi. Hinata will be under
my command from now. But are you sure about this? Hinata is the successor
of the Hyuga Clan. Genin missions carry
a high risk of death. Do what you will with her. She couldn't beat Hanabi
who is five years younger… The Hyuga have no need
for such a person. Father has turned his back
on Elder Sister. Is that all you wanted to discuss?
If so, you may go. We are busy here. All right. Continue, Hanabi. Yes. If Elder Sister can't do it,
I have no choice but to do it. I will protect the Hyuga. This is my destiny! It seems Lady Hinata is doing
very well as a genin.

 I hear she will be taking
the Chunin Exams.

 The Chunin Exams?!

 It's a test one must pass

 in order to be promoted from
genin to chunin rank.

 But I understand it's quite rigorous,
and there are even fatalities.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hanabi's Decision"


 There's no point in participating
in something like that.


 HANABI'S DECISION
 

 Tune in again!
 



﻿1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,270
Tenchi Bridge I don't sense the presence of
anyone around the Tenchi Bridge... I guess that means there won't
be any Akatsuki ambush, huh...? All right! Then let's proceed
as planned. Right! Naruto. Could you take this and
hold it towards me? All right, that's good.
Hold it towards me. Wood Style: Transformation! So? Did it turn out okay? Yes, it did! You look like Sasori's puppet
Hiruko in every way. Now I want to adjust the voice.
Let me know when it sounds right. Yes, sir! Oh!
That's it. That's the voice. Then we're going to start
the operation, okay? Your tone is too polite. You need to sound more violent
or surly or something... Oh...That's right. I'm irritable, and hate waiting
and being kept waiting. Okay, we're starting the operation! Right-right.
That's what he was like! Okay, our opponent should be
on the alert. We'll split up now! Observe teamwork at all times!
Especially you, Naruto! Don't be jumping out before
I give the signal! Let's go! <i>Okay...Time to go.</i> <i>The wind's strong. This should...</i> <i>Sakura...</i> <i>Yeah, this spot should be okay.</i> <i>It's almost noon...</i> That spy jerk...isn't he here yet? Is that him? <i>The Tenchi Bridge


</i> Here he comes. <i>At midday in ten days,
<i>go to the Tenchi Bridge</i> <i>located in
<i>the Village Hidden in the Grass!</i> <i>I've got a spy working as one
<i>of Orochimaru's subordinates...</i> <i>I was supposed to
<i>rendezvous...with him...there...</i> <i>That's him, huh...?</i> <i>Captain Yamato...
<i>I hope you do okay...</i> It's been a long time, Lord Sasori. <i>He's...</i> It's been five years, hasn't it? <i>Kabuto Yakushi...</i> Were you followed...? We're okay... How're you doing? I've still got the strange sensation... from when I remembered who I was
after your Jutsu broke... I still feel heavy-headed... Him again...?! Who would've thought...
the Akatsuki spy was Kabuto. I've got some questions for you. I don't have much time,
so please keep it short. I risked my life to get here
without Orochimaru finding out. I want information about the location of his hideout
and Sasuke. There are several hideouts. We move to
a different hideout each week so as not to get discovered. Of course there are hideouts, not just in the Village Hidden
in the Sound, but in other lands as well. Spies for Orochimaru infiltrate
and act as informers. But there are all sorts of
means of transport, so they're not easily tracked... Where is it now? We're now in a hideout on a small island on
a lake to the north. We'll be moving again in three days. Sasuke Uchiha is there as well. The sound of the wind is so loud
I can't hear anything. You idiot! That's why we were
able to get this close. The wind blows away the noise and
smell, so we can sit here unnoticed. By the way... Oh...it's just a wild rabbit. By the way... About what you ordered me to do,
Lord Sasori... <i>Uh oh...</i> <i>I still had a few more things
<i>I wanted to ask him</i> <i>while I had the chance, but...</i> <i>I'll be discovered if the conversation
<i>continues any further...</i> Even after his reincarnation, Orochimaru uses a Jutsu
to apply a protector to the cellular specimens
from his discarded body... And therefore I was unable
to analyze the cellular data. I see... What's he doing?!
He should just grab him! His opponent is Kabuto. Being overly cautious is just fine.
It's all over if he gets away, right? But... The spy could get suspicious
if he's too cautious... and the timing to capture him
will get thrown off. We'll... just have to believe in
Captain Yamato about that... Now, please hand over
the item in question immediately. I can't be hanging around here
any longer. If it's discovered that I'm here
with you like this... I'll be killed. Okay... <i>I can't hold out any longer...</i> <i>I just have to capture him
<i>here and now!</i> That conversation sounds interesting. Would you guys let me
join in as well? <i>He was followed!</i> Orochimaru! <i>That's...?</i> If you hadn't pulled out
a Kunai Knife, I wouldn't have been able
to get away before I noticed. <i>It looks like he's
<i>misunderstood nicely...</i> <i>I guess I still haven't been
<i>discovered for now...</i> <i>But...now that Orochimaru
<i>has shown up...</i> <i>What should I do?</i> That outfit...sure takes me back... Sasori... Did you follow Kabuto? Oh... I just thought I'd thank you. This kid you sent to me...
has come in very handy. The number of human subjects
necessary for the development of one new Jutsu is over a hundred... Thanks to this kid's Medical Ninjutsu, I've been able to reuse
test subjects several times. There's been a great shortage
of them, you see... What do we do?! We just have to stand by until
the Captain gives us instructions. <i>It would probably be
<i>impossible for me</i> <i> to take on Orochimaru alone...</i> <i>But even if I can stop Orochimaru
<i>by working together with Kabuto...</i> <i>he'll find out immediately that
<i>I'm not Sasori by my fighting style...</i> <i>Even so, if I call those three...</i> <i>then Kabuto will find out
<i>who I am</i> <i> and it will become difficult
<i>to capture him...</i> <i>Either I have to immediately call
<i>the three and defeat both of them...</i> <i>or retreat as is without calling them...</i> <i>I'll have to do one or the other...</i> <i>Have I been discovered?</i> <i>No... that's not it...</i> <i>What's the meaning of this?!</i> Multiple Striking Shadow Snake! This is a Substitution created
with the Wood Style Ninjutsu... You... could it be...? Lord Orochimaru.
Is this Sasori's real body? No... It isn't... Kabuto... you didn't know
his real face even though you were
his subordinate? He was a broody guy
who always stayed hidden inside his puppets, after all... What's the meaning of this...?! Kabuto... you were supposed
to be an Akatsuki spy... Weren't you caught in one
of Sasori's Jutsu all this time?! Lord Orochimaru...broke that Jutsu
for me ages ago... I can't believe you went
to the other side pretending to be caught
in one of Sasori's Jutsu... Did you get caught in one
of Orochimaru's Jutsu...? No... that's not it. I just empathize with
Lord Orochimaru's ideas. By the way, who are you? The plan was to take
care of Sasori. But something has gone
quite wrong. Kabuto... I'll tell you
about this kid later... More importantly... Why don't you call the three
little mice behind you over here? <i>So he's seen through
<i>everything, huh...?</i> <i>There's the signal!</i> You again, huh...? I've seen that face often... And it looks like
the Nine-Tails kid's here, too... Maybe I'll play with you guys a little. Let's see who's gotten stronger,
you...or Sasuke. You're starting to become more like
a Jinchuriki aren't you, Naruto. That's...! What kind of... Chakra is that?! The air stings.... There's no mistake.
The Nine-Tail's Cloak...! That's the Jinchuriki's power? I can tell just by the feel of it. This...This horrible Chakra... It's not a Chakra quality
that can be controlled! So this is Naruto Uzumaki's...
The Nine-Tail's power...! Next Time:
"The Nine-Tails Unleashed" Hanabi's Decision
 

 I was born with strength that
surpasses Elder Sister's. This is my destiny! That's why… I must get stronger…! More, more, more…more! Look at all your injuries… Couldn't you be overdoing it a bit? No such thing. I must protect the Hyuga Clan. Oh, that's right! It seems Lady Hinata is doing
very well as a genin. I hear she will be taking
the Chunin Exams. The Chunin Exams? Yes. It's a test one must pass in order to be promoted from
genin to chunin rank. But I understand it's quite rigorous,
and there are even fatalities. There's no point in participating
in something like that. Lady Hanabi… Lady Hanabi! Terrible news! HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL I heard Elder Sister Hinata
was seriously injured! She's been treated and
is conscious now. There's no need to worry. She should have expected
this outcome if she faced Neji. Why didn't you withdraw? I couldn't…do that. I know very well what I am. I'm an indecisive failure… But I don't want to give up,
I want to become strong… I feel like I can possibly change. Watching Naruto makes me
feel this way. Naruto… What're you doing here?
You're a curse on all of us! What? I was only… I was only looking at the masks! Clone Jutsu! I never go back on my word. Because that's my Ninja Way. No one has inherited the blood of
the Hyuga more intensely than he… Watch carefully, Hanabi. Yes, Father. What is it about this Naruto
that Elder Sister so believes in? But look at how he's attacking
Elder Brother Neji. Elder Brother Neji is
the genius of the Hyuga… There's no way a failure
can beat him. I'll win, no matter what! Gentle Fist Technique:
Eight Trigrams 64 Palms… Eight Trigrams… Two Palms! Four Palms! – People are born burdening
– Eight Palms! an inherent destiny – that they cannot go against.
– 16 Palms! – You can't possibly understand
– 32 Palms! the destiny of burdening a mark that cannot be
wiped off for life! 64 Palms… He's been overwhelmed. All his chakra points have
been shut down and he can't even infuse chakra. I knew it… You are destined to lose to me…
no matter what. I won't know that until I try! You loser! I won't run… I'll stand by my own words. I won't lose to someone
who blabbers on about fate, someone who keeps
running away! I don't know what
the Hyuga destiny of hatred is! But if you're going to say it's futile,
you don't have to do anything! After I become the Hokage… I'll change the Hyuga! The winner is Naruto Uzumaki. That kid won against a Hyuga! Seriously? You are destined to lose to me…
no matter what. I won't know that until I try! No… That was definitely just a fluke! But I thought Elder Brother Neji
hated the main family? Honestly, I didn't think you'd come
and help me train. You're probably right. But he taught me something. That destiny can be changed. Elder Brother Neji! Okay, let's continue. Right! But he taught me something. That destiny can be changed. Destiny can be changed? So that's, all of us… Bear this in mind, Hanabi. All of us are born into this world
bearing our own destiny. In our lifetime,
that destiny never changes. I am who I am. I only have to keep
aiming for the top… Once more, please. This rotation is a ninjutsu
that is only passed down orally, and is known only to the Hyuga. It's not something that
you can master easily. No, I will have it down shortly. I can't afford to get stuck now… I have to get much, much stronger. I couldn't master it, after all. I'm telling you it's true! Naruto was amazing! He pummeled Kakuzu,
the guy with all those hearts… with a super go-get 'em new jutsu! "Go-get 'em"?
Isn't there a better description? Well, It was huge and
just whizzed by… He called it the Wind Style
Rasen Shuriken! He wove together Wind Change
in Nature with Change in Form? Yeah, I think that's it! Awesome! Naruto keeps getting better. I'll have to do my best too. That could be a hint
for a new jutsu… Are you talking about the time,
just recently, when Naruto crushed the Akatsuki? He wasn't impressive
at all three years ago, but he's gotten stronger and stronger. Yeah, now everyone in his generation
aspires to be like him and have progressed steadily. Rotation! Not again!
Why can't I get it right?! Let's call it a day. Please allow me to continue. Next time, I'll get it for sure! You cannot master this
by rushing through it. Sometimes, it's best to give it
time to let it sink in. It's unusual to see Hanabi
have such a difficult time. Yes… Technically, she should
have no trouble… Perhaps something else
is the problem. I have to keep going! I have no choice
but to keep going! Why? Your form is looking quite good. Yes, well… I can't fall behind Naruto! Why am I…? It shouldn't be the same
as that time… Why hasn't she given up? She was called a failure and
Father turned his back on her… And yet, she looks so happy. Nice! Can you stay like that and
transition to Change in Form? Yes! Don't tell me she's on the verge
of mastering a new jutsu?! So strong…yet so kind. I want to be like her… Elder Sister? Lady Hanabi, how was
your first diplomatic outing? Going outside the village walls
made me nervous, after all. But you did very well. The Taketori Clan has long been
a close ally of the Hyuga. It is important to maintain our ties
in your generation too, Lady Hanabi. Yes. A moment please… Lord Hiashi Hyuga and
his party, I presume? What is it? I am a border guard. We just received word
of an emergency. The Akatsuki are attacking
the Leaf Village. What?! Make haste! We must return
to the village at once! This is terrible. Hidden Leaf Village has been
destroyed beyond recognition! What happened to everyone? Lord Hiashi, thank goodness
you're all right! This destruction… How many fatalities were there? By some miracle, no one died. That can't be! Not this with
scale of destruction… It's true. Naruto protected everyone. But only because of Lady Hinata. What do you mean? The village was attacked by
Pain of the Akatsuki and was on the verge of collapse. And at that point, the only one
who was able deal with Pain… was Naruto Uzumaki. – But even Naruto…
–…the world – was pushed to the limits.
–…bastard! I guess I'll be taking you now… And the one who rushed into action… was Lady Hinata. How cruel… Restricting Naruto's movement
with those poles. I won't let you hurt
Naruto anymore! I know… I'm just being selfish. What are you talking about?! Don't put yourself
in danger like this! I'm here because I want to be. This time… I'm going to save you, Naruto. I was always crying,
and giving up before even trying. I made the wrong turns
so many times… But you helped me find my way
and take the correct path, Naruto. I always chased after you. I wanted to catch up to you. I wanted to walk beside you
all the time. I want to be at your side, always. You changed me, Naruto! Your smile is what saved me! That's why I'm not afraid to die… If it means I can protect you! It's because… I love you, Naruto! Lady Hinata protected Naruto
and fought until the end… Gentle Step… Twin Lion Fists! As a result, she overturned
the unfavorable situation that we were in. Hinata did that, eh? So Elder Sister used that jutsu. It was such a surprise… I couldn't believe that Hinata
was capable of so much… I bet Elder Sister was never
a failure, after all… Elder Sister Hinata! But I don't want to give up,
I want to become strong… I feel like I can possibly change. Watching Naruto makes me
feel this way… I never go back on my word. Because that's my Ninja Way. Yes… I can't lose to Naruto…! She simply chose the path
she should take of her own free will. And she got to be this strong… She changed her destiny… Elder Sister always remained herself. Kind and strong… The person I love very much. Father, I have a request. I know you will be busy
with rebuilding the village. But when things settle down, will you train with me once more? I have a feeling
you'll master it next time. Yes. I want to be like
Elder Sister Hinata someday. And choose my path on my own,
without being told by anyone. Now hear this! We are now on the brink
of the Fourth Great Ninja War! We will capitalize on
our Sensory skills and divide up to support
every battalion! We must guide them
to victory in this war! – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! Hanabi, take care of things. You can count on me. I've made up my own mind
to protect the Hyuga. More than that, please careful,
Elder Sister Hinata. I will. I'm going to throw everything
I've learned at them. I will protect Naruto! Do your best, Elder Sister Hinata! Yes! It's now my turn to attack!

 Stop acting tough!
The war's over!

 I'm grateful to you, Naruto…

 You even extracted
the Tailed Beasts from Obito,

 saving me the trouble
of weakening him.

 Finally, I can fight for real!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Madara Uchiha Rises"

 It's not a battle without raging blood
and a pounding heart!

 MADARA UCHIHA RISES


 Tune in again!


 Are you saying... that I... have regrets? You told me, "I'm no one...
I don't want to be anyone..." But the truth is... You wanted to become
the Hokage, just like me. You can't hide behind a mask. You were Kakashi Sensei's friend... my dad's subordinate...
an Uchiha like Sasuke... and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf who had the same dream as me! You used to have
the same dream as me. But now you've become
the exact opposite of a Hokage! It's because you're just
like me that... No, it's because of that... That's why I wanted to see you
despairing about this world. Or...I suppose I wanted
to feel again for myself, that the path that I have chosen
for myself is not a mistake. There's no need to voluntarily tread
a steep and rugged path, not knowing what's ahead. You'll have to step over
the corpses of your comrades. Anyone would choose a shortcut
with a fixed outcome. Yes... The goal a Hokage should
seek is world peace. What are you saying? What I want to know about
isn't a shortcut... but how to navigate
the steep and rugged path! Who can tell in the beginning
which one is the dangerous one? You never know
unless you start walking. The Hokage is someone
who endures the pain and takes the lead
in front of everyone. So a Hokage never walks over
his comrades' corpses. There are no shortcuts for
the one who becomes the Hokage... There's no running away
for the one who becomes the Hokage! Isn't that right? I messed up... I got some dust in my eyes and... Oww! I bet this Rin person would
say this if she were still alive... "Don't act tough and
hide your wounds." "I'm always watching." You told me saving you was the same as
saving the world, remember? Since I'm keeping an eye on you, you can't hide anything
from me anymore. Okay! Okay! Go for it, Obito! Become Hokage and show me
how you'll save the world. That's another promise! Rin... Rin was my only light and hope. After I lost Rin... the world as I saw it, changed. It became a pitch-black hell. There's no hope in this world. I took Madara's identity
and walked the world. But all it did was confirm my belief. Even with my Sharingan,
I couldn't see anything... There was nothing to see. I'm sure you could've seen it too,
if you'd tried. After all, you and I have
the same eyes. If comrades that you trust,
gather around you... hope can take physical form
and become visible. That's what I believe... Obito. Naruto's path, huh... Madara Uchiha Arises

 Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates!

Madara Uchiha Arises

 Naruto's jutsu didn't bring him down, but with this,
he won't be able to move at all! All that's left is to wait for
the Sealing Shinobi. Having the Tailed Beasts
extracted from him means that Obito's... The Ten Tails' Jinchuriki aren't
like all the others. They won't die if
the Tailed Beast is extracted. It's because the Ten Tails' husk,
the Gedo Statue remains. It contains a lot of life force. Is that true? How do you know? Hey, now. Who do you think scattered us
all across the world after splitting Ten Tails' Chakra
into nine pieces? The Sage of Six Paths... But with nine bodies extracted out
of him all at once, he'll be so weak it will
be like he's dead. He won't be able to move
for a few months. Just as it was for
the old man back then. So that's how it goes. Kakashi... the Tailed Beast inside me
just explained to me... That's right... Rin won't even turn
to look at the current you. The one Rin wanted to watch over
is Obito Uchiha. So you don't have to worry. Then...his life is... I was hoping he would atone
for all his past deeds, but... It can't be helped if you can't move. Just stay put. Sensei, please keep an eye
on Obito. All right. What are you trying to do? The same thing the man
I once tried to use... did to betray me. No way... I never imagined I'd end up
doing the same thing... It's the Gedo... Art of Rinne Rebirth. But that jutsu will result in your...! It seems to be a jutsu
that trades life for life. I feel like I finally understand
why Nagato… betrayed me back then. A string of hearts linked together
like prayer beads... That can be a strong power
as well, huh... Nagato and Naruto were
both Jiraiya's students. So you could say
Jiraiya defeated me. Sensei... He was also your master, the one who groomed you
to become the Hokage... And I...was your student. A shinobi who gave up
on becoming Hokage... and cut all his ties. I won't have much to say
to Rin on the other side. Are you sure about this? You could live and atone
for your sins... No... That's the easy way out. I'll help you out this time! Time to switch places! It's now my turn to attack! Stop acting tough! This war is over! – Sai!
– I know! Sealing Jutsu! Crouched Tiger Bullet! Naruto... I'm grateful to you. You even extracted
the Tailed Beasts from Obito... Saving me the trouble
of weakening him. Sorry, Obito... This is the reason
why I was stuck onto you. Black Zetsu!
W-What the—?! Okay! Just a little bit longer! – Art of Rinne Rebirth!
– Art of Rinne Rebirth! Finally, I can fight for real! This is the form,
the body I needed! It's not a battle without raging blood...
and a pounding heart! Ancient relics... should just butt out! A brat who doesn't even
come close to my level. You stole my line. Why did he close his eyes? Sasuke! It's pointless to just
throw attacks at him. This guy can absorb ninjutsu! It is these two polar opposites
operating together that give rise to all things
in this universe... Hashirama, do you remember me
telling you this long ago in front of the Uchiha Stone Tablet? That the inscription
on the stone says, when two opposite sides cooperate,
you have true happiness. But I also told you it could
be interpreted differently. That's... The one who obtains
both Uchiha and Senju powers can attain true happiness. Don't you think it could be read
that way as well? Hashirama? It seems you've been doing
a lot of plotting since you left the village. No... Actually, this is something my subordinate's comrade came up
with by coincidence. Seems there was a fellow
who thought a lot like me. However... Me coming back to life
was exactly as planned! Damn it... I can't move! Though things did happen
out of order. Oh well. So this is Sage Art Chakra... Is that all there is to it? Seems like this will
be easy to control. This is the perfect chance now
that you're flesh and blood. This time I'll kill you for good, and send you back
to the afterlife! Regret that you're still not
a reanimation… as you go to your death! I can feel it... Your Mangekyo are Choku Tomoe,
a straight pattern. No wonder you have fine moves. It might be a good idea
to take your eyes until I get my Rinnegan back. Obito... Your usefulness is over. What did you do? Madara… has come back to life! You performed the Rinne Rebirth,
so you will die. This is the last step. I'm taking back that left eye. He'll last a little while longer
while I'm attached to him. Just what are you? You're not human. I am Madara's will incarnate. I will eliminate anyone
who gets in Madara's way. Black Zetsu. I thought you'd been captured... All of you, including Obito, greatly
underestimated Madara's plan. You underestimated me as well. I-I can't move now... I can't believe he's able
to transform his blade so much in such an instant! Then that's perfect. You'll go to Obito and bide your time until
I give you the order. I'm going to play a little here,
then head over. I just want to gauge
the present Kage's strength. I got it. He's a useless traitor
who went against Madara's plan. Until Obito dies,
I'll use his body to fight you. I've got to get some use
out of him, at least at the end. But killing you would be such
a waste with an eye like that. How about it? You're a survivor of
the Uchiha like me. Want to join forces? Make no mistake.
You're a dead man. Fine then... In any case,
you don't have much time left. Fire Style... Hiding in Ash Jutsu! Madara is regaining his past strength. Not good. His next target is... I'll be taking you all next... you filthy beasts! The taste of this blood,
this pain...

 This is my body!

 I can finally experience
and feel this fight.

 He's bleeding and wounded.

 In other words, he's not
a reanimation anymore.

 How did he come back to life?

 No way...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Hidden Heart"

 No way...with Obito?

 THE HIDDEN HEART

 Tune in again!

 Though things did
happen out of order. Oh well. So this is Sage Art Chakra… Is that all there is to it? Seems like this will be
easy to control. I'll be taking you all next… you filthy beasts. The Hidden Heart


 You know, staying here… Yeah…isn't wise. Get away from here! Shukaku! Get ready! Let's go wild! Wind Style… Sand Bomb! Salvo! Nice jutsu. But it lacks in finishing power… So you implant your sand with
this jutsu to stifle movement… Now, Shukaku! Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal! It's a Mausoleum Seal that uses my sand
and curse mark pattern! He sealed him! Did it work?! He'll never take another
breath of fresh air again! The Susano'o, huh! I'll be putting collars
on all of you shortly. Not one of you will
be able to get away. I won't let you! No one here's going to wag
his tail for you! Sorry we're late! We were moving the injured. Don't worry! There won't be any more wounded. We're ending this now! Stack tails! – Right!
– Right! You were close,
you damned raccoon! Quit ordering us around,
you dumb fox! But this should… Persistent bastard! But he's already taken a beating. All right! One more blast! Yeah, let's go, Naruto! Sorry I'm late, Lord Madara. You're finally here. Hey, that's Zetsu or
whatever he's called. Reinforcements? Just one? What's he doin' here now ♪ Isn't it kinda late? ♪ Do you have it? Of course. This should make things
a little more fun… This taste of blood…this pain! This is my body! Finally… I can fully
savor battle again! What's wrong, Kurama? His blood… It's bringing back some
really bad memories. Blood? That repulsive blood that
summoned me long ago. Hey, you dumb fox! Don't get scared
and stick your tail between your legs! I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you… This isn't like you! It's rubbing me the wrong way! Summoning Jutsu! Obito! He's gonna fight us using that? Kakashi, can you manage? Yes, in one way or another… Kamui! Did it work? I think… it failed… Not that thing again! Seems the right arm's been wrenched off. Seems there's someone left with
good eyes on the other side. Well, it's not much of an impediment. And now, I've got a pen for them. All I need to do is
shove them in there. A fake Rinnegan from a reanimation
can summon that thing? He's bleeding and wounded. In other words, he's not
a reanimation anymore. He possesses a real Rinnegan. How did he come back to life?! Naruto, I'm grateful to you. You even extracted
the Tailed Beasts from Obito, saving me the trouble
of weakening him. Don't tell me with
Obito's Rinne Rebirth… Now just come over, you bastard! Everyone's power… Don't you dare underestimate it! Then Obito's…! Obito… He's fighting to prevent
his Rinnegan from falling into
Madara's hands. You're stubborn,
for someone near death. This left eye came to you
through Nagato, but it's time for it to return it
to its rightful owner. The only ones who have awakened
the Rinnegan in this world are the Sage of Six Paths
and Madara Uchiha. It's not a mere thing to
be hoarded by the likes of you. I've hidden the right eye… And I'm going to have Kakashi
destroy the left eye right now. White Zetsu found
the right eye a while ago and turned it over to Lord Madara. You're a useless fool
who refuses to die… So stop resisting. You'd be dead already
if I wasn't sticking to you. Then detach from me and
take the Rinnegan after I die. The instant I detach from you,
these two will kill me. Before I can take the Rinnegan. Have you forgotten that
I was the one who gathered intel for Akatsuki? I've already analyzed these two
and their strength. It's going to take a bit longer
for the left eye. Seems like it. This also looks like it's going
to take a bit longer too. Don't compare me to that brat who took years to get back
those pets. You're covered in blood. Knowing that I possess
Hashirama's healing powers might cause me to fight crudely. Let's go! Wait. We don't know how
he's planning to attack. The Gedo Statue, huh… I'll proceed more carefully. If I use the Rinnegan's true powers, we should see
a more sophisticated battle. It will only be a few seconds. So watch closely! Limbo… Hengoku! He might try something… So be careful… What is this?
What just happened?! Damn you… The Tailed Beasts got knocked down! Was it Madara's jutsu?! That ought to have tamed you a bit. Now I can put on your collars! Something's coming! Eight-o! Kurama! First, I'll rip the Eight and
Nine Tails from their Jinchuriki! Eight-o! Damn it! That's right… If I just undo
this Kurama Mode…! It's useless. Once I catch them,
I won't let them go. It's not working! Kurama's not going
back inside me…! Damn it, I'm being pulled backwards! Lord Madara, you must take them
in order starting with the One Tail. I know that. Since you need to rip out
the last two Tailed Beasts, Eight and Nine Tails,
from the Jinchuriki, why not pull in the others, the one tail through seven
in the time being? You bastard! I'm not letting you
take Kurama! You're right, it looks like this will
take longer than I expected. So let's start…with this one! Desert Hands! You can't have Shukaku! When you fall asleep,
I'll take over your body and soul… And slaughter all you humans! Better not doze off. You hate humans? Yeah! I despise them! But… You're here to protect
my village, aren't you? I've never protected you all
because I wanted to. You humans are less than us beasts! Here's your meal, Shukaku! Why do we have to stand guard
over a creepy, weird monk even though we're senior shinobi? I know what you mean. But guarding the Jinchuriki means
they recognize your skills. Just stop whining and deal with it. Poor damned monk. They don't even call you by
your real name anymore. I don't really mind. Since you know my real name. You may be a monk,
but don't you ever get lonely… putting up with humans
who hate you, and a beast like me? Caged together with
a man-hating beast that's been with you ever
since you were born? Well, I'd die the moment
I'm separated from you… Since I'm a Jinchuriki. There's no need to distinguish
between human and beast. That's because a friend of
the heart provides peace of mind, no matter the species. You are one strange bastard. There isn't ever going to be
another human like you again. No… I think you're wrong. Human souls are like reflecting water. People often speak or act opposite
of their true feelings. But essentially,
the human heart wishes to connect with and
accept each other. Even with beasts. You know… you really do remind me of
the old man, Sage of Six Paths. Thank you. Those are the most heartwarming words
I've ever received from you. Hurry up and eat, old man!
We've got things to do here! I really can't see there being
others like you out there. I'm sure there are. And I know one day, there will be someone who will protect,
redeem, and shepherd you. And the moment you come
to accept his true heart, you too will likely comprehend… ACCEPTANCE HEART

The meaning of these words
my mentor etched onto my palms… LOVE Gaara, don't lose! Until now, I've always
considered you unpleasant. But it was because
I was a Jinchuriki, that I was able to meet Naruto… So there's one thing
I'm grateful to you for now. You Sand brat! Are you really that happy
to have your old pet back? How dare you interfere, even when you're not going
to die as a Jinchuriki! My motto is absolute defense! I've still got my pride as Shukaku! I know… No… you know nothing at all. People desire peace.

 And yet on the other hand,
crave conflict as well.

 That's right, Hashirama's nation-building
bore a paradox.

 People will sacrifice something in order
to protect something else.

 Stop Madara! Don't you—!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A True Ending"


 I gave you plenty enough time
How unfortunate.


 Tune in again!


 Gaara… Don't overexert yourself! I'm no longer a Jinchuriki… So... I can finally pull all-nighters
with you as an equal! Gaara… You… There's no need to distinguish
between human and beast. …remind me of Bunpuku. Damn it! Hey, Kazekage brat! Do me a favor! All right… You got that… Gaara?! Naruto! A True Ending


 Shukaku! Sorry… Bee! I'm counting on you…
Kazekage brat! I don't believe it… They've all been sucked in! Well, I guess... that's about all I can expect
from my current strength. It took more than a few seconds... But you were faster than Obito. You really do talk too much. You're all dud inventions of mine... Always finding fault with me. Black Zetsu is nicknamed
"Wicked Tongue" and they call us White Zetsu,
"Wagging Tongues." I hope the other battle
is going well. Don't worry!
After all, the base is good. Flying Raijin Slice! You're mine! This is my chance! Naruto… Gaara... Gaara! Naruto… I swear I will not let you die! Like I'd let you die! It's your M.O. to strike an opponent
when he's convinced of victory... Making the brats do the work... You're still a delegator,
aren't you, Tobirama? Same goes for you. However, heaven is on my side. Look at you, the one touted
as the fastest shinobi ever. There's a reason why
you two brothers can't regain your former speed. Whether it's coincidence
or if it's inevitable... I've got the edge now. Plus I'm nurturing a new eye. Though it's unclear which side
they'll end up on... Wait! Uchiha lad… Let me give you a jutsu. A jutsu? Yes… Madara stole my Sage Chakra… This jutsu will respond to
the Sage Chakra and bind him. Then do it yourself… If you're a reanimation,
you'll recover right away. If you want… I'll pull those things
out of your back for you. These rods seem to be piercing
my Chakra Points, preventing me from
infusing more chakra. Also, I think it's a bad idea
for you to touch them. I will give you all of
my remaining chakra. You must stop Madara… Why ask me, an Uchiha? You're a lot like him... Madara's younger brother… Izuna Uchiha. So? What does that have to do
with stopping him? Madara's fundamentally
a kind man. He was very devout
and loved his siblings. That's why he gave you
a chance at redemption. But killing you would be such
a waste with an eye like that. How about it? You're a survivor
of the Uchiha like me. Want to join forces? Make no mistake.
You're a dead man. Fine then… In any case, you don't have
much time left yourself. You might be able to stop Madara
without using force. Now…come stand before me. To be honest... I've wanted to do this
to you for a long time. Since you're… the one who killed Izuna! But you're just a moving corpse,
so it's hardly fulfilling. Madara… What is it that you
so desire so badly that you'd come back to life for? Our era, our time ended…
ages ago! I just want to build the nation
that Hashirama couldn't. But this world belongs to Hashirama,
my predecessor who failed. Drastic measures are needed
to save the dying patient. I'm going on ahead! So this thing called
the Infinite Tsukuyomi was your idea? This is your idea of a cure? Yes. Hashirama's nation-building
bore a paradox. People desire peace... And yet, on the other hand,
crave conflict as well. That duality is mankind. To only want peace
and to discard conflict... would cause people
to stop being people. And those two things stand
together side by side. Be they a friend...sibling...
or even my own child... I will not forgive anyone
who threatens the village. People will sacrifice something in order
to protect something else. Except in a true dream world. You've got a point. But…it's not a dream that you should interfere with! Now. You could say that this world is Hashirama's paradox world. Damn it! What is this?! In order to protect something… one must sacrifice something else. Stop, Madara! Don't go any further… "Be they a friend...sibling..." "or even my own child…" I gave you plenty of time. And I warned you…
that there wasn't much time left. How unfortunate. Madara! What kind of a man are you?! It's coming again! My jutsu won't activate! My chakra is—! I can't believe we've been stopped
by the likes of him... This strange thing...
It's blocking our way! It's using the Wood Style… What is it? I told you, I wouldn't let you
pass so easily. By the way, isn't there anyone
who can give me a serious answer to my question? I asked you, what does
it feel like to poo? Well… I'm thinking it's like
the refreshing feeling you get after killing someone. All five elements at once?! How do we counter that? I know! Impressive… Using the same jutsu simultaneously
as a counterbalance… We're saved. Don't underestimate Lord Third! That said, everyone's exhausted
most of their chakra. Which leaves only a reanimated
Lord Third to fight back. If Lord Third should fall,
we're done for... Forget Madara. We need to do
something about him. To be honest... Everyone needs to
start fighting as if Lady Tsunade, Shizune and I aren't able
to use Medical Ninjutsu anymore. This large-scale battle using
big attacks is taking too long! And we haven't had
a chance to regroup. We'll just have trust young Naruto
to take care of Madara. This is our chance, Lord Orochimaru! Not yet. This foe… No way! Shh! Be quiet! No way! This is—! What is it? S-Sa… Did something happen to Sasuke? It seems I should do it
sooner than later, after all... What is it, Ino? Naruto! What? What is that?!
That's Lord Gaara's…! Over there! Naruto! There's no time to explain. Hokage! Come with me! Heal Naruto as much you can
while we're en route. I've depleted my chakra.
I can't use Medical Ninjutsu anymore. Take Sakura.
She can still help a little. How did Naruto
end up like this?! What happened over there?! Just come! Don't waste time! I'll explain later! Quickly, Sakura, get on the sand! Right! How could this happen?! Is Naruto there? Yeah! Over there! Can't you use your Byakugan? Did he bring down Madara? Naruto's heartbeat…
is getting weaker and weaker! Naruto! Neji, please protect Naruto! Naruto Uzumaki… We're talking about
the Uzumaki Clan, so I'm sure he's going
to be stubborn… But trying to do anything
for him is useless. A Jinchuriki dies when
the Tailed Beast is extracted. – That's an absolute rule!
– That's an absolute rule! The fact that you possess
such eyes proves that you've continued to seek
something despite many great losses. But it all ends here. You will lose your very self. It's what they call a true ending. I always lied to you and
asked you to forgive me. Deliberately keeping you at
a distance by my own hand. All because I didn't want you to
get caught up in any of this. But now, I believe… That perhaps you could have
changed Father, Mother, and the rest of the Uchiha. I will love you always. I'm not dying. I…can't…die. I can't let Itachi's life...be in vain! No matter what darkness or
contradictions lie within the village... I am still Itachi Uchiha
of the Leaf! Not yet…not here… Until I build a true village… and become a true Kage. I'm... not gonna die! Hang in there! Don't give up! You are strong! You will make it! My chakra's almost all...! S-Sasuke is—! What's wrong, Karin? Sasuke is really going to—! At this rate... At this rate, Naruto's going to… – …die!
– ...die! To think Naruto would
end up like this!

 Sakura, I leave Naruto
in your hands!

 Naruto, you have always been
our village's symbol of hope.

 You were in everyone's thoughts
as they trained!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The New Chunin Exams"

 Yes, ever since that time...


 THE NEW CHUNIN EXAMS


 Tune in again!


 Sakura… I leave Naruto
in your hands! He has always been
our village's symbol of hope. Ever since that time,
everyone has always… What did Lord Jiraiya say? It seems the training
is going well. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Giant Rasengan! The force of your Rasengan has grown in
just two years of training. Perhaps it's about time
we move on to the next level. Next level? Yes… What're you gonna do? Perhaps the time has come
to utilize your inner power. Is that...? Yes… You may have to put your life
on the line for this training. All right, I'm ready for it! It's been two years already… The day that brat returns
may soon be upon us. LEAF HOSPITAL
 Naruto is a mysterious being… He's been away from the village
for two whole years and yet… Inuzuka Style!
Man Beast Transformation Combo! Two-Headed Wolf! Wolf Fang Over Fang! …his presence keeps on growing. Are you all right? I'm at my limit! Just ten more laps! If you stop now,
Naruto will laugh at you! Everyone seems to keep Naruto
in their thoughts as they train! A messenger hawk! Where?! Lord Kazekage! A Shinobi Hawk has
brought a message from the Hidden Leaf's
Fifth Hokage. The New Chunin Exams


 I was getting tired of waiting. You're our welcoming party? Thank you for coming to meet us. Well, it's a drag,
but seeing as it's Lord Kazekage… Welcome. Here is the data from
the Chunin Exams two years ago. A total of 153 entrants. Information about
the entrant's village, the three rounds of exams,
and the qualifying statistics have been compiled
for easy reading. But you would know more
about the reason behind the interruption of the final round
and its chronology. Due to the suspension
of the last Chunin Exams, the Hidden Leaf would like to
sponsor a combined Chunin Exam. Thanks in part to
the Hidden Leaf's cooperation, the situation in
our village has stabilized during the last two years… In particular, our training curriculum
has been very successful and we have developed more genin who are qualified to
take the Chunin Exams. Then you have no objection
to our sponsoring an event? Before that, Lady Hokage…
What's your true motive? "True motive?" I mean the timing of this thing.
Why hold the Chunin Exams now? If the reason is lack of personnel… you could have done this sooner. All right. I'll be honest. The first reason is to gauge
the reactions of each of the villages
within the Five Great Nations. Each, who on the surface,
purport to be at peace. Their response to having
the combined Chunin Exams will reveal their true feelings. The second reason is to
investigate Akatsuki's movements. It's said that they seek
the Tailed Beasts from each village, but they've been awfully quiet
these past two years. You want to use the Chunin Exams
to open the village to create an opportunity
to lure the Akatsuki out? Yes. The Akatsuki have
probably grown impatient and are ready to make a move. This is a risky— Hold on. These Chunin Exams… The Hidden Sand
would like to host it, in conjunction with
my introduction as Kazekage. That will not do. The Hidden Leaf must
sponsor these Chunin Exams. It's so that we may finish
what we started previously. Yes, absolutely. Lord Kazekage cannot
decide this all by himself. He must consult the village elders. Yeah. We need time to contact them. Let's come back to this again
at the next meeting. Fine. We'll settle this during
the next meeting. This is becoming a drag. Yeah. I didn't expect Gaara
to make such an announcement. He really didn't tell you anything? That came out of nowhere. Well, he probably
has his own ideas. I leave it to you. If the Hokage is right
and the Akatsuki make their move, you're going to be
their target, right? If the enemy wants
the Tailed Beasts, they'll come for me
sooner or later. Then I'll just be the bait
and take them down. What are you saying?! The village has welcomed you
as their new Kazekage but things are still unstable! I'm aware of that. I know that some are not happy
that I have become the Kazekage… and would welcome
an opportunity to kill me. Then why would you even consider
hosting the event in our village?! It is precisely why I want the Chunin Exams
in Hidden Sand Village. You can't be serious! It's not the Akatsuki
you want to lure out… But the rebels in the village? That's just too dangerous. Regarding the combined
Chunin Exams under discussion… It is Lord Kazekage's desire to host the event
in Hidden Sand Village. He intends to introduce himself
to the other nations. Is that wise? While things have been quiet
for a while now, it does not change
the fact that Gaara is "a military weapon to be feared." As long as Gaara lives, this village can never
be truly at peace. For the second round of the exam,
Lord Gaara intends to suggest the Demon Desert
as a suitable arena. And we, the Hidden Sand,
will do our utmost to support him! Yura is on to us. No…everyone is
uneasy about Gaara. But that's not enough
to plan a coup d'état. Well, well…my elders… Of all places to find you. What do you want? We said we are in favor
of Lord Gaara's plan. Nothing, I just forgot to tell you… Lord Gaara plans to
personally supervise the exam site. We'll have to be very careful
with preparations. After all, the second round
is a survival test and there are always fatalities. Why who's to say
nothing will happen to the supervisor himself,
Lord Gaara… Excuse me… So this is the perfect opportunity
to get rid of the Kazekage and make it look purely accidental… But he is a Jinchuriki. There's a way. The first Jinchuriki, Bunpuku, was able to temporarily seal
Shukaku into a teapot. We can use that… What is your decision,
Lady Tsunade? Two years ago, Jiraiya had intel
that said the Akatsuki would target Naruto
in three or four years. And two years have passed… I'm sure they're itching
to make a move. You're not going to use Naruto
as bait are you? No… As the Hokage of
Hidden Leaf Village, I cannot do such a thing. Don't tell me…Lord Kazekage
will assume that role? As luck would have it,
he was the one who proposed it. But will the advisors agree? I'll placate them
by suggesting a joint-sponsorship. We can't negotiate any further. I looked over the plans
you submitted… What do you think about a joint-sponsorship
with the Hidden Leaf? We'll hold round one,
the written exam, at the Hidden Leaf… And the Hidden Sand will host the site of
the second round survival test. The Forest of Death has
become too familiar as a test site. I was just thinking a new site
would be necessary. Hmm… I agree. We have no objections. All right then… We'll meet again
at the Chunin Exams. Yeah… Come to us if any trouble arises. We'll take care of it, Mr. Crybaby. Damn it. She doesn't change. The Hidden Sound probably
won't take part this time around… So should we just send invitations to everyone else
from the last time? Yes. In addition,
send invitations for the introduction of
the new Kazekage to every village within
the Five Great Nations. I see… Then we can monitor
each village's response. Aside from Akatsuki,
this is the other reason for reopening
the combined Chunin Exams. Yes, I understand. Deliver this to every village. It's the invitation to
the Chunin Exams. – Right!
– Right! We've put out the bait… Now, let's see how they react. Lady Tsunade. The Hidden Sand replied right away… Oh… They'll be sending nine teams…
27 genin. Last time,
they sent 30 in ten teams… Although that's one team short, considering the Hidden Sand's
current situation, one has to commend them
for nurturing this many genin. Yes… Any word from the other villages? No, not yet. How will the other Kage respond? Chunin Exams, you say?! Damn that Princess Tsunade! She's getting carried away! She probably coaxed
the Kazekage into cooperating… …and plans to get the jump on us
within the Five Great Nations. What will you do? Ignore her! Just ignore her! Do not mention of word of this,
or the past, to anyone! Especially Bee!
Do not let him find out! Whenever there
are events like this, he gets excited about live concerts
and what not. Actually, I already told him. What?! He kept asking questions…
I'm sorry. Bee! Where is Bee?! Don't tell me… Find Bee immediately
and bring him here! Understood. This is so dull… A concert at Hidden Leaf Village… Tuning up at the Chunin Exams… Take a lesson from Kin-chan Sensei! Yay! Bee! Lord Raikage wants to see you! Please return! Fool, ya fool! What did Lord Raikage say? Unfortunately, they are swamped
with village business and don't have enough
time to prepare. Now why would the Hokage
and Kazekage send a letter? Seems they're resuming
the Chunin Exams… What shall we do? We must consider the matter
with Lord Yagura the Fourth… I believe we should concentrate
on rebuilding the village… You may have a point. Yes! We can't be wasting
our time participating in a ceremony announcing
the new Kazekage… CEREMONY

Ceremony… CAN'T WASTE TIME FOR
A CEREMONY FOR ME

Can't waste time for
a ceremony for me? Shut up or I'll kill you. What?! Perhaps we should forego
the Chunin Exams this time. Let's do that. It seems the Hidden Mist
are tied up as well. The Hidden Leaf has
delivered an invitation to the combined Chunin Exams! Their ulterior motive
is crystal clear! They want to test
the strength of the villages and prepare for the next battle! Just throw it back in their face! I intend to do so! This is what I'll do
to their invitation! WIND NATION FIRE NATION
 I want you to go here. To Hidden Rain Village. Yes, the most troublesome spot. As expected, every person
who enters is investigated, and they're kept under strict
surveillance during their stay. Hanzo of the Salamander rules it… Yes, so I've heard. Even if I'm carrying an invitation
to the combined Chunin Exams, I doubt if they'll
let me in easily. There's domestic instability
and even rumors of a coup d'état. It's so closed off, no one knows
the true state of things. While I'm at it, shall I look into
their internal affairs then? Yes, but don't take any chances. Are you actually
going to supervise?

 Yes. I'm going to participate
among frontlines

 of the Second Round by supervising.

 What will you achieve
by smoking out the rebels?

 No…

 Then why? Why would you go
so far as to face danger head on?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
The Chunin Exams Begin!


 Naruto is working hard
to forge bonds with others…


 THE CHUNIN EXAMS BEGIN!


 Tune in again!


 Halt! Are you a shinobi
of the Hidden Leaf? Yes, I'm Kakashi Hatake
of Hidden Leaf Village. Our Lady Hokage sent me here. I have a joint letter from the Hidden Leaf
and the Hidden Sand. Then I will accept it. No… I've been ordered to
present it to your leader, Hanzo of the Salamander himself. Is that a part of your plan
to get close to Lord Hanzo?! Threatening me is the same as
threatening the Hidden Leaf and Sand… Is that what you really want? All right… I'll let them know. The Chunin Exams Begin!


 Lord Hanzo will see you now. Surrender all of your weapons,
and then enter. As rumored, the immigration inspections
are extremely strict. So his security is airtight. Kakashi Hatake… Nice of you to come. Put the message you brought
over there. The Leaf has brought an invitation
to the Chunin Exams jointly sponsored by them
and the Sand. It's probably just a ploy to gather
all the villages and spy on them. Hanzo sent many of the genin from
this village for the last Chunin Exams. Then send a few teams
to keep them happy. Let them keep believing that
Hanzo is the leader of the Hidden Rain… In the meantime, we'll gather intel
about the Jinchuriki. Understood… Is everyone here? A letter has arrived from Hanzo of
the Salamander from the Hidden Rain Village. Well, well… He's sending genin to
join the Hidden Leaf and Sand… Does this repudiate the rumors
surrounding the Hidden Rain then? No… Sending genin could simply be
a ruse to hide the truth… Then… Keep a close watch on the Hidden Rain genin
who are sent here. I am so bored… Fuu! Lord Shibuki wants to see you. Oh no! Did I do something? WATERFALL Lord Shibuki, I've brought Fuu. Hey, Fuu! What's up, Chief?! What were you thinking?! Requesting an application for
the Chunin Exams from the Hidden Leaf?! Shouldn't I have? Then can you recommend me? What?! And what will you do if it leaks out
that you're a Jinchuriki? Well then…
I guess I'll go on my own. Huh?! H-Hey wait! Wait, Fuu! I want to see the outside world! If you won't acknowledge me,
I'll just leave the village! A-All right! You never give up once
you make up your mind. Will you forgive me? Then listen to me. The Chunin Exams aren't
your run-of-the mill tests. It's a battle where you
put your life on the line for your dreams and
the pride of the village. In the past, the Village Hidden
in the Waterfalls was nowhere near the scale
of the Hidden Leaf or Sand, but we were feared as a shinobi village that produced
skilled jonin, one after another. That's why although we are
not part of the Five Great Nations, we are allotted a Tailed Beast. The Chunin Exam is the ideal opportunity
to make a name for us and impress the Feudal Lords
who hire Hidden Villages, and other shinobi leaders as well. It's our chance to restore
our past glory. As long as you're going
to participate, go out and fight to make
the Hidden Waterfall known. All right! Got it! I'll rile up a storm! However! Don't let anyone find out… …that you are a Jinchuriki… Okay! Kegon, Yoro… Hide your jonin status
and guard Fuu. Right! – Right!
– Right! He's beyond my control now. Does this mean… the Hidden Waterfalls will
send one team of three? It's almost terrifying
in its brevity, but it is an official application. Let's close
the application period soon! Oh! What is it? W-We forgot to solicit
Hidden Leaf entrants! What?! Are you actually going
to supervise? Yes. I'll oversee the finals
of the second round. It's so that no fatalities
occur during the test. What will you achieve
by smoking out the rebels? It's not like that… Then what? Why would you go so far
as to face danger head on? My feelings haven't changed
from that time. Don't tell me…
you want to bond with the rebels? That's impossible! Even if you're up to it,
they won't listen! He is… Naruto is working hard,
to forge bonds with others… So I won't give up either
until the day comes when I can share suffering,
sadness, and happiness with others. I consider this my first test, as the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand. Once he makes up his mind,
he won't listen… Damn it! The Hidden Sand will send
the same as last time… Nine teams, 27 shinobi. The Hidden Rain will have fifteen. And Hidden Grass is sending six. The Hidden Waterfall sent word that they are also sending
a team of three. The Hidden Cloud and
Land of Water sent polite regrets, but our invitation was sent back
by the Land of Earth. As the host village, we'll have to enter the same number
as the last exams. I want all of you to list
the genin under you and turn in your recommendations. Are you stupid? That's barely cooked. Meat tastes best when
there's still some red left. Hey, Asuma Sensei… So what's going to happen
to our team in the upcoming Chunin Exams? Considering your skills now,
it's only natural I recommend you. But Shikamaru is already
a chunin, so he can't enter. So we're one member short. Currently, Team Asuma is
captained by Shikamaru. If I'm to find a replacement… It's going to be difficult to be a stand-in for only
the Chunin Exams. Umm… I have someone in mind. Someone who rivals Shikamaru
in intelligence? CIPHER CORPS Is there anyone like that? She's probably not
as smart as Shikamaru, but she may just
be tougher than him. You'll be fine now. Me? Join Team Asuma? Both Sasuke and Naruto
are missing from Team 7, right? Y-Yeah… So you need to
join a three-man team in order to take
the Chunin Exams, right?! Yeah… So you'll join, right? But… I know your strength
better than anyone. At the last Chunin Exams… I got a good taste of your power. Still…I can't.
Please find someone else. Why?! We know that you've trained hard
under Lady Tsunade for two years. You've grown so much. If you're just going to wait
for Naruto and Sasuke… If you do that, you'll never be able to grab
opportunities that come around! It's not that… If you add me onto your team now,
I'll probably be a nuisance. That's not true! Please! Cha! Your movements are getting better! By the way, do you remember
the first thing I taught you? Of course. Medic Ninja must never
get themselves killed. Thus they must never force
their way forward. That is true… However, that does not mean
that you don't have to learn jutsu necessary
to fight on the frontline. And… What I'm teaching you now… Keep it buried in your heart
and train. Understood? Yes! While I'm training,
I'll only be a burden to others. But… How did it go?
What did Sakura say? She turned us down. Aww… We're short one,
and she's short two. I thought it would
have been perfect! What did Sakura say? She doesn't want to
be a burden on us. What a lame excuse. But… I haven't given up yet! Excuse me. Oh…sorry. Please… Thank you! Excuse me. May I ask you to take a look
at these and put your seal on it? Shizune, do you want to kill me?! It's been a while since
we had the Chunin Exams and nothing moves forward
without your seal of approval. Damn it…
I didn't expect all this work. Oh, Sakura was here. What? If she needed something,
why didn't she just come in? What would Naruto do…
if he were in my place? I'm going to attack you now… and it'll be for real. Come at me seriously,
as if I'm your enemy. Got it! LEAF HOSPITAL What's wrong? Sakura! He got caught under
a landslide during a mission. His condition is grave. He needs emergency surgery
right away. Take him to the ICU immediately! Right! ICU I'm beginning treatment. I can't keep running behind
Naruto and Sasuke forever. I have to surpass my limits
on my own. It's no good.
I don't have enough chakra! I need to concentrate
more chakra for the surgery… More…more chakra! What? Sakura is?! Yes. We just got word
from Leaf Hospital… This is not good. What? But Sakura is skilled enough
to do a surgery like this… If this was our usual Sakura… We have to go. ICU Sakura! The Jutsu Ritual using chakra
was completed without incident. The surgery was a success. Leave it to your student.
She did an outstanding job. I see. You are truly a disciple of Tsunade,
one of the Legendary Sannin. At this point,
you should be capable of overcoming any hardship
that comes your way. Okay, with the team of
Ino, Choji and Sakura… our participant list is complete. It's not as many as the 29 teams
we had the last time… But it's a decent list of participants. Yes. The time has finally come. The Chunin Exam!

 It's been a while
since they last held them!

 It's been two years.

 I see, so this means
Big Brother Naruto's coming back!

 Huh? Naruto?

 He's coming back to
take the Chunin Exam, right?

 He's not coming.

 What?

 Who knows where or how
he's training right now.

 His whereabouts are still unknown…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 ​In Naruto's Fuutsteps ~ The Path Traveled
"The Three Questions"



 Does this mean they're going to proceed
without including Big Brother Naruto?



 ​In Naruto's Fuutsteps ~ The Path Traveled
THE THREE QUESTIONS



 Tune in again!


 The Three Questions


 Big Brother Shikamaru,
what's going on? Hmm? The first round of the Chunin Exams
will be held here, so we're just making
a few upgrades. The Chunin Exams! It's been a while
since they last held them! It's been two years… That means we get to participate! We can be chunin! You guys are
still Academy students. You're not even genin,
you can't participate. That's kind of a disappointment,
but also a big relief… I see, so this means
Big Brother Naruto's coming back! Huh? Naruto? He's coming back to take
the Chunin Exams, right? He's not coming. What? Who knows where or how
he's training right now. His whereabouts are still unknown. I don't know if he even
got the news that we're holding
the Chunin Exams. Does this mean
they're going to proceed without Big Brother Naruto? It's not like the village can plan
things to fit his schedule. Big Bro's going to be left behind. Our leader's going to
get disqualified! We're representing the Hidden Sand,
so we have to become chunin, okay? It's too soon to get
all worked up. Calm down, Yukata. Seems like Shikamaru
will be a proctor. That's not surprising. It's because he's already a chunin. Then let's buckle down and
get promoted to chunin too! Right? Looking forward to
doing this with you! - Let's kick some butt.
- Yeah! All right, so the three of you
are taking the exams, correct? You've been signed up. There's no trick this time, like preventing us from submitting
an application is there? The exam is up to
the proctor in charge. Okay, pull lots. Three? Two? One? Return the lots and please proceed
to the classroom that you picked. They're so polite,
it's almost creepy. Did Shikamaru plan this? What is he thinking? Next, please. You're the entrants from
Hidden Waterfall Village. The name's Fuu. All right, please pull a lot. We've waited so long for this, so we have to make it
and become chunin! You're so loud! Is this where the Chunin Exams
are being held?! Hey! I'm back. Naruto! No way…
Is that you, Naruto?! Are you real? I'm real! You really haven't changed much. Sure, I have! Want to see
the results of all my training? Sexy Jutsu! How's that? Here! There! He's as stupid as ever… And that's why Naruto is Naruto. Byakugan! All right, I'm going to take part
in the Exams too. But you need a team of three. I just came home and
there's no one left, so I'll just ask them to
make an exception. Huh?! What's the big idea? Don't get mad at Konohamaru! Are you all right, Konohamaru? It's all for Big Brother Naruto. Naruto? Because Big Brother
can't take the exams. It's because he won't be able
to be a chunin. So you tried to take it
for him instead… A stand-in test taker… You don't need to worry
about him. Naruto's is someone who'll
keep striving to become Hokage without getting hung up on
the details like becoming a chunin. He's right. And when he returns,
we'll welcome him with a big smile. I got it. Next in line. One. Three… Two… Okay, leave the lots and
go to your assigned rooms. Room One is
the classroom up ahead. Rooms Two and Three
are up the stairs. Huh? We're being separated? We're on our own? I'm in Room One. Oh! Big Brother Neji! Why were we separated
from our teams? I have no idea. Huh? It won't open. I wonder what's happening? Isn't the proctor coming? They're planning something… Heh, bring it on! There's a stack of papers here. You shouldn't go around
carelessly touching things… Uh…Ahem! I am Shikamaru Nara, the proctor for the first round
of the Chunin Exams. Participants, take one sheet from
the stack on the teacher's desk, then take any seat. Round One is a written test,
after all. Oh good, it's the same as usual. Is everyone seated? This is a drag,
so let's get right to it. This is a drag for him? We're serious about this! You guys are lucky.
I'm in charge this year. He might be right. Why? He won't do anything unreasonable. Round One is a written test. Read the questions carefully. Three questions… The three questions are worth,
from the top: 30 points, 40 points,
and 50 points. A perfect score is 120 points? Not 100? Each of you will answer
just one of three questions. Your team's total points
will determine pass-fail. If your team total exceeds 100,
the team is disqualified. That's crazy! Then, for example… If the three have…
30, 30, 50 for 110 points… 30, 40, 40 for 110 points… or 40, 40, 40 for 120 points… These totals will
disqualify them, right? Then we'll take the average
of the teams who remain… and teams who score below
the average will be disqualified. Those over the average will pass. An average score? Of the teams' totals…? Just a minute. How are we supposed to…?! The exam starts now. Which question should I solve? I don't understand
this question at all! The question isn't just about
solving the questions… Please don't say things that
will confuse me even more! The three questions aren't that hard. Unless you're really dumb, anyone can solve
the 50-point question too. Don't underestimate me! I won't run! I'll take the exam! I don't care if I get stuck as
a genin for the rest of my life, because I'll be Hokage someday,
no matter what! Come to think of it… there was a guy
who was really that dumb… He couldn't solve a single question
in the first-round exam, but he passed. Which means… They're not testing
our problem-solving skills. It's the same as the last time! Now then… 100 points is either…
30, 30 and 40… Or 50, 50 and 0. What's the whole point
of this first-round exam? The point of it is to think about how your other two
team members will score. Or rather, how to make your two
team members get a certain score. That gives an advantage to teams
who know jutsu to contact each other. If that's the case, that's fine. All it means is that those teams
that have those skills will get 100 points. And the rest have to suck it up
and figure something out, huh? The first-round test in
the last Chunin Exams was just like this, wasn't it? The point count isn't what's important. The Chunin Exams shine
the light on who is captain material. If the point was to test strength,
I wouldn't be a chunin. I guess so. What? No snide comeback? It's been sealed off. Big Brother Neji? Double paned windows, huh… They made sure that
we couldn't contact our teammates. Should you be moving around like that? We were told a few rules,
but no one's cautioned us yet NO UNAUTHORIZED FIGHTING


for talking like this. I see… So, they don't care if
we cheat or not. That's right… Last time, the first exam
was all about cheating. It won't open… Leave it to Shikamaru…
This is a difficult problem. If you can contact your teammates,
you gain an advantage for this exam… But nobody on my team
uses such ninjutsu. I wonder if Shino has any ideas… The only thing left is to try to guess
which question my teammate will solve. If we choose the number
we each picked… the point total will be over 100. Going over 100 points
means immediate disqualification. We have to avoid that at all cost. If one of us scores zero points,
we'll avoid going over 100, right? But there's no guarantee that the other two will each answer
the 50-point question. And if the point total is too low, there's a good possibility of
being dropped for a low average. If all of us solve the 30-point question
and get 90 points, we'll lose to the team
that has 100. If many teams score 100 points, and raise the average score,
teams with 90 points will be disqualified. I guess finding
a loophole seems impossible. The choices are 30, 30, 40
or 0, 50, 50 to score 100 points. So the question is… figuring out which question
each team member will solve. How should I know what
questions Ino and Sakura will pick? What would Shino and Kiba do? Those two are probably wondering
the same thing right now. Got it! I finally figured it out! Huh? You did? Yes! I solved the 50-point question! Oh…I see. I'm not going to show you. I won't look. I don't have to look. Who are you? You don't seem to be
an Insect User, but… I hate to say this,
but if Naruto were here, this first-round exam
would be easy. Huh? Why? I mean, he'd score zero for sure. I think even Naruto could
solve this 30-point question. Definitely not. Leave it to Naruto… It would be much simpler if Lee
on our team was as obviously dumb. Umm… Excuse me. Yes? Can you tell me just what
we're supposed to do for this first-round exam? That's what we're trying
to figure out! You too, huh? These questions are
really hard, aren't they? Well…yeah. Wouldn't you think
the safest thing to do is for each of us to choose
the 30-point question? Didn't he say something
about the average score too? I see… We have to score 100 points,
no matter what. I can't even figure out
how to get 100 points. And time keeps on ticking away… I've trained hard… I'll try it. First, I have to sense those two. Hey, you two, please listen… Is that you, Fuu? All right. What're you up to? My teammates… Sensory Jutsu! Four…? I see… I don't get it. Choji… Huh?! I'll solve the 40-point question,
so Choji, you do the 30-pointer. Oh, okay. Okay! I'll get Sakura to do the 30-pointer too. Hey, Gennai! Inaho! Can you hear me?! Tanzo, Minoji! It's me! – It's me!
– Hey! It's me! – What are you trying to do?
– Can you hear me? At this rate,
no one's voice will be heard. Do you hear something? Is someone yelling? That's right! If they can hear me
on the other side…! Hey! Can you hear me?! I can hear something. Someone's yelling. A lot of people are yelling. I see. Hey! Komugi, Gennai! Yahoo! Yahoo! Shouldn't we stop them?! If I stop them,
this exam would be meaningless. Now then,
who's doing to do what? I'll do the 50-point question! I'll do the 40-point one! It's so noisy. Who can hear over all this? There's shouting in
the other classes too. Everyone's voices are
blending together and nothing can
be communicated. Nothing can be communicated, huh? Just watch… Sand Letters! "I'll do the 40-point question." It's Sajin! He wants us to do the 30-pointer. With that we'll total 100 points. Those fools… Lady Hinata… Let's continue your lesson here. What are you saying,
Big Brother Neji? There's something I want to try. All right. Perform the Eight Trigrams:
Air Palm… with all your might. – Eight Trigrams: Air Palm!
– Eight Trigrams: Air Palm! W-What the—?! Hey… You guys… What the hell are you guys doing?! Showing you the answer
to the question. What's the answer
that you prepared?

 This question wouldn't exist
if I wasn't the proctor.

 That's why there is no point
in me answering that question.

 What are you quibbling about?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"One Worthy As A Leader"

 All right,
Let's see what Neji's going to do.


 In Naruto's Footsteps ~ The Path Traveled
ONE WORTHY AS A LEADER



 Tune in again!


 One Worthy as a Leader


 Any idiot can solve
a question like this. – Huh?
– Yeah, he's right. So what question
are you going to solve? Why should I tell you? Everyone is in a dilemma
because they don't know… which one to solve. It's because they don't know which ones their teammates
will choose. Neji is planning something. But why would he tell the others
what he plans to do? The method he plans
to use probably necessitates it. Do you know? I don't know about
my teammates either. What is that supposed to mean? But if there's a way to let them know
how many points I'll get, I can solve the question. That's if you can let them know. I'll communicate the number
to the next room with vibration. I'll send four vibrations
through the wall. I'll relay the information without
leaving the room or destroying it. But will just hitting the wall
get your message across? How would you interpret
four bangs on the wall? If I should hear four signals…? That wouldn't mean the other person
and I should score 40 points. If two takes 40 each,
that's 80 points. Then if the one
who signaled takes 50, 40, 30, 0 points… None of the combinations
totals 100. So it can be interpreted that the one
who signaled will take the 40-pointer. And the other two
can take the 30-pointers. – I see.
– That makes sense. I wonder if Gennai and Inaho
will think the same way. I hope Minoji and Tanzo
are okay. Each village selected three genin to make up their teams
for the Chunin Exams. Everyone just has
to trust their teammates. But why would you teach this
to all of us? If I suddenly pounded
on the wall four times, what would you think? Well… Naturally, I'd get suspicious. You would, right? And I didn't want you guys
to do something and interfere. I figured I'd come clean
and let everyone in on this, and we can all pass
this stupid paper test. All of us?! So that's his plan. Everybody passes…
He really got you there, Mr. Proctor. Well, I've gotten a good look
at his leadership skills. All of us? I see… You're right. But how about letting me pass on
the info to the other classes? Sure, but why? I can't let the Hidden Leaf
do all the work. I'll take the blame if
the classroom is damaged. I just have to send vibrations, right? Yes. One! Two! Three! Four! Hey, that was five! What're you doing? Everyone passes? You've got to be kidding. What's the sense of having a test
unless someone's eliminated?! W-Why you…! – What a jerk!
– What's going on? It's too late now. If you send four vibrations again, you'll only add
to the confusion. It doesn't matter
if it's five times. What? Three times is fine too. As long as I get
the message out, any one will do. Any one? Three, four, or five…
They're all the same? Yes. Well, it's slightly different. The question I pick will change. Huh? I see… That was a signal of some sort. It's definitely more efficient
than yelling something out. But why five times? Five times must mean
the 50-point question. So what are we supposed to do? I get it… To get 100 points using
a 50-point question, two members need
to solve the 50-pointer and the third member
needs a zero. Whoever signaled
won't solve the 50-pointer. That's what the message
is telling us exactly that. What does that mean? I'm saying the remaining two
would have to select the 50-point or 0-point question, with no way of knowing
which to choose. So he's signaling both teammates
to both solve the 50-point question. So whoever signaled
will get zero points? Exactly, hoping that each teammate
will think about the other and figure it out. So who sent the message? I don't know, but whoever sent it got everyone
in that classroom to agree. Otherwise, it would've been impossible. So, everyone in that classroom
that signaled will take zero points. It's because this message
is signaling the remaining two members
to choose the 50-point question. So that's what it means. Still, opting to get zero points
is pretty gutsy. Even with three times, my intention
would have been communicated. In that case,
I'd take the 40-pointer. How can you tell? If the grouping is 30, 30,
and 40 for 100 points, whoever sent the signal
won't take 30. Because that'll leave
the remaining two to decide between 30 and 40 points,
and that won't work. So whoever signals takes
the 40-pointer, leaving the 30-pointer
to his two teammates. Damn you.
Why didn't you explain that earlier? I made it clear, didn't I?
That I didn't want any interference. I was concerned that jutsu users who can communicate silently
with their teammates would foil my plan for everyone
to pass this round. You can, right? No one will get in my way. Well, you're not getting in my way! NO UNAUTHORIZED FIGHTING Proctor, are you going
to allow fighting?! If you don't reply,
I'll assume you are. You want to fight? Mr. Proctor, give us permission! I made it clear that Round One
is a written exam. Fighting is prohibited! Stop that racket and answer
the question before the time's up! You heard him. That Neji…
He even forced a hint out of me. In that warning you just issued? Until now, there was a possibility
that the others would think I was the one who
pounded five times. I warned them to keep quiet just now,
thus raising the possibility that it was someone in
a classroom who made those sounds. And in truth, it was. So every team will score 100 points? No, not necessarily. If they rationalize it calmly,
they'd agree with Neji… But just how calm can they remain? How much faith they have
in their teammates is another problem all together. What's the answer
that you prepared? You're asking me? If you were one of
the test takers over there. I'd use my Shadow Possession Jutsu… But this question wouldn't exist
if I weren't the proctor. That's why there is no point
in me answering that question. What are you quibbling about? Anyway, it all boils down
to thinking carefully about your teammates
and the situation. Still, there's bound to
be many who pass. And that'll make
the Second Round a pain. I won't make trouble
for the Hidden Sand. There's another part to this exam. Time's up. Everyone, flip your sheets over. Continuing to the second part
of the exam. – What?!
– Huh?! Question. Your team is on a mission
and the enemy spots you. In order to shake off
their pursuit, one teammate must stay behind
as a decoy. Who will you choose… knowing that the decoy
faces certain death? Write down your answer on
that reverse side of your sheet. In order to pass, all three members on the team
must have the same answer. And the member named as
the decoy will be considered killed and eliminated from the Exams. You have three minutes for this. Begin! How does he expect us to choose…? Sand Letters… So we'll go with Mijin? Me?! Damn it… MIJIN In our old Team 7,
it would have been Naruto. Because he would probably
write his own name down. Sakura! Sasuke! I'll be the decoy,
so you two make a run for it. So my answer is… NARUTO NARUTO           NARUTO NARUTO           NARUTO
ME You idiot! Shut up! And thanks a lot, you two,
for naming me the decoy?! NARUTO

What about you writing down "Me"? NARUTO
We figured you'd choose yourself,
so Sakura and I wrote "Naruto." ME              NARUTO
Like we were supposed
to know you'd write "Me"! You're mean, both of you! Shinobi who don't value
their comrades are scum! The answer isn't Naruto. My teammates now
are Ino and Choji… So… Sakura! What'll we do?
I can't choose either of you! What is Shikamaru thinking? Ino, please relay this to Choji too. The answer is… Huh?! But that's…! I'll be collecting your papers. Wait in your classrooms
until the papers are graded. Those who passed will be
called out to the schoolyard. You rarely visit.
To what do I owe this pleasure? There's something you need to know. You don't need Hidden Leaf proctors
for the Second Round? The Hidden Sand would like
to handle everything ourselves. And the reason for that? The site of the Second Round
is known as the Demon Desert. It's extremely dangerous even for
those of us familiar with the terrain. For the sake of security,
we ask for your understanding. For whose security, may I ask? Naturally, for the participants. The jonin in charge of the entrants will accompany them
to Hidden Sand Village. That is not open to negotiation. Yes, that's fine. What do you think? Sounds suspicious. Yes, they are hiding something. But the Sand are not the only ones. How have the Hidden Rain responded? Danzo asked to see us earlier. Even though he's confined
under house arrest, he still has his connections. You are aware that I helped
Hanzo of the Salamander, the leader of the Hidden Rain? That was when you were
in charge of the Foundation. I continued to communicate with him
secretly even after I was ousted. Danzo, you didn't…? But Hanzo abruptly
stopped contacting me. If he stopped trusting me, he would've lured me out
and killed me since I know so many secrets. But he didn't. Something has happened to Hanzo. Like what? I believe there's been
an incident in Hidden Rain Village. In the worst case,
he's no longer in this world… How can that be? On the outside, Hanzo is still
the leader of the Hidden Rain. Please warn Princess Tsunade to be extremely wary of the entrants
sent by the Hidden Rain. Well, you have been warned. Danzo of all people asked you this? He may be called a hardliner
and the darkness within shinobi… But there is no doubt that he operates all for
the sake of the Hidden Leaf. The Hidden Rain, eh… We must increase surveillance. There's also the Sand to think of. I will inform the jonin in charge
of the entrants about this. Just the jonin of the teams
who pass the first round? Yes. Damn it… Well… Those of you here have passed
the First Round. Congratulations. Neji, you sent that signal, right? Thanks to you, we made it. Truth be told,
that guy from the Sand did it. How come all three of you made it? Didn't the decoy get disqualified? The rule said all three had
to have the same answer. We didn't choose anyone. What?! We all turned in a blank sheet. Blank? All three of you?! There's no way we'd sacrifice
a comrade. Take a look… at how many teams passed
with all three members. I'm sorry I couldn't figure out
the question. It's okay! We coordinated things
with that in mind. I know! I trusted you two and
didn't write anything. More like couldn't, right? You guys! We passed Round One! You can transfer thoughts,
but that backfired on you, eh. Well… Thinking about letting a teammate die
was already the wrong answer. Why you… I'm Temari of the Sand. I'm in charge of Round Two
of the Exams. Too many teams passed
the first round, so we're going to narrow it down
some more. Hey, what do you mean
"narrow it down"?! First off, Round Two is also
a team battle. Any team without its third member
will be disqualified! What?! Furthermore, Round Two will be held
in the Village of the Hidden Sand. We will meet at
the Demon Desert checkpoint. Although there is a clear route between the Hidden Leaf
and Hidden Sand Villages, it will take a shinobi three days,
no matter how fast he or she may be. A messenger hawk has been sent to
the Hidden Sand with these instructions. "After the first 30 arrive,
all who follow are to be disqualified." Finally, as in Round One,
fighting is prohibited en route. You can fight to your heart's content
in Round Two. That is all. Lee, Tenten… He's quick to assess a situation,
after all. What's wrong?
You're dismissed! Ino, Choji! Oh, I get it! The elimination race has
already begun! Couldn't you at least
have said, "ready, set, go"? This is the Chunin Exams.
Not the Academy. Huh? – Hey, Yukata!
– Get moving! Maybe next time, we should stick
to an ordinary scholastic test. Let's get there first! There's no advantage
to being the first to arrive. Byakugan! There's one team ahead of us. Lord Kazekage… Round One of
the Chunin Exams is over. The participants are now heading
towards the Hidden Sand Village. I see. Get ready for Round Two. The people targeting you
are stepping up their efforts.

 If you casually go out there,
you'll be playing into their hands!

 I already know.

 But if I quit because of that,

 it would be like declaring that
I caved in under pressure.

 The Chunin Exams are the beginning
of everything for me.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Night Before the Second Exam"



 I'll show them by making sure
these Chunin Exams proceed successfully.


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SECOND EXAM



 Tune in again!


 The Night Before the Second Exam

 Where are you trying to go? The Kazekage's quarters
are beyond here. Hold it! Who the hell are you?! We seek to reform the Land of Wind! You think I'd let you get away?! You have nowhere to run… Divine Punishment! Take cover! Oh, you're back. Damn it… Be more careful. You wanted to talk to me? Please, Gaara, forget about
supervising the Chunin Exams. The people targeting you
are stepping up their efforts. You'll just be playing into
their hands if you continue this! I already know that. But if I quit because of that, it would be like declaring that
I will cave in under pressure. Maybe so, but… But this is only the Chunin Exams! The Chunin Exams is where
everything began for me. Thanks to him,
I've made it this far. I'll make sure these Chunin Exams
are a success… …without fail. We've finally reached
Hidden Sand territory. All right, let's go to
the second-round site. Sarutobi Sensei! Yuhi Sensei! Sorry, but this is as far as you'll go. Late arrivals are disqualified. If you're from the Hidden Leaf,
return to the village. The rest of you can disperse
from here too. But we ran nonstop for
three days to get here! If you're complaining, then maybe it's for the best
that you're being eliminated. That's because hell is beyond this point. And who knows if you'll even
get out of there alive. Sakura! Everyone!
You made it! I must admit,
Guy Sensei's team sure has stamina. Team Asuma, Team Kurenai… The main members from
that last time made it through. Yup! You all gave it your all! The fortitude you showed in running for
three days and three nights without sleep has made me so proud! Why, it takes me back to the time
I took the Chunin Exams… Sensei… If you're going to
tell us a long story… Please let us rest already.
I'm starving. Seems like it. We've never been to
the Hidden Sand before… It really is nothing but desert. To be accurate,
this really isn't Hidden Sand Village. It's quite far from the village. Neji, have you ever been to
the Hidden Sand Village? Once on an errand for the Hyuga. This is the Demon Desert checkpoint. I see. So this is what they're using. Taking the Exams in a different village
is sort of nerve-wracking. I wonder what
the second round will be like. It's probably like
last time. So we'll be battling teams
from other villages? There's a good chance of that. Then we'll have to be wary
of some teams. We went at full-speed,
yet we weren't the first to arrive. The Hidden Waterfall were
the first to arrive. Not only that,
they got here long before us. Just what kind of opponents
are they? C'mon, open up! What's going on?
The door won't open! Sorry, Fuu. Stay in there until morning. Huh?! Why's that? We never know what you'll do next. So please, give us a break and
let us rest up for the next round. Huh? Hey! That means I can't go and
have fun with the others! See, that's what worries us. Dinner is ready. Entrants, please assemble
in the cafeteria. So that's Hidden Sand Village… Check out the Hidden Sand…
giving everyone the stink eye. They sure look mean. Well, Kiba… You look pretty mean too. And over there
are the Hidden Rain. I guess the other side
is the Hidden Grass. That guy's amazing. I'll say. Compared to him, even
our slightly chubby Choji looks normal. But the way he sweats… Seriously, that's gross. Hey… I'm getting a bad feeling… Bad feeling? All that sweat. If he gets close to the food… All right! Time to eat dinner! At this rate… Our dinner will be… Damn! Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! S-Saved… Uh… I do not think so. What did you do to our dinner? What are you thinking? What did you do to our friend?! Don't misunderstand! We wanted to protect our food! So you were going to save your food
and never mind the rest of us, right? What're you saying?! We'd never stoop to
something like that! Your suspicion shows that
Gaara hasn't trained you right! Did you just criticize Lord Gaara? That is absolutely unforgivable! Stop! Please stop, everyone! Hey, stop it! Neji! Aren't you going to stop them? Sorry, but I'm busy right now. Burami! Don't eat food off the ground! Muyami! You help too! I'll pass… I'm too shy. Calm down, every—! Do not fight—! Why you…! Will you stop…and listen to me?! This room is way too small for
a flashy move like that. I didn't do that at full strength,
but still… To be able
to stop me with one hand… What's that sound? Fuu! Ta-dah! So the party's already started, guys?! I wonder if I can make a hundred friends? Wh-Who are you? I'm Fuu from the Village Hidden
in the Waterfall! This one… I came to the Chunin Exams
to make a hundred friends! So guys, what's the plan
after dinner? Cards? Backgammon? Musical chairs? Or… How about we all take
a bath together? What's with you? Oh well, so much for dinner… I'm going back. Huh? Hey… W-Wait! Don't go! Hey guys, play with me! Well… It took an idiot like that
to stop the ruckus… Sort of reminds me of someone. I know… Naruto. Right, Lee? Huh? Lee? Excuse me, please wait! I realized it when
I made contact earlier. You are not like the others. You stopped my attack
with such ease. It may sound arrogant
coming from me, but it takes someone
extraordinary to do that. That's why I can tell… That you have had to overcome
great odds like me. What are you trying to say? Well…that you and I are alike. I know about you. You're Rock Lee of the Hidden Leaf. I'm Shira of the Hidden Sand. Shira… I don't know what it is you sensed, but dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless. Because, for all of one's flaws
and suffering, we have just one life. To me, there is only one truth in life. One truth in life? Determination never betrays you. Shira… Lady Tsunade, I've returned. I'm glad you made it back.
So how did it go? As I reported, I wasn't able
to see Hanzo in person. I intended to sneak back in and investigate, but… The infiltrator must be around here! Find him! What? They've discovered
my presence already? They were on to me from the start. It was almost as though… ghosts were watching me. Well… I was expecting just
the usual Chunin Exams, But now that it's started, we're discovering some
interesting things about each village. Interesting things? Choji… What are you doing? Ino… What's that building? Oh, that's where the Senseis
are staying. The Senseis?! Hey, Choji! I'll bet they'll give us some food
if we go there! We're not supposed to
wander around at night! He's so hungry,
he can't think straight! Let's go after him! Choji! Where are you?! – Choji?!
– Choji?! Friends... Byakugan! What is that shadow? Whose voice was that?! No way… Did someone go outside? What? Oh! Cards? Backgammon?! Giant scorpions come out at night
during this time of year! That's why you were told
not to go outside! You have things like that?! Hey! Choji! I'm here to help you! What is this thing?! Hidden Waterfall Hurricane! Yahoo! This is fun! No! Stop! W-What's happening?! Hey! Stop fooling around,
and take that thing down! Huh? It's over already…?! It's dangerous! Aww… Guess I have no choice! Sakura, are you all right? Yeah… But you're bleeding! I'm okay. Please don't move. This girl… She's a Medical Ninja like me… That should do it. Thank you. She's got skill. Yahoo! Yahoo yahoo-hoo! Jeez… What a pain… Her again… How'd she show up so fast? And she brought down
that monster in no time. W-What is this?! What's going on? Going outside at night is prohibited. The Second Exam begins
before dawn breaks! Hurry up and return
to your quarters! – We're sorry.
– Guy Sensei! W-We're starving! You guys are… Go back now! Clear your mind of mundane thoughts
and even a fire will go out! Missing one meal won't kill a person! Just think of this
as part of training! Huh? Huh? Huh?! You're all leaving? I'm so sad… You're a good person.…
To help foes from other villages. If you had ignored them, you would've
ended up with fewer rivals. I don't care about rivals or allies. I wonder if I'm going to make
a hundred friends! Hey, let's be friends! Wanna play cards? Backgammon? Or…wanna bathe together?! They are the Lord Kazekage
and the jonin supervisors! Watch what you say! One hundred…! – Enough! Let's go back!
– …friends! Doesn't care about rivals or allies, huh. Sounds just like someone I know. Gaara? It's nothing. Now I have more to look forward to
in the Chunin Exams. Thanks to a few interesting
characters taking part in it. All right… I'm going to explain the second round
of the Chunin Exams. The Second Exam will be
a competition for scrolls to be held in the Demon Desert. In other words,
this is the ultimate survival battle! EARTH    HEAVEN

There are two scrolls,
Heaven and Earth. Half the teams will be
given Heaven scrolls. The other half will get Earth scrolls. The objective of this exam is to obtain both the Heaven
and Earth scrolls and to bring them back
to the base located in the center
of the Demon Desert. You have 72 hours. Find food on your own! Starting now,
there may be fatalities. Every participating team member
will sign a consent form! CONSENT FORM

When you turn in the team
consent forms, you will be given a scroll! Furthermore, to avoid confusion, each team will start from
a different location. So be quick,
and go to your starting points! It's finally starting… The second round
of the Chunin Exams! We don't know what lies ahead. So let's stay on our toes. – Right!
– Okay! Our priority is to find
the other scroll.

 To do that, we're going to have
to fight another team for it.

 We were fortunate that brawl happened
in the cafeteria last night.

 We have to watch out for
the one who stopped your kick,

 Shira, and his team, and…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Survival in the Demon Desert"


 …the team from the Hidden Waterfall!

SURVIVAL IN THE DEMON DESERT


 Tune in again!

 Demon Desert Survival

 For the next three days, I'm going to
give it everything I've got… for Lord Gaara. Lord Gaara, putting up
your Sand Guard won't help you train! Sorry… My Sand Guard is
an automatic response and I'm not conscious of it. Your Sand is like armor. Even if your armor is solid, you'll sustain damage if
your taijutsu within you is weak. You must stay on the offensive
and maintain your breathing. Then your body will move naturally. Now try defending yourself even
before your Sand Guard activates. I am impressed, Lord Gaara. You've progressed so much
in such a short time. Once you master taijutsu,
you will be able to combine it with your Sand Guard and
make it even more formidable. It's only because I have
such a fine teacher. Shira, are you going to
take the Chunin Exams? Yes. I'm eternally grateful for
the opportunity you have given me. It's only natural since
you have the skills. In time, you will become
a great shinobi of the Sand. It's finally here!
The Chunin Exams! I'm getting antsy. It's too soon to get nervous. Our goal isn't simply to
pass the Chunin Exams… But to have as many Sand entrants
as possible pass. It's my way of
repaying Lord Gaara. I think you're more stressed out
than we are. I want to live up to
Lord Gaara's expectations. By the way, this year's Chunin Exams
are shorter than last time. It's three days this time
as opposed to five days. Which simply means this place
is that much more dangerous. When the sun rises,
the temperatures soar in the desert. And getting around will
become much more difficult. I see… We might have barely
enough time to make it to the goal. So we can't stop for anything. Anyway, our priority is
to acquire the other scroll. To do that, we'll have
to battle a team for it… But we can't just pick any team. I came up with something. When did you…? Yesterday's brawl in the cafeteria
was a fortunate turn of events. I was able to get a rough idea
of the other teams' strengths. The teams to watch are… the one with Shira,
the guy who stopped your kick, Lee. And... The team from the Hidden Waterfall. With our skills, we should have no problem
with the rest of the teams. You're amazing, Neji! You analyzed all that already?! So we'll avoid
the strong teams and aim for
the weaker ones, right? I do not like doing things
in that way... I figured you'd say that. But we've waited two and a half years
for these Chunin Exams. You don't want to fail, do you? Of course not… But I… Determination never betrays you. I… I want to fight that guy! There's the signal to start. Let's go! So, what do we do? We were told not to enter
the Demon Desert... I have a message
from Lady Tsunade. What is it? I'll read it. "According to intel from agents
who just returned," "opposition forces have been
on the move recently" "in the Land of Wind." In other words, they are
the anti-Gaara faction. An assassination attempt
has already occurred. In spite of this, supervisors from
other villages are prohibited from entering the Demon Desert… and Gaara himself intends to supervise
the Second Exam as a proctor. Needless to say,
the danger is enormous if Gaara plans to
set himself up as a decoy. Not only to Gaara,
but to the Hidden Leaf. If anything happens to Gaara, our alliance with the Hidden Sand
will become rocky. Guy… Asuma… Kurenai… Sneak into the Demon Desert
and investigate the Hidden Sand. "If Gaara's safety is threatened,
protect him!" Gaara's assassination…? Gaara himself is the decoy…? The Hidden Sand must be
at their wit's end… Whatever happens,
let's protect the Kazekage! – Right.
– Yes. Scatter! Your eyesight is amazing. Imagine being able to see
what's being reflected on a water droplet dozens
of kilometers away. Once she gets a fix
on the relay point, she can see several
dozen kilometers out. But when the sun is out,
the water droplets evaporate, so I can't use it for too long. Found them! That's the team from
the Hidden Leaf! The Hidden Sand is
close by too! Tell them to keep their distance. Right. It's a signal from Shira. Well? Do you see anyone? Nope, there's no one. There has to be.
We've run quite far. What's going on? Why can't I find anyone
with my Byakugan? Neji, Tenten… Come here! What is it, Lee? I'm positive this is my kunai. What?! Just in case we got lost,
I stuck a few kunai into the rocks. Finding this means… We've been running
around in circles… Could this be a genjutsu? No way! We haven't even
confronted the enemy! – Release!
– Release! I knew it… What's going on?! There! I found them! Let's hurry! According to Shira, there are some pesky
Leaf shinobi nearby! Why should we listen
to a guy like that?! He's useful to us now. We can thank him later…
to our heart's content! Damn… They found us! We don't need to be nice
to these guys, right? We'll take their scroll! – Right!
– Right! Here I go! Leaf… Whirlwind! Datsuji! Goji! You're already within my range. And I'm going to deal
with you swiftly. Eight Trigrams… Two Palms! What?! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! 64 Palms! He blocked every hit?! Shira! We'll handle them. Leave while you can. I cannot believe I get
to fight you so soon! Hey! What are you
so happy about?! Lee! Don't take him on carelessly! Oh, my… The Cactus Genjutsu
was broken already? Cactus Genjutsu? Back then, I did catch
the faint scent of plants... That was the genjutsu? We knew the second round would take place
in the Demon Desert. So we set up several jutsu
in advance. Don't hold it against us… that we have an advantage. But not this time! I don't know about that. I'm very cautious. So I wonder what it means… that I appeared before you? Huh?! What?! I can't move… Not again?! This time, I'll release it for you. Release! Sorry, but I don't have time
to deal with you guys now. Please wait! Shira! Why won't you fight me? You're strong. I knew that
the moment I took your hit. That's why I won't fight. If we fight, one of us will get hurt. A shinobi fights regardless
of the risk! I have an important goal
right now. That goal is to make sure Hidden Sand entrants
make it through the Exams. You're helping… …other entrants? Instead of asking questions, you should worry
about yourselves. Let's go, Sen, Yome. Shira! This sand…is moving! Help me, Lee! Wait… I can't get loose…! Don't struggle!
You'll get buried even deeper! It seems I miscalculated
our strategy. What do you mean? Last night… He was also analyzing
the Hidden Leaf's strengths. They've had us under
surveillance from the start! Not only that, he took command over
the other Hidden Sand entrants, and ordered them not
to confront us. That's why we didn't
come across anyone! That Shira is not only skilled...
he's smart! This is not the time
to be impressed! Can't you hear this noise? Damn, so this is what
he was talking about! We're going to fall! We're going to die! We're going to die! Eight Inner Gates!
The Gate of Rest! Open! Is everyone okay? Yeah, we made it. But where are we? There's no way out
of this waterfall. What?! So we have to wait until
someone comes to rescue us?! No way! Does that mean
we're disqualified?! Is everyone safe? What about them? We took care of them. They fell into
the Sand Waterfall Pit. They won't be able to get out
until after the Exams are over. I see. That's a relief. Now's our chance. Get scrolls
from the other teams. Yeah, and we're taking
one right now. What's the big idea? Like we said. We're going to get one
from you guys. Why?! That's easy to answer, Shira. Because we don't like you. What did you want
to talk about? We want to help to
make sure everyone passes. Your team and ours will
start out close to each other for the Second Exam. However, a Hidden Leaf team that includes a Byakugan user
will also be near. They are strong. So what? The chances are high
that one of our teams will confront the Hidden Leaf
team in the beginning. This team is not
to be taken lightly. We'll impede them. During this time, I want you to get as far away
from them as possible. Oh… In other words,
you're going order us around? I just want the Sand to pass.
As many as possible. That's all. That's my way of
repaying Lord Gaara! Lord Gaara, huh…? That just doesn't sit well
with us. That a guy like you
who wasn't a shinobi until just recently… caught Lord Gaara's eye
and has the nerve, to act all high and mighty
towards us! Do you realize Shira
saved you earlier?! Well, we don't owe him… a damn thing! Wait! I have no intention
of fighting you! Maybe not you…but we sure do! You're just too good
with the fan… Using it even in combat to
control your Genjutsu Powder. But without it,
you're no match for me. You squirmy little—! I learned from Shira too! I can use this Evasion Jutsu
better than anybody! I know your moves like
the back of my hand! However… Your weakness is...
your eyes that see too well! IDIOT
 I-idiot? Idiot! My eyes… My eyes! Yome! Sen! Yome! Don't move! If you do, we'll shoot! Shira! It's over, Shira! Don't ever show
your face again! Die! Leaf...Hurricane! Rotation! You guys are—! Shira and his team are useless. But with the six of us… Sorry, but we're out of here. What?! Let's retreat! Shira! Are you all right?! You… Why…? I thought you fell into
the Sand Waterfall Pit? Oh, that was nothing. Y-You're pretty good. But why did you save us? We're not so shameless as to torment opponents
who have been weakened. Anyway, thank you. Can you explain something? Why would your own comrades
do this to Shira, who protected them? Well… Shira wasn't a shinobi
until just recently. Wasn't a shinobi? Someone of his skill? Perhaps that's due to
his circumstances. Do you know something, Lee? Shira has almost no skill
in ninjutsu or genjutsu. Shira and I are alike… We're shinobi who can
only perform taijutsu. I am raging with anger!

 Shira has been through
way more than I have.

 Why do you all insult him?

 You are comrades from
the same village!

 Please apologize to Shira.

 Until you apologize,

 I'll never…!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"As a Taijutsu User"


 I'll never forgive you!

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,300
Kabuto, I'll tell you
about this kid later... More importantly... Why don't you call over
the three little mice behind you? <i>So he's seen through
<i>everything, huh...?</i> <i>There's the signal!</i> You again, huh...? I've seen that face often... And it looks like
the Nine-Tails kid is here, too... Maybe I'll play with
you guys a little. Let's see who's become stronger...
you or Sasuke. Give Sasuke... back...! "Give him back" is not the correct
way of saying it, Naruto... Your reasoning is off... Sasuke came to us
because he wanted to. For a man, you're too obsessed...
about the past. You need to resign yourself. Shut up, four-eyes! You don't even know
how Naruto feels... Stop acting so cold
about everything! If you want to know about Sasuke, try forcing it out of me... If you can, that is... <i>The Nine-Tails Unleashed


</i> <i>Naruto...
<i>What is this?!</i> <i>What is that?</i> I see... So it appeared just as I thought... Judging from the shape
of the Chakra, the number of tails will probably
continue to grow...and eventually... there will be nine. That's about the size of it... Master Jiraiya, how many tails
have you seen? I've come close... to dying twice... The first time, I broke
six ribs and both arms, and several of my
internal organs ruptured... It was when I tried to peek into
the women's bath at a hot spring and you pounded me good, Tsunade... The other time was... during Naruto's training when I saw the fourth tail
of the Nine-Tails Chakra. His anger became the trigger and the number of Fox Spirit tails
he grew increased. He maintained consciousness up
until the third Fox Spirit tail. But by the fourth tail, he had lost all rationality and was
controlled by destructive impulses. He was just like a small version
of the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit. Even with the
Fourth Hokage's seal it can go that far? Yes. I don't know the details,
but I can say this for certain: The Fourth Hokage's Sealing Jutsu
might very well... be weakening. The Fourth Hokage's Sealing Jutsu...? I can't believe it... There's more... It may appear that when Naruto
is in the Nine-Tails state, he's being protected by
the Nine-Tail's Cloak... But in actuality, his body was
continuing to suffer damage from the Nine Tail's Cloak itself. After the fourth tail formed, his body, wrapped in the Nine-Tail's
Cloak, grew bloodied, and he thrashed about
despite suffering serious injuries. After the Nine-Tail's Cloak
dissipated, his wounded body was healed by the Nine-Tails Chakra
inside his body. But if he continues to get hurt and then heal at that
speed over and over... Naruto's body will break down
and his life span will shorten. That's why we need you...
Yamato! You, who has inherited the cells
of the First Hokage. Now you're the only one... who can control
the Jinchuriki Host. Fortunately for us, Naruto happens to be wearing
the First Hokage's necklace... <i>We're counting on you...</i> Naruto... you've grown considerably
as a Jinchuriki Host. <i>The power of the Nine-Tails
<i>is rapidly getting stronger...</i> The striking feature of
the "Jinchuriki Host" is how it utilizes unbelievable power
by resonating with the "Tailed Beast." <i>Naruto...</i> You're starting to become more like
a Jinchuriki Host, aren't you... Naruto? <i>I get it...</i> So that's why you were chosen to
keep watch over him, huh? So my experiment turned out
to be somewhat useful... <i>Experiment...?</i> The Leaf should be thanking me
a little more for this... Don't you agree... my adorable little test subject...? Test subject? Who the heck is this person? It happened... a long time ago when I was
still in the Hidden Leaf Village... I wanted the power of
the First Hokage, the only one among all Shinobi
who could use the Wood Style Ninjutsu and control Tailed Beasts at will. I once conducted an experiment
where I took some DNA information... from the remains of the First Hokage
and implanted genetic components... from that DNA into
the cells of sixty children. But their bodies
violently rejected it, and they died while
kicking and struggling... Around the time when
I was about to give up, I ended up being tracked by
another one of my experiments and had to leave the village... leaving my laboratory just as it was. I thought all the test
subjects had died... but I never thought one of them
would still be alive. <i>I get it...</i> Four-Pillar Prison Jutsu! <i>Th-This is...the secret Jutsu that only
<i>the First Hokage could use.</i> <i>The Wood Style Ninjutsu!</i> <i>How come Captain Yamato can use
<i>the Wood Style Ninjutsu?</i> <i>So that's why he can use
<i>the Wood Style</i> <i>that only the First Hokage
<i>could use...</i> <i>So that's the story...</i> I see... So it looks like we'll now
be able to obtain a sample from a product
of old research. More important than that... I'd like to test out how strong
my Sasuke has become... by having him
fight against Naruto. He doesn't... He doesn't belong to you...! Don't talk about Sasuke... in front of me... like he belongs to you! That's... <i>What's...that Chakra?!</i> <i>The air stings...</i> Interesting... <i>No doubt about it.</i> <i>It's the Nine-Tail's Cloak...
<i>Three tails have formed...</i> <i>Th-That's...the power of
<i>the Jinchuriki Host...</i> <i>I can feel it in my bones...
<i>This...</i> <i>This terrifying Chakra...</i> <i>is not the kind that
<i>can be controlled!</i> <i>This is...Naruto Uzumaki's...</i> <i>the Nine-Tail's power, huh?</i> What power! To think there'd be that much
power just with Chakra... And on top of that, he rampages
letting his emotions take over. It's as if he's not seeing
what's around him. That power of his is a problem, but this difficult situation is
a great opportunity for me. Failure will not be tolerated. My true mission assigned to me by
my Lord Danzo is about to begin. Next episode:
"The Top-Secret Mission Begins" As a Taijutsu User

 Shira has almost no skill for
ninjutsu or genjutsu… Shira and I are alike… We're shinobi who
can only perform taijutsu. So you knew. I realized it yesterday
when we exchanged punches. Those who are skilled in ninjutsu
and genjutsu may not notice that slight, yet unique difference. I sensed that he was like me. Since you know that much,
let me explain. In Hidden Sand Village,
not even the previous Kazekage would allow people like Shira
to become shinobi. But that's—! Even a great taijutsu user
like Shira?! That's right. That's why until just recently… SHINOBI ACADEMY


Shira wasn't allowed to attend the Academy
and was treated like an outsider. Hey! What're you staring at?
You can't even use ninjutsu! Go away! Your uselessness is contagious! But Shira refused to give up
and believed in himself. He kept training all by himself
and honed his taijutsu. Then, the times changed… The seat was empty for a while after the Fourth Kazekage
passed away… but eventually Lord Gaara
became the Fifth Kazekage. Those who knew
Lord Gaara's past spread rumors that
our village was doomed, but that wasn't the case. Lord Gaara was receptive
to other people's opinions… and one by one, he did away with
the previous Kazekage's practices and instituted reforms. That's Lord Gaara? Yeah. He's the younger brother
of Temari, the girl we used to play with
when we were kids. What happened to the huge boulder
that was used to prevent sand erosion? Well… Bring me the one
who destroyed this. Are you Shira? You knew that boulder
was placed there to protect Hidden Sand Village. Why did you destroy it? I am very sorry. I had no intention of
destroying it. To me, that boulder was
an invaluable training partner. Are you saying you destroyed it
during training? I was told you are not
a student at the Academy. No. I don't have any skills in
ninjutsu or genjutsu. According to the village rules, someone like me is unfit
to be a shinobi. So you trained all by yourself? Interesting… I want to see which
is more valuable… That boulder or you! Your fist is splendid! Please forgive me! I can't begin to imagine
the effort it took for you, banned from the Academy, to hone
your skills to this level. I hereby abolish the rule established
by my predecessor. Shira, you will be a shinobi. I once met someone just
like you in Hidden Leaf Village. Over here! Through sheer perseverance,
he has become a fine shinobi. Shira, I predict you will become
as good a shinobi as he. That's how Shira finally
became a shinobi. Not only that… Lord Gaara recognized
Shira's character and chose him to be
his personal taijutsu coach. To be named the Kazekage's
taijutsu coach is a huge advancement! But this displeased many. When someone who until just recently
was below your rank attains great success,
people become jealous… I understand now. Changing people's perceptions
takes time. I see, so that's why Shira
said that to me… I don't know what it is you sensed, but dwelling on the misfortunes
of birth is meaningless. Because, for all one's flaws
and suffering, we have just one life. Shira, you persevered
so much, and yet… I'll never forgive the ones
who did this to you! Lee! That idiot… Don't tell me he's going to… I wasn't good at using
my chakra… so everyone belittled me… Stupid! There's no way
you'll become a ninja! There's no way a chump
who can't even use ninjutsu can become a ninja! Yes, I will! Whatever… The fact that you're even in
the academy is nonsense. You don’t have ninjutsu
or genjutsu skills, and your taijutsu is below average! Do you know what
everyone calls you here? All right, as of today,
you're all genin. So I'd like to know what it is
you're all aiming for! I don't want to answer… Sensei! I'd like to prove that I can
become a respectable shinobi even though I can't use
ninjutsu or genjutsu! That would mean everything to me! Hey! What's so funny?! If you can't use ninjutsu
or genjutsu, you're already out as a ninja. Lee, you just won't learn
your lesson, will you? There's no way you can win. Unlike you, Neji is… …a genius. It’s useless, Lee… No matter how much effort
you make, there's no way you can
take me down. That’s just fact. Yes! Yes! Yes! If I can't do 500 push-ups, I'll jump rope
and do 1200 double unders! If I can't do that,
I'll log kick 2000 times! 1116…1117… Lee! Are you taking
a break already? What is it, Guy Sensei? If it's about my blunder during
the recent mission, I believe I have already apologized! Lee, it's true you're different
from Neji. You have no ninjutsu
or genjutsu skills, and you're no taijutsu expert either… But Lee… You have powers
that can exceed Neji's… You're a genius with
hidden potential. If you're trying to
make me feel better, please stop. I'm not trying to make you feel better
or anything! The reason is that you are… a genius of hard work! There's no point in
working hard if you don't believe in yourself! I hung in there because
I believe in myself. Shira… You're just like me! In fact, since you weren't able
to attend the Academy, you must have trained
much harder than me! I won't forgive the ones who
were contemptuous of your efforts! This is—! Damn it… If you guys hadn't run off,
we could've obtained a scroll. That team with the Byakugan user
is the one Shira warned us about. Better safe than sorry. By the way, they're not coming
after us, are they? I used all those Paper Bombs, and that area has a lot
of underground caverns… The explosions created
a steeper cliff than I expected. It'll take them a while
to make their way across. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Who's there?! The handsome blue beast of
the Hidden Leaf, Rock Lee! You're that guy from earlier! What you did to Shira
is unforgivable! Please apologize to Shira! Apologize to Shira? This guy's from the Hidden Leaf and
he's siding with Shira?! When you believe
in hard work and perseverance, it doesn't matter whether
you're a friend or foe! That’s beside the point!
How’d you get across that chasm?! I have invisible wings known
as perseverance! Sometimes, perseverance… will turn into infinite wings that
make the impossible possible! Until you apologize to Shira,
my rage will not subside! Like hell we will! We know your weakness! Wind Style! Sandstorm Hurricane! This is genjutsu! Like Shira, you only specialize
in taijutsu. So we'll just capitalize
on your weaknesses! That's cowardly! Please fight me fair and square! What's cowardly?! It's your fault for not knowing ninjutsu! Inside the Sandstorm Hurricane,  countless sand particles
collide against each other and create powerful
electro-magnetic waves. Because of that, anyone caught inside it will continue
to experience genjutsu. It's about time to finish this! What?! Neji! Jeez! Are you crazy
taking on six by yourself? Tenten! You two made it
across too! If you made it, isn't it obvious
we would too?! Damn it… We're a team!
Don't go off on your own! I'm sorry! I just couldn't stand it… Well, we have no choice now. Let's go, Tenten! That's more like it! 8 Trigrams…64 Palms! What’s their deal? They’re ridiculously strong! I would like some payback as well! Great Leaf Whirlwind! Wait, Lee! Please forgive them. Shira…! Why? Why would you defend them?! They betrayed you and
put you through hell! Maybe they did.
But it doesn't matter. How can you say
it doesn't matter?! If they won't acknowledge me,
I have only myself to blame. That's all. I already told you. Whatever my flaws
and misfortunes, this is the life I was born into. I'm not bitter, and I bear no grudge. Good or bad, this is my life. I have only myself to blame
for the bad because I didn't work hard enough. I don't want to blame anyone
for the life I have. Shira… How can you say
you didn't work hard enough? Shira! You are a man among men! The shinobi among shinobi! I've never been so moved
in my life! Other than Guy Sensei,
I've never met anyone so amazing! You get so carried away. It was really touching,
until you ruined the mood. Take this. This way, at least one of
our teams will pass. Damn it… Must you be so kind? Put yourself in our shoes, will you? Sorry. Why are you apologizing? You're right. But if you take this,
what about you guys…? We'll figure something out. Why would you go so far? Is it all for Lord Gaara? Until recently, he was
a brutal shinobi who'd kill anyone. People don't change so easily! I realize that. But Lord Gaara and I
are the same… That's what I believe. I can tell from training with him. Lord Gaara bitterly regrets
his past actions. And he knows that atonement
won't come easy. And yet, Lord Gaara keeps
pushing forward. Because despite what
people think of him… he believes that persevering
is the best thing to do right now. I don't care about
who I am right now… As long as I'm not ashamed of
the man I am in the future. Oh, the words that come out
of your mouth! You're absolutely right! What counts is the man
that you are in the future! Okay, okay…
We heard you, pipe down! We…can't accept that. Hey, give him your scroll. Why?! We have our pride too. We lost this battle. So we're handing you our scroll. But we're not about
to give up just yet. We’ll prove it by obtaining the scrolls
from the other teams. Let's go! Why did they...? They realized that they don’t want to
be ashamed of themselves in the future. Shira! Um… Thank you. Thanks to you, it looks like Shira will
have a place in the Hidden Sand. We didn't do anything. Shira did it with his own strength and
a little help from our taijutsu-idiot. He’s very honest…
He might be a little like our Shira. Uh, I don't think so. His weird clothes, his hair,
or his eyebrows… They're not alike at all! That’s true... He’s right up there
with Naruto in stupidity. Naruto? A shinobi from our village.
He’s on a journey right now. We’ve heard of him. Lord Gaara speaks of a shinobi
who changed him. I'm sure the name was Naruto. I wonder what he's up to now? Neji… Tenten… This has nothing to do
with the Second Exam… But I have a favor to ask. Uh-oh… Here we go… I never want to go through
something like last time! Sasuke beat Gaara of the Sand
against whom I was no match… And Naruto beat Neji
whom I longed to defeat… Why? Why does it always
turn out like this? You wouldn't have listened to us
even if we tried to stop you, right? Right! Shira! I want to fight you! Because we both seek
to master taijutsu, please fight me! If I can face you in battle, I'll have no regrets from
these Chunin Exams! Fine with me, Lee. To be honest,
I've wanted to fight you! Shira! I will show you
how serious I am!

 This is my last fight.

 Last?

 Lee, it’s all because of you,
that I can be a shinobi.

 I’m grateful to you.

 It might have been your fists
that changed Lord Gaara.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Ultimate"

 Let me express my gratitude
to you with my seriousness!


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS
~ The PATH TRAVELED
THE ULTIMATE


 Tune in again!


 The Ultimate


 Huh?! PERSEVERANCE I didn't know Lee kept going
with that training. We're in the middle
of the Chunin Exams! What is he thinking? Shira! I will show
you how serious I am! Let me warn you… Shira's super strong! I've become strong too! This is my last fight. Last? Here I come, Lee! What is this?
Their speed is ridiculous! A battle of powerful fists… It's not something
you get to see often. He stopped my jutsu. He countered every move?! If I could, I would have liked
to fight him too. Amazing… I haven't faced
a taijutsu user this strong since Guy Sensei and Neji! He has a fine technique… I feel his passion in
every punch he throws. The intensity of his training
comes across clearly. Lee! I'm grateful to you. Perhaps it's all because of you
that I can be a shinobi. Lord Gaara said
this to me back then… I once met someone just like you
in Hidden Leaf Village. Through sheer determination,
he has become a fine shinobi. Shira… I predict you will be
as good a shinobi as he. It might have been your fists
that changed Lord Gaara. No, I had nothing to do with that! It was your perseverance
that moved Lord Gaara. Lee, I'm going to show you
my gratitude in earnest! Well said! That is the creed
of those of us who are dedicated to
the mastery of taijutsu. They seem to be enjoying this. Maybe Lee has met someone
he can consider a true rival. You can only go so far
training alone. Having a rival is what
helps you surpass those limits. I see. Do you have a rival, Neji? My rival? I don't know what
the Hyuga destiny of hatred is! But if you're going to
say it's futile, you don't have to do anything! After I become the Hokage… I'll change the Hyuga! You're the only one
who can be my rival… So hurry up and
come home, Naruto! Neither one of them has delivered
a decisive blow yet. They're just sizing
each other up right now. What? They're not fighting at
their full potential? It's more like 50%. How much can a body endure? If they stay evenly matched like this… No… They're not quite equal. Huh? They're not? They're equal in speed and in
the number of moves they have… But Shira's physique is
a full size bigger than Lee's. In boxing, the difference
in body weight influences the intensity of the blow. While they may look
evenly matched, Lee with his smaller build… Is sustaining more damage? Lee should be feeling
the effects pretty soon. Blow for blow, Shira's punches
are harder than mine! At this rate… Lee! That stance! Don't tell me Lee plans
to use the Lotus! It's too dangerous! But he is an opponent
who is worth that risk! No way!
The First Gate won't open! Why?! You hit my Chakra Points and
stopped the flow of chakra! As a taijutsu user like you, I know all your strengths
and weaknesses. As well as the fact that you are
versed in the secret jutsu, the Eight Inner Gates! From now, I mean business! Shira switched his mode. He's getting serious now! Here I come, Lee! What's happening?! All of a sudden, his attacks
became relentless and accurate! This is—! The sound! Sound?! His attacks are silent! We taijutsu users can
counter supersonic moves because we have honed
our five senses. One of those senses
is hearing. I remember… Lee said he once fought a shinobi
from the Hidden Sound who gave him a hard time! This time, it's the exact opposite! Shira is making absolutely no noise! But how…? Byakugan! I see! It's the theory of the owl. The owl? Did you know that owls fly
without making a sound? Owls have special
comb-like feathers that muffle the sound
of their flapping wings. Using chakra that can only
be used with taijutsu, he's cloaked himself with
the same type of feathers. To come up with something
like that all by himself… What a waste to consider
someone like that an enemy. Silent Fist! See if you can take this, Lee! How can I…? There's no point in working hard
if you don't believe in yourself! Yes! I've trained and worked
just as hard as Shira! 999…1000! Now, 1000 sit-ups! Are you serious? I am serious! Wait, wait, wait! Enough bodybuilding! You're in far better physical
condition than we are, Lee. But Guy Sensei, I've never beaten
you or Neji even once! That's because
you don't use this. Use my head for taijutsu? Certainly! It can be said that
mental visualization is a fundamental part of taijutsu. When I weave a sign,
I'm already seeing 100 moves ahead. What?! Is such a thing possible?! Yes, it's possible! Through visualization alone,
if I'm going to fight Kakashi, I can now see
1000 moves ahead. Th-That far? Hey, is that true? Who knows? For example, if I attack
with a right seiken fist… Lee, what would your 50th move be? Huh? What technique is your 50th move! Well… Let's see… A right thrust! Wrong! Then… A clockwise kick! Correct! So what is your 100th move?! Uh… A left heel kick! Wrong. The answer is
a counter-clockwise kick. What? I will prove it to you right now! Ready? 48… 49… 50. Continue! Sensei was right! 98… 99…! 100! Right again! I see… He's making that happen! Huh? That's amazing, Guy Sensei! What's your trick? It's not a trick. I just made you move the way
I wanted you to. That's all. Made me move? Yes! I used counters that forced you
to make certain moves. In battle, there is a sequence
to techniques and jutsu. When you are in control
of that flow, predicting what comes next
is not difficult. Right now, I'm controlling
the flow of battle, and as a result, you, my opponent who's physically
stronger than me, have lost steam before me! That's true! Guy Sensei, you're not
even breathing hard! By controlling the flow of battle, I was able to deplete your energy
while preserving my own. There really aren't many chances to
take down a foe in the midst of battle. The usual attack strategy is no more than
an attempt to create such a chance! That's what I mean
by using your head! That's right! From opponents I've faced before,
I pretty much know Shira's pattern. All I need to do is control the sequence
of my opponent's moves. Then, even if his moves are silent, I can anticipate Shira's fist! All right! What?! Lee's not getting hit anymore! Finally, Lee…
You remembered that training! He's countering so fast! I can't wait to see when
he's giving it his all! He missed the Chakra Point! What's going on? Was it by chance? At this point… Guy Sensei would be able to activate
the Sixth Gate instantly… That's impossible for me, however… The Third Gate of Life! Open! He went straight to
the Third Gate… So Lee's trained that far! So that's the rumored
Eight Inner Gates... Well then… Seven Heavenly Breaths!
First Activation! Second Activation! Third Activation! What is that?! It's a taijutsu breathing method
that Shira came up with. It's a jutsu whereby inhaling
large amounts of oxygen invigorates the entire body. When performing this technique, Shira's lung capacity increases
nearly fourfold. So it's his version of
the Eight Inner Gates. It's amazing that he came up
with that all by himself… Those two really drive home the fact… that there is no limit
to perseverance. No kidding! Lee! Shira! Do your best, both of you! Here I come, Shira! Anytime! Not yet! Fourth Gate of Pain! Open! Fifth Gate of Closing! Open! So this is what you're like
when you're serious! My chakra…my sound-muffling feathers
are being blown away! I'm starting to hear…
the sound of your wings. Leaf Hurricane! I'm not done yet… Shira's wound has opened up! Shira! Shira! Are you okay, Shira?! Yeah… I guess we'll have to
postpone this match. Lee, I envy you. I wish I could have trained under
Guy Sensei at least once. Shira… Why did you release
my Chakra Points? So you noticed? I wanted to fight you when you could give
a hundred percent. As I expected, you are strong. It was a great experience. What are you saying? You were too reckless! Shira, I want you to have this. Guy Sensei gave it to me. This is what made me strong. It is a unique item with
superior breathability and moisture-wicking qualities
that lets you move easily! You'll see the difference
when you train! You'll get attached
to it immediately! Wear this…
and we'll be brothers! Thanks… I accept it. Shira… You said earlier
that this is the last time… In the Land of Wind, there is a battalion that guards
the northern border. That battalion never leaves
its station. The environment there
is extremely harsh, so few candidates
are willing to accept that mission. I plan to volunteer for it
if I pass these Exams. It's near my hometown. My parents are sick and
I want to be close to them. So I probably won't see
any of you again. I see how it is... Shira… I had no idea. I guess that means I won't
be seeing you around either, Yome. You're probably going
to tag along, right? I have no regrets with my life. But I'm sure my life would
have been more interesting if I had had a friend like you. I'm going to remember that as
the greatest compliment from you! And I mean it as such, Lee,
in all sincerity. Now we have two scrolls! Then let's head straight
for home base! HEAVEN      HEAVEN So, when should I break
the news to them...? FUU TOCCHI KUN

According to reports from
the investigative team, FUU TOCCHI KUN

two members of Team Fuu
from the Hidden Waterfall… FUU TOCCHI KUN

Tocchi and Kun…
are actually not genin. It is believed they are jonin
named Kegon and Yoro. Damn Hidden Waterfall… What are they scheming? Wait. Let me handle this. This information is not
to go out of this room. – But!
– But! The Second Exam will
continue uninterrupted. Understood?! What is Lord Gaara thinking?! It will be sundown soon. Yes. From here, we'll be able to sense
the enemy's presence right away. It's the perfect spot to make camp. So where's Fuu? Hey! She was over there
just a second ago… Fuu! That brat! She's so carefree! What the—?! Poke, poke! Fuu! Don't go off on your own! Damn it! What if someone from
another village attacked you? You are valuable to
the Hidden Waterfall…! Okay, I get it! I'll be right there! Jeez! If you make such a fuss,
you'll be discovered. Fuu… She's a... It's a good trick, eh?

 I thought we'd just wrap up
the second stage of the exams

 in a cool way, like this! 

 I think it's good!

 It's kind of like something
Naruto would do...or...

 This has nothing to do
with Naruto!

 I wonder if Naruto's training
right now?

 With this exam,

 I'm going to be a chunin
and get a leg up on him!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Escape vs. Pursuit"


 Let's go, Kurenai's Team 8!


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
ESCAPE VS. PURSUIT


 Tune in again!


 Escape vs. Pursuit

 It's a good trick, eh? I want to wrap things up
in a cool way for the Second Exam. Akamaru gave it his seal
of approval with his paws. It's not bad, but… I don't see what's so cool
about it. I think it's good! It's a little slow,
but it's trying hard to advance… It's kind of like something
Naruto would do…or… This has nothing to do
with Naruto! It's my idea, after all… You're right… But I wonder where
Naruto is training with Jiraiya Sensei around now? Who knows! What was that just now? Kiba? Anyway, who cares how he's training? Let's pass these Chunin Exams
and get a leg up on him! Let's go, Kurenai's Team 8! Damn scroll, damn scroll,
damn scroll… How can we be so unlucky? So what, Kazami? We get to hunt…
and I'm enjoying this. It's no fun, it's no fun, it's no fun! But I have a feeling… that Lady Luck will be on
our side next time! Burami, Muyami! We can do it! I know we can! We've got it! Three cheers for us! Hip, hip, hooray! Weren't you going
for a cool finish? I couldn't help it.
It didn't go right. We don't even know what kind
of scroll we're fighting for, and that's not cool. So what do you suggest? Hinata, can't you do something? You can, right? Like using your Byakugan
to search for Heaven scrolls. I can't go so far as seeing
what kind of scroll it is. Kiba! Hush! Do you think someone heard us? It's all right! You sure about that? Our hunch was right on target. Luck has smiled upon us! Fools! Those guys are
fools, fools, fools! Hidden Leaf rivals!
We heard you loud and clear! Now that's good to know. Otherwise, our little charade
would've been wasted... since we did it
just so you'd hear us. Since you fell for the bait
and showed up, your scroll must be… Heaven! What…? We both have
what the other wants. So let's get down to business…
and try to get it! Fine! We accept your challenge! You smell, don't you? You're thinking
the same thing too, right, Akamaru? This guy is strong. Ninja Art! Beast Mimicry. Man Beast Clone! Damn it! Well then… Fang Over Fang! This guy's belly…absorbs my attack
and fires it back! Byakugan! I see them… 361 chakra points… I'll make the first move! So this is the Hyuga's famed
Gentle Fist… Her goal is to pierce my pressure points
to manipulate my chakra… Well then, I'll just take
advantage of the air! He uses that flag to change the flow
and shape of the air currents… Will you cut through it? I'll crush you! Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms! Don't let this awkward silence
bother you. The reason is because, it's our first meeting and
there's nothing I want to ask you. I'm shy… so I'm going to excuse myself. All right! Come at me! Akamaru! Don't slam into him!
Just bite him! Ouch! I'm bleeding! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! All right! One more time! We got you! We got you! Thanks for the scroll! Damn it! Damn it! How the hell...?! First thing we did was to
watch you all battle and figure out who had
what scroll. It was easy… You put an unusual amount
of strength on your side. Once we knew who had
the scroll, we all attacked. They pulled a fast one on us. No way! It's all thanks to me. I'm the one who saw the scroll! It's because we had
a good combo! I did it! I did it! Shut up! That scroll belongs to us! Ninja Art… Smell Sphere! My body…is getting numb… I can't move… This shockwave feels like
it's piercing straight through my head. Akamaru and I can identify it. It's a scent…! It's something we've never
smelled before… It's an unbelievable scent explosion! It's a special scent that
I ferment inside my body. Want some more? Why you—! Kiba, you two…
With your keen sense of smell… this must be overpowering. Are you okay, Kiba?! Damn it… I'm not okay! My nose feels like
it's on fire…Oww! It's all thanks to me. I did this, right? Burami, get this through
your thick skull! It's because of our teamwork! Damn it! Akamaru! Kiba! What? You're not supposed
to be standing… You're not supposed
to be walking… So how? How? So they're not about
to give up yet, eh? That's their teamwork… I swear I'll get it back! That's our scroll! Right! We're not giving up
until we get it back! That's because we can't give up
on becoming chunin! So annoying. Summoning Jutsu! Moguranmaru! We're done with these guys! Let's get going. I want a ride too! Don't track any mud in here. It's so crowded…and it stinks! This is teamwork! Why you—!
Trying to run away?! I won't let you! Our team specializes in snatching
our target item in enemy territory and taking it home without fail. We got what we came for.
This battle is over. You guys can't touch us now. Bye! You guys! Stop! Hey! Well, that's fine with us. Brag all you want about
your ability to get away. Team Kurenai has the power
of sensory perception. We're pros at tracking! And we've got a cool guy who assesses every situation calmly
and initializes action! Shino! We're already in contact. That's because my insects
are attached to that mole. I attached female insects… and nothing will stop
the males of that species from chasing their delicate scent. My nose is still useless.
So is Akamaru's. We're counting on your insects! Don't worry.
I've got this covered. They're close! The mole is under there somewhere! All right! What is it, Ranmaru? Damn it! It sensed the insects! This is why I said not
to track in any mud! Ranmaru has really sensitive skin
and is a clean freak! They're escaping underground again! Damn! It's all right. We're close enough
that I can see them! They may be in the sand,
but I won't lose them! Hinata! Byakugan! I see them! Over at 10 o'clock! Got it! They're not getting away! They're turning towards 1 o'clock! Hinata! How close am I
to that mole?! Six meters! Akamaru! Man Beast Clone! Fang Over Fang! Target's changing directions! 10 o'clock, seven meters! I won't let ‘em get away! This time… I won't miss! Go straight on ahead! Five meters! Four meters! I'm gonna close in
just a bit more… Three meters! W-What…?! What is this? The sand is getting
softer and softer… What? Is this game of tag over already? This isn't good.
The sand is like… Yes, it's like a bottomless swamp… I'm sinking quickly… This is what they were after. And we fell for it…
hook, line and sinker. Akamaru! Sink! Sink! Sink! Hinata! So this is…it… Shino! No one will come after us now. Our team wins. Actually, I outshined the rest
of the team. It was all because my Moguranmaru
came through for us. You guys don't get it. In any case, it will be smooth ride
to the finish line. We just aced the Second Exam. Akamaru! Akamaru! Get a hold of yourself! Hey! Akamaru! Good boy, Akamaru! It was all thanks
to your Marking! That was really quick thinking! If we didn't smell like urine,
it would've been perfect… Don't worry, Akamaru. It's not too smelly.
I'm fine with it. No… It stinks. Kiba! My nose is working again. Hinata, can you pursue those guys
with your Byakugan? They're out of range
for my Byakugan… Well then… It's my turn! I smell them. It's the big guy's intense
body odor! We're not giving up! We'll chase them to the depths of hell
and definitely get the scroll back! – Right!
– Right! The scent's gone!

 Damn it!
 
 What do we do?

 There's no reason to despair.

 That's because if we lose
our sense of smell,

 we still have the sense of sight.

 But they're outside
the range of the Byakugan…

 Then we'll go to
the outermost range!

 Bugs… We're depending on you!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Unwavering Gutsiness"


 We'll get back both
the Heaven and Earth scrolls!


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
UNWAVERING GUTSINESS


 Tune in again!


 I just caught a whiff… You finally notice
what you smell like? Not me. When you deal with things
that smell, your nose becomes sensitive
to all kinds of scents. What do you smell? The loud-mouthed guy. I'd recognize
his mongrel smell anywhere. Them…?! Are you telling me they managed
to climb out of the sand?! It's more fun this way. We're back to the chase!
We can play tag! It's no fun for me at all. – No matter how hard they try,
– This place is so hot and open. – they can't catch up to us.
– Give me a nice corner to snuggle up in. Then let's do this. Poor Hidden Leaf. Bu…rami! All right… Let's cheer for Burami! Hip hip hurray! Burami! Hip hip hooray! Burami!
Hip hip hooray! Burami! I hate this so much! This will neutralize our smell. We're odorless. Their scent is gone! You too? Damn it! What'll we do? There's no reason to despair. That's because if we lose
our sense of smell, we still have the sense of sight. But they're outside the range
of the Byakugan! Then we have to get within range. We're counting on you, insects! Looks like they found
those guys up ahead. All right, just watch!
We're getting back the scroll… I mean, both the Heaven
and Earth scrolls! Unwavering Gutsiness

 There they are. Now it's their turn to sink into sand! Wait… I don't see their chakra. What? What do you mean? It's a mirage… Damn it… So they're fakes? The tower… Use your insects again, Shino… But there's no guarantee
we'll find the real guys. There's a chance
they'll reach the tower while we wait for
my insects to respond. Damn it! Why does his face
keep popping up? Kiba? We can't give up. Let's go after them. Even if we have no clue
where they are? Sure we have a clue! It's guaranteed they're heading
for the tower. And they're going to avoid
that bottomless swamp! It's a huge perimeter, I know…
But it's still a set range! Well, Hinata? Can you at least try
to get a direction? Okay, I'll try. Byakugan! Looks like there's lots
of quicksand in the northeast. The northwest is…
even more restricted. In comparison, the north-northeast
route looks safer… I'm in favor of heading
for the tower. There's also the chance
of finding others with the Heaven and Earth scrolls. We don't have to target
the Hidden Grass trio. Yes, we do! Those guys stole our scroll. I would… Naruto would absolutely
take it back from them! Naruto? I mean, never mind Naruto. You're right.
Naruto wouldn't give up. He would pursue them to
the ends of the earth… Forget Naruto! I'm not going to give up! Right, Naruto wouldn't give up. I said I'm not…! No, we won't. Shino… That's because Team 8 with
its sensory perception powers must never be beaten. Shino! All right! Let's show them
what we're made of! We're not letting them…
get away! I think we gave them the slip. What's wrong? It's those pesky guys again. I thought you erased our smell? I did… But it seems like
they can track by instinct. Then let's just take a detour. No, we can't underestimate them. Their persistence isn't ordinary. They must be really confident
about their tracking skills. So, what'll we do? You have me, so relax. Hip hip hooray, Burami! Here we…go! You too, Akamaru?! What is it, Kiba? It's that blubber man's smell! This way! You can try,
but you can't hide your smell! I'll be there…
You just wait. Kiba… As expected, a trap. The whole place reeks
with his smell. Which smell…
is that bastard's smell? His smell? They're on to us. Damn it! Damn it! Why was I able to
keep laughing? Why was I able to
get back up again? What enabled me to do
that back then? Naruto… Just when I thought
I caught up to him… He takes off to train
with Master Jiraiya… Damn it… Even I want… Listen, Akamaru… We're going to surpass
the Two-Headed Wolf. We're going to increase
the number of heads by a lot! And we'll call it the…
Multi-Headed Wolf! To do that… Shadow Clone Jutsu! W-What…?
I don't have… enough chakra! Okay, I get it. You're right… The more Shadow Clones,
the more chakra you use up. I wonder how much chakra
Naruto has? Damn it… It's no use. I've got to start with one,
then steadily increase it. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Let's do it, Akamaru! Counting you, we'll have three bodies! Three-Headed Wolf! – Inuzuka Style…
– Inuzuka Style… – Man Beast Transformation Combo!
– Man Beast Transformation Combo! – Three-Headed Wolf!
– Three-Headed Wolf! I can't even sustain my jutsu
when my chakra goes down by half… Steadily increase it?
Who am I kidding? Can I even do
a Three-Headed Wolf…? I have to do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! If I don't have enough chakra,
I'll increase it! I'll work on my stamina
and taijutsu to build up my basic strength! This is… Naruto! Blood, sweat… This place reeks
with Naruto's scent… Can you tell by this scent? Me too. I can tell just how hard
Naruto trained in here. I'm going to cover this place…
with our scent! Shadow Clone Jutsu! One more time, Akamaru! I won't give up! I'm never giving up! No way am I going to lose…
to that bastard! Three-Headed Wolf! Yeah, it's my… It's our scent! Damn… I can feel Naruto. He's laughing at us again… Asking if we're gonna give up… We're not giving up. It's okay…
Just give up! Y-You guys… How…did…? Nothing wrong with prey
turning into the predator, right? They totally caught us by surprise… At this rate… Hip hip hooray… Burami! Hip hip hooray,
Muyami! Hip hip hooray, Burami! Is it over…for us? That's…! Hey, he stopped moving… We did it! We beat them! And it's all 'cuz of me! No, Burami. It was our teamwork. It doesn't matter. Let's hurry and finish this. Let's go. It's all 'cuz of me! There's the tower! We did it! You guys! How…?! We fooled you real good! Did you think we were dead?! Too bad…
We're still alive! I used the insects inside me
to mimic a death-like state. Kiba and Hinata switched places
with insect clones. We've been had! Even so? How were you
able to track us?! Didn't you catch their scent? Our scent didn't leak. The reason is… You made airtight suits made
with your insects?! How do you like that?! But, but…we erased our scent too! So how come they were able
to track us?! We didn't follow your scent! I followed this scent! There's a guy named Naruto! Never heard of him.
Who is he?! I'm just saying he exists! And he kept popping
into my head. I thought it was strange…
Then I remembered. Different scents stir up
your memory. Back at that training ground,
some grass got rubbed into my elbow. The scent of that reminded me
of that training… and even brought back memories
I didn't want to remember…like Naruto! Telling me not to give up,
no matter what. That's got nothing to do with us… But it does! The stain on my elbow… I rubbed it on
Blubber Man's belly earlier. You were able to erase
the scent of your flesh… but you didn't think as far as
erasing the smell of the grass. It's your fault. No, it's the entire team's fault! Anyway, we caught up to you,
so return it… No… We'll take it back from you! Our Heaven scroll! Summoning Jutsu! Moguranmaru! Infestation successful! Fang Over Fang! Devour them!
Parasitic Gigantic Beetle! 8 Trigrams: Air Palm! I'll take down all three
of you at once! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Inuzuka Style…
Man Beast Transformation Combo! Three-Headed Wolf! Burami! I'm okay! I'm…! H-Hip… Tail Chasing! Hooray!! Rotating Fang! Kiba! Naruto saved us… That's because… That's because Naruto reminded us
to never give up! You think?! Don't kid yourself! I'm the one
who remembered Naruto, then tracked that guy
with his scent! It was all 'cuz of me! I still think Naruto… It was me! You did great too, Akamaru! It's convenient
having you around, Tenten!

 What do you mean
by "convenient"?

 I have convenient tools,
but I am not a convenient tool…okay?

 No, no! You are absolutely convenient!

 Please!

 – Umm, Tenten?
– Don't follow me!

 I wonder what happened?

 I don't know either.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Tenten's Troubles."


 That was just venting, wasn't it?


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
TENTEN'S TROUBLES


 Tune in again!

 The Imprisoned Pair

 Hey! Hey, come on. Look… I don't think this is
the time to be fighting. Here. Let's call a truce
until we get out of here. What do you say? That's fine… But I don't need charity
from a Great Nation! What? "Charity?" Unsealing Jutsu! If you had water,
you could have just said so. The Great Nations…
don't understand pain. Pain? What are you talking about? Exactly. You don't know pain, or the pain
you inflict upon smaller nations. I have no idea
what you're talking about. But do you understand
that we need to help each other
in order to get out of here? Help each other? I wonder where we are. An ancient ruin
of the Land of Wind. This is probably
some underground structure. You think so too? It looks difficult
to go up that way. I agree. Shall we try? We don't have a choice. How are your teammates? What about them? My teammates aren't suited for
search and rescue… So I'm not going to
depend on them to find me… I plan to get out of here
on my own as well… Oh! Did you find anything? No. I thought this was
the entrance to the ruin, but it's just a boulder. I heard it rains all year long in
Hidden Rain Village, is that true? Yes, it is. I can't even imagine it. Probably not. You've had an attitude
all this time. But you know, you guys
are also to blame for us not knowing much
about the Hidden Rain. We are? Yes. I've heard that secrecy is
a doctrine of the Hidden Rain. So it's no wonder that we don't
know anything about you guys. The only time we
come into contact with you guys is through something like
the Chunin Exams. But because this is a test, instead of talking with each other,
we have to fight. That's true. You guys can come to
Hidden Leaf Village or Hidden Sand Village… but if we were to go to
the Hidden Rain, we wouldn't be allowed to enter. A small nation like the Hidden Rain
must be extremely careful. There are other small nations too… The Hidden Rain is a special case. You're right…
Hidden Rain Village is special. Small nations become embroiled
in the wars of the Great Nations, ending up as their battlefields and are left to suffer
the consequences. But Lord Pain wants to bring
an end to a world like this… He wants the clueless Great Nations
to feel our pain… and bring about true peace. The Hidden Rain
will be reborn anew… The Hidden Rain will be reborn. Does that mean
you'll be more friendly? – That's…
– Wait. Did you hear something? Is it your teammates? I doubt that… I guess not. What is it?! It's an ant. An ant this huge?! It's so hard! They don't call this place
the Demon Desert for nothing… Unreal things live here. I wonder if there are others? I hope not…
But these are ants and… This place is probably
swarming with them. Let's capture one. What? Capture one for what? To tame it and turn it into
a Summoning Animal. A summoning… Besides, their nest could be
connected to other openings. You know how to Summon right? Yes. Is there a trick to it? I wouldn't know. I guess it's just sheer talent… Maybe it's beyond here. I sense a little chakra… It seems like she's moving,
but I can't tell for sure. Found you! This is the 100th time we've met! This time, you're gonna
hand over your scroll to us! One of them is missing. Are they operating separately? Which means it's three against two… and we have the advantage. What's with that beat-up umbrella? What do you think
you can do with that? Planning to run away again?! You won't get away this time! Who are you guys? Let's make this clear. Those guys are our prey. You won't be attacking
these two right now. We're in the midst of
helping each other. Helping? The Hidden Rain? You mean to tell us that
you're Hidden Leaf like us, and you're getting in our way? We're all exam participants. If it comes down to it,
we can come after your scroll too. What?! You want to fight us? Don't underestimate us. After all,
there's only two of you too. What shall we do, Neji? I want to avoid fighting
as much as possible, but we don't have a choice. So you're gonna come at us,
three against two? No. You guys! We'll assist you. W-What's going on with you guys? You're kidding, right? You're gonna team up
with the Hidden Rain to fight fellow
Hidden Leaf Shinobi? According to
the Second Exam's rules, being from the same village
has no bearing whatsoever. If you possess the Earth scroll,
you're fair game. Fair game? Th-That's not fair! If that's the case… Retreat! We'll remember this! We're gonna be Chunin,
no matter what! Why did you help us? To save our teammates,
we need to cooperate. Didn't you come to
the same conclusion? Yeah… Then let's all work together
to save Tenten and your friend. It's the nest… There's no way we can capture one… Look. The ant hole
must lead to the outside. And…you're suggesting
we go right through this? It looks difficult, doesn't it? We should go back
to the original corridor. You're right. Not good! Hurry! Is that an entrance? You're probably right. Okay! Hang in there, Tenten! Hey, Lee! I'm coming! There are ridiculously huge ants! Lee! We're prey to them. I'll distract them. Neji, you guys go in
and find the two. Got it! 8 Trigrams: Air Palm! Hurry! – Right!
– Right! Leaf Hurricane! You're not getting past me! I guess… They wouldn't understand
what I'm saying… They're chasing us. No way… It's caved in… So we can't pass? Byakugan! They're in there. Yeah, that's Ajisai's chakra. Everyone step aside. Stop! An explosion
might trigger a cave in. 8 Trigrams: Open Palm! I suppressed its power
to try to contain it, but I guess it wasn't effective. Not much different
than a Paper Bomb. What'll we do? Hey! What was…that tremor just now? It's from the outside. Someone is trying to
clear this rubble. Your friends? Or yours. I wonder if they can do it. Seems it will be difficult. They're coming! Wait. Summoning Jutsu! Ward them off. What are you going to do? I'm going to suck the sediment
into another dimension with my Transportation Jutsu. But you don't even know
how much sand and gravel there is! This is the only thing left to try. I'll either remove the rubble,
or I'll run out of chakra. Enclosing Jutsu! Please, do it too. Huh?! But I've never
done anything like this… It's similar to stowing away
weapons and tools. You say it's similar but… With Summoning Jutsu, the caster's chakra is
directly proportionate to the quantity and size
of what is summoned. This is the amount of water
you just summoned. By increasing your chakra,
you can summon enough water to fill a bathtub, or a lake,
or even an ocean. An ocean… Come here! This is impossible! Do you remember
the last Chunin Exams? – Yeah.
– Yes. Uh-huh. The last time, the Chunin Exams were cancelled
due to unforeseen circumstances. On top of not being
promoted to chunin, I was useless during the Hidden Leaf's
most critical moment. It couldn't be helped. You were seriously wounded
and unable to take action. I'm ashamed that I was
perfectly healthy, but helpless. Well, that shouldn't
bother you now. After two years, the Chunin Exams
are being held again. Is that true? And so, I must at least ask you… Will the three of you take
the Chunin Exams as a team? That goes without saying. Of course we will! Uh-huh. That's the power of youth! We've grown much stronger
since then! What's the matter, Tenten?
Are you unsure? Sensei, have I gotten
stronger since then? You…should have. But I have nothing to show for it. Without a doubt, you have persevered
and trained since that time. Admittedly, we can't see it as we can Neji's jutsu
or Lee's technique. But do not forget, Tenten. Hard work and effort never betrays. Unsealing Jutsu! Hey! Are you all right?! – The rubble…
– But… it's impossible for me to
remove the rubble like you do. Hurry! The ants will dig right through it. I just have to suck it up
and do it! If hard work and effort
never betrays… Then my chakra has increased! OCEAN
 I almost drowned in the desert. You did it. Yeah. Seawater in the desert! Tenten, you demonstrated
the fruits of your labor. I sure did, didn't I?! As expected! Now then… We had a truce. So what now? If you agree,
can we continue this truce? It's fine with us. After what we went through,
I don't feel like fighting. We're going to head straight
for the finish line. As for us… Yes… We'll detour right
and search for a scroll. Thank you. Huh? I got the knack of it,
all thanks to you. Yeah? I'm glad. Let's both do our best… …and meet up in the Third Exam. Yes. See you again! The other villages
are very curious. Yes… There are so many
different kinds of shinobi. I wonder if Hidden Rain Village
will go through many changes? We will change it… By having faith in Lord Pain
and Lady Angel. – Yeah.
– Yes. Let's go. We have to look for a Jinchuriki. We should've just headed
straight for the goal

 rather than going with
your strategy, Sakura!

 What?! But you agreed to it!

 Ino, you just drank too much water!

 You bloated blister!

 Oh yeah, is that right?

 Well you'd have to drink
a hundred times more than me!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Place Where I Belong"


 If we're talking about getting
bloated from drinking water,


 then you should have no problem!


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
THE PLACE WHERE I BELONG


 Tune in again!

 They're thorns from a poisonous cactus… You're from the Sand… You should be familiar with
the plant life of your homeland. It's pitiful. Kouji… Please get the bandages ready. I know, Ameno. I'm going to extract the poison
directly out of him. Medical Water Style:
Water Mosquito! Are you sure
you don't want it? A Medical Ninja stays
on the frontlines in order to help comrades
stay alive. We're not here to battle. I'm not a Medical Ninja,
so that doesn't include me. What was that? Just joking! I'd never live it down
if word got around that I took a scroll from
an injured comrade. Just hurry and get lost. Would it have been okay
if they weren't comrades? Did you do a sensory check
on the area, Shishio? I could swear this wave pattern is… The Place Where I Belong

 H-Hey, can we slow down a bit? See, Sakura? Choji is worried
about you. He's worried about you, Ino. If you need to rest, just say so. Anyway, I hope you're right. About what? An oasis, what else?! You're the one who said that
even with the scroll, we'd never make it to
the central tower without water! Come on, guys… You're to blame for this
in the first place! That brings back memories
of the last Chunin Exam! All right! Let's find some weaklings! Shut up! That was
a tactical withdrawal! We decided to tread carefully
after we collected the scrolls, and look at the result! We should've just headed
straight for the goal instead of going with
your strategy, Sakura! What?! I've been listening
to you patiently… but you agreed to it! W-Well… At the time, I thought…
it would be easier. You just drank too much water, Ino! You bloated blister! Bloated blister? Is that right? Well, you'd have to drink a hundred times
more than me to fill yours up! If drinking water is all that it takes,
I'd be happy! Now, now, you two.
Get over it. – Shut up, you fa…
– Shut up, you fa… – It's out!
– It's out! Let's get out of here! No way!
Is this trauma? Choji! Mind Transfer… It's faster than it looks… I can't do Mind Transfer.
Then I'll—! Super Expansion Jutsu! Way to go, Choji! Clobber it just like that! We did it! Cha! You know, tell us if you have
a move like that up your sleeve! For an instant, you probably have
more power than me. I-I doubt that… Let me see. Even if we're Medical Ninja, it's hard
to heal your own fist, right? I can't do anymore… My head feels like it's boiling! Yeah… Everyone feels that at first. But once you overcome it,
you will find the true Secret Ninjutsu, the Bond of
the Three Families. Then even Shikamaru
and Choji are…? No way… There's no way those two
are training this hard. The recent incident with Sasuke
wounded everyone badly… in both body and in mind. But because of that,
we will grow. Without a doubt,
it will take several years to master the Secret Ninjutsu,
even if you continue training. However…it's so you can
keep up with them… and in order to protect
the Ino-Shika-Cho tradition, and our clan's tradition… That's why I must pass on
our Secret Ninjutsu to you. That's why I was really happy
when you came and asked me to train you. W-Wait a sec… Did you just say it would take
several years to master it? Hmm? There's no shortcut
to this training. But I believe that you can
see this through… O-Oh right! I just remembered
I have something to do! I'm not finished talking to you! In fact, have you forgotten
the meaning behind the Oath of the Piercings? The oath you took when
your Sarutobi Clan mentor presented those earrings to you? That you will keep that vow, and pass on new piercings
to the next generation. You will eventually lead
the Yamanaka Clan… and entrust a new earring to
your child who will be born. Not this story again… O-Oh, that's right! Choji's being discharged today! What? Choji is? I have to get a present and
get things ready, so I have to go! I-I see. I guess
it can't be helped then. Yeah… See you later. Several years?
You've got to be kidding me! I just wanted to quickly get stronger
and show those guys! What's the point if
it takes so many years? Sakura! Ino! We're celebrating Choji's discharge
from the hospital. Want to join us? Oh… Choji's well enough to leave? That's great news! But I'm sorry! I'm in the middle of training. Please congratulate Choji for me! Huh? Where's Shikamaru? He's seeing off the people
from the Sand. Thank you for the food! Only the three of us here
to celebrate is pretty lame. Hey, Asuma Sensei…
So does that mean I can eat the rest? Hey Choji, I heard all about it! How you were flirting with
all of the nurses! Ino… I'm going to tell you
the one truth about men. There isn't a man alive who
doesn't go crazy over nurses! Right, Asuma Sensei? Hmm? Y-Yeah, I guess… What kind of nonsense is that? Asuma Sensei only has eyes
for Kurenai Sensei! Huh? Is that true? I'd like three more orders
of the special beef filet! Right now! Score! But… Open wide, Sasuke! Thank you, Ino. I owe you my life! That might work… Why am I feeding you?! I never refuse food
that's offered to me. That is my Ninja Way! Another helping please! Right when you were discharged,
you were still skinny. That sure didn't last long. With that kind of appetite,
I'd say you're back to normal. When I'm done eating,
can you help me train, Asuma Sensei? Hey! Are you stupid? You just got better! Man, everyone's so stuck
on training… How come you're so eager
to get back to training, Choji? For starters,
I want to catch up to Shikamaru who beat me in becoming
a chunin. After all, together
we're the Ino-Shika-Cho trio. Do your best too! Okay, Ino? I don't need you to tell me that. MOHAWK FISH MARKET
 All right! Don't get too confident because
of one or two successes. You have to become faster
and more efficient. No one waits for treatment
on the battlefield. Yes! Who's there? Lady Tsunade! Please make me your apprentice! You belong to the Yamanaka Clan… Sakura was able to revive
that in three months. I'll test you…and see how far
you get in three months. I understand. Please let me try! This thing? Usually, the way to resuscitate
a creature that has asphyxiated is to stimulate the heart
or brain with chakra. Octopi generally have one systemic heart
and two branchial hearts. And separate from the brain, they have eight nervous systems
in their arms. It has many organs vital
to resuscitation. In other words, it has a lot of parts that need
to be taken care of. Oh… You can quit if you don't like it! And you, Sakura! You are completely
deficient in the knowledge of healing! I have to learn…all of this?! You can quit if you don't like it! That happens because
your chakra control is too rough. You have to fine-tune
your method, or the octopus would
be ripped apart. Control your chakra more delicately! Y-Yes! She's having a hard time. She's made some mistakes,
but in this short time, she's… – I'll never lose to you!
– I'll never lose to you! MOHAWK FISH MARKET
 It's three months today. Try it, Ino. Yes! You did it! H-Hey, Sakura! You took too long, and made
a lot of pointless errors. While it took me three months too,
I was able to complete it more smoothly. Shut up! You broke my concentration since
you kept peeking over at me! What did you say?! What yourself! You pass! What made you start
learning Medical Ninjutsu? Huh? I wanted to create…
a place where I belong. Naruto… Naruto kept his promise
to me and got beat up. He acted reckless
all because of me… I was always in the back,
following them… But I'm a member of the team too. I wanted to walk
shoulder to shoulder with them. So I promised myself… That from now on, I would. It's so you can keep up with them… …and in order to protect
the Ino-Shika-Cho tradition, and our clan's tradition… That's why I must pass on
our Secret Ninjutsu to you. After all, together
we're the Ino-Shika-Cho trio. Do your best too! Okay, Ino? Team 10 is where I belong. And…I also want to walk
shoulder to shoulder with them. But… Without a doubt, it will take several years to
master the Secret Ninjutsu. Maybe I was running away
and taking the easy way out… Hey, those wounds! Oh, I guess I hurt it earlier. – This is nothing.
– That's not good! Ino... Thanks, Sakura… I'm going back to
the place where I belong… There. That should do it. Choji's Expansion Jutsu…
It's way more than it used to be. The size, power,
and duration of it… He's improved so much from before. Sakura too…
Aside from Medical Ninjutsu, she had that awesome skill
up her sleeve. Both of you have really progressed. I have to try harder too! Yup! Let's aim to pass
the Chunin Exams and do our best! Yeah… Making sure we eat
is important too. Here you go! I never turn down offers of food.
I know that's my Ninja Way, but… What are you talking about? Once you process it, that scorpion's toxin
becomes medicinal! Don't tell me that battle…
was to gather provisions?! It's rich in amino acids and
perfect for healing. Come on, let's eat! Maybe you're the one
who's matured the most. Looks like it's the two women
and the fatso from the Hidden Leaf. The team of Sakura Haruno…
Lady Tsunade's apprentice. That powerful fatso's team? Interesting. Besides that, this team
has two Medical Ninja. Two Medical Ninja on one team? Whatever. Let's get going. Since you don't plan on
ambushing them, right? Found it!

 I sense the three chakra I felt
when we were traveling.

 The enemy is on their way here.

 When did you start being
able to sense things?

 That's amazing!

 Right? I wish I could agree,

 but in actual combat,
it's still difficult for me.

 If I have the time
to concentrate, I can do it.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Yamanaka Clan: Secret Ninjutsu"


 We don't have that kind
of time to spare though…


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
THE YAMANAKA CLAN: SECRET NINJUTSU


 Tune in again!

 We have to reach
the oasis sometime today, or else our provisions
will be in trouble! We have water that I extracted out
of that giant scorpion, so we can still get by! Well, I refuse to "get by"
with scorpion water for the rest of the Chunin Exam! It's just like you planned. I didn't account for this. You are... The Yamanaka Clan:
Secret Ninjutsu

 You are... Please hand over your scroll. Then we will allow you access to
the water in the oasis up ahead. And if you wish, medical treatment. What?!
We don't need to be treated by you! We have our own medical specialist! Ino… Yeah. Besides, no one told us the oasis's
water belonged to anyone. You tell 'em Choji! Sakura, you tell 'em too! We don't need treatment,
but we definitely need water. Hey, we'll lose even before we fight,
if you get weak like that! Ino! Sand Formation: Shisa! Ino! Are you all right? So she was a pawn? Jumping within my range of attack
without taking any precautions… I heard this team had two Medical Ninja
and was curious… But she doesn't have
the cool-headed judgment required of a Medical Ninja. How disappointing that
my expectations were unwarranted. Which means… No more negotiating. Seems that way. You just fired us up! Choji and I will break through this! Medical Water Style!
Water Praying Mantis! Don't worry. Once we get your scroll,
I'll treat your wound. It's not an ordinary Water Style blade. It's as sharp as a Chakra Scalpel. She's very strong! Saganken: Sand Stone Fist! Damn! I missed! Partial Expansion Jutsu! This sand fist…is equal to
my size and power… But… …it's ridiculously hard. And it must be pretty heavy… But he easily… Let's see who's stronger! Amazing… To see through
successive attacks… Damn it… Your attack is boring! He just took a blind swing! You seem to be having a hard time. Not as hard as you. You two…
are fooling around too much. Did you finish infusing chakra? Here I go! Polarized Sand Formation. Burning Sand Camouflage! They disappeared! Choji! This is not the time… to worry about the others. Now, how will you fight
a foe you can't see? Choji… If we scatter,
we'll be at a disadvantage. You got my back? U-Uh-huh! Sakura… Choji… At 8 o'clock, distance 10… At 3 o'clock, distance 5…
Two of them. At 6 o'clock, distance 30. It's no good!
My chakra's disrupted… I can't tell! If my concentration
lapses even a little, my Sensory Perception
doesn't work. I can't use this in actual battle… I'm sorry, Choji. I wanted to get this down
by the Chunin Exams, but… It's okay. The fact that you can even
do Sensory Perception is amazing to me. You can't use it in real battle,
that's for sure. However… It's these little tricks
you think you can't use that somehow work in
an unexpected surprise attack. Not yet... …we can't let it end yet. Nah… Let's finish things up here. Choji, watch out! How do I watch out for
a foe I can't see? Figure it out yourself! In the direction of six o'clock! All right! Thank you, Shikamaru! Found them! The three of them
are on the move. I sense their chakra… The enemy should be
heading this way. Since when do you
have sensory powers? That's amazing! "Right?!"
…is what I want to say, but in actual combat,
it's still difficult for me. If I have the time
to concentrate I can do it. I see… Well, no enemy will give us
the luxury of time… If there's no time to spare,
you just have to steal it! I pretended to be a pawn
to buy time and use Sensory Perception. Don't be so proud of yourself
for fooling us. We thought he got you. Now, now… We're taking this. You can't buy time
for damage this small. What? What the hell is going on?! I never expected a Sensory Perception user
to be among you. That counter attack was
perfectly executed… I'm shocked it didn't work… But the speed with which
she undid the damage… I had kneaded chakra earlier for this Medical Water Style
Water Jellyfish . If it weren't for
this self-healing... We would have been in trouble. Kouji, Shishio… I'm out of Water Jellyfish,
but can you still continue? Sure… This time,
I won't allow any sensing! Choji, Sakura! I'll track them with… Th-This is a sensory barrier?! Blinding Sand Formation: Noise! I won't let you sense us anymore! Ino! Be grateful to Ameno. She gets really upset
if I do too much damage. What? What is it?
You're so antsy. Are you so worried about
your daughter's Chunin Exam? I won't make any excuses, but… my daughter's what you call a jack-of-all-trades
and master of none. Before I knew it, she turned her back on
training in our Secret Jutsu… and took up
Medical Ninjutsu training. I mean… She's been such
a burden to you, Lady Tsunade… Don't worry about it. Besides, I don't intend to
make her a Medical Ninja. Huh? I just thought it would come
in handy someday. Since she skipped out training
for the Secret Jutsu to come learn under me... If I can't sense them, I can't get into
Mind Transfer mode. So I'll contact those two
with Mind Transmission... Sakura, Choji… Can you hear me? I-I hear you. Ino! Can you do something
to sense the enemy?! My Sensory Perception
is being blocked. But…I think the enemy's attack
follows a pattern. That's pretty obvious! The enemy attacks
from your blind side. Like just now,
I can see Choji's opponent. Except, it's already too late
when I see one coming. I knew it… You can communicate with
several people at once. This is
the Mind Transmission Jutsu. Transmission of intel is
a basic part of battle strategy. As long as the enemy
doesn't find out, it's a huge military asset. You learned an awesome jutsu, Ino! I-I guess… The more useful the jutsu,
the riskier it is. That goes for the Mind
Transmission Jutsu as well. If you misjudge your level of skill and carelessly increase
the jutsu's intensity, in the worst case you could die. By increasing the intensity,
do you mean widening the scope or increasing
the number of people involved? I guess that would change
how we strategize… Yes… There are levels within
the Mind Transmission Jutsu that correlates to the user's skill. Transmission speed, the scope, the number of people
in the conversation… These change according
to the user's level. And when truly mastered, you are able to transmit
what is most precious. What is most precious? The Mind Transmission Jutsu… In other words, using your body
to communicate what is in someone's heart. On the battlefield, when you can feel the intensity of
your teammates thoughts for you… that gives you more courage
than anything. I've only scratched
the surface of this jutsu… If only I had spent
more time training… If only I had spent the time
I used training in Medical Ninjutsu, training with Dad… That happens because
your chakra control is too rough. Control your chakra more delicately! Lady Tsunade… Sakura, Choji, listen up! Huh?! You can do that?! It doesn't matter… I have to do it. I have to raise my level
much, much more. Mind Transmission Jutsu! Send Sakura's thoughts to Choji! It worked! Send these thoughts to Choji. I did it! I saw something, but at this rate,
I won't make it in time. Transmitting takes too long. I have to send Sakura's thoughts
straight to Choji. I won't give up! More! More! I will raise the level of
my Mind Transmission! More…more… More…more! My thoughts this time! Cha… How? How could you... Impossible! Intense feelings decided
the outcome of this fight. Ino, are you still up to it? Of course! Then let's finish this. Right. W-Wait! – No excuses!
– No excuses! All right, that should do it. We're in the middle of
the Chunin Exams and we're on opposite sides,
so thank you. I'm a Medical Kunoichi.
This is what we do. Is it any wonder guys
love Medical Kunoichi?! Why are you saying
that nonsense again?! Moe, moe! Well, let's get going. But are you sure about this? Yes. We have our scrolls. Just the water itself is appreciated. But… Talk about complete defeat… Well, we'll get both scrolls and
get our revenge in the Third Exam. Yup. I don't consider this
a victory either. So let's settle it next time we meet. The barrier you put up against
my Sensory Perception was really tough. No, we underestimated your skill. That was our downfall. He's right! When did you learn
to do that anyway?! Huh? Well… What's the saying?
"He who knows, speaks least." I just wanted to prove that
I'm Lady Tsunade's apprentice too. Well said! Anyway, we'll be going this way. And we'll go this way. SENSORY PERCEPTION DIVISION Extreme delicacy is
required to perform the Secret Ninjutsu of
the Yamanaka Clan. I have no doubt that the chakra control
skill required in Medical Ninjutsu will come in handy. Lady Tsunade…! It may seem she's taking a detour,
but she's learning what she must. And you, as her father must
be well aware of that. In time, you will surpass me… In fact, I have faith that
you will become the foremost shinobi
of the Yamanaka Clan! Those guys were pretty formidable. Who knows what would have
happened if you weren't here Ino. Don't say that. You two bought
me time, that's why. If you two didn't give it your all,
who knows…? I'm sorry, Dad, for skipping out
on my training. Please forgive me, Lady Tsunade… For thinking that Medical Ninjutsu
was an easy way out. Your guidance and training
in Medical Ninjutsu helped me to grow. Calm decision-making,
delicate chakra control… Everything is pushing me in
the direction that I'm destined to go. All right, let's do our best
and reach our goal! Okay. What? A doll? An enemy?

 Sakura! How are you doing physically?

 You guys made it possible
for me to rest so I'm okay.

 He's a puppet user!

 Ino, he's coming this way!

 If our enemy is a puppet user,
if we get the jutsu user then we'll...

 Sakura, use my body!

 Leave it to me!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Cursed Puppet"

 This guy's dangerous! IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
THE CURSED PUPPET


 Tune in again!


 The Cursed Puppet

 Hey, we have both scrolls,
so let's go straight for the goal. I wish we could, but there's a high risk of
getting ambushed. We should stick to Sakura's plan
and take the detour. Sakura…? Sakura! Sakura… Two dams… Next, I'm going to teach you
the jutsu to revive all the organs, the entire system. It's called the Ninja Art:
Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu. Ninja Art…
Mitotic Regeneration? This isn't a jutsu that revolves
around healing skills. It's the same kind of
regeneration jutsu that the First Hokage used. The First Hokage had
such enormous chakra that he could activate it
without weaving signs. I don't have
that kind of immense chakra. So…there's one more jutsu
I will teach you. It's called
The 100 Healings Jutsu. The 100 Healings Jutsu? Even I don't have the kind of chakra
that the First Hokage had. So I developed this jutsu. By using it, you can keep
a huge amount of chakra in reserve. By combining these two, the body will continue
to regenerate and you will not die during that time. A-Amazing… However, there's a problem with
The 100 Healings Jutsu. Not only does it require extremely
delicate chakra control, you must amass chakra
for three years. Three years…? You have a constant amount
of chakra infused. Well, you must maintain
that state for three years! 100 HEALINGS I have to maintain this condition
for three years?! Sakura! Due to the effect of
The 100 Healings Jutsu, your normal chakra level
has become extremely low. This will only be a hindrance
during healing and in battle. At this rate, I can't allow you
to perform any surgery or go out into the battlefield. The 100 Healings Jutsu creates
a smaller secondary dam in which to store
the chakra reserve… If I keep two dams of chakra and make sure I use each of them
for their specific purpose… I should be able to perform surgery
as well as fight in battles! Ino! Choji! Is it an enemy? A doll? You're such a good girl… …for finding me some prey. Sakura, are you holding up physically? Yes, since you let me rest… Elder Sister,
let's hurry and kill them. Don't be so hasty, Sana.
You'll get Saya mad. I'm sure Elder Sister wants to
get this over with quickly too. Right, Elder Sister…? All right then… Saya, damn you…! L-Lady Saya! I shall take my time… and curse these victims
that my doll has found. Th-Then which one
will we kill first? Let's see… They are both quite cute… They will be worth killing. I don't want the fatso… Fatso! You're mine! I…am… pleasingly plump! Put it any way you like.
A fatso's still a fatso! This guy's dangerous! Choji! Then I'll take the blonde one. She is mine. Then one with
the big forehead… She is mine as well. Fatso! I said I'm pleasingly plump! Partial Expansion Jutsu! That was close! Choji! She's…a Puppet User! You have been cursed. You can no longer…
escape from her. If she's the Puppet User, as long as we bring down
the jutsu caster… Sakura, my body…! Leave it to me! Mind…! Puppet Imitation Jutsu. Ino…? Ino?! Choji! It's up to me to do this… But… Ino! Sakura! This is not the time to worry
about your friends. You're in quite a bind too, you know. Super Expansion Jutsu! I'll eat you! Ino! W-What is it? Puppet Imitation Jutsu! I realized it after I was
under that jutsu. She calls it a curse,
but it's not a Puppet Jutsu. It's closer to
a Mind Transfer Jutsu. Aw man! The Yamanaka Clan's reputation
is ruined! Elder Sister, thanks for
coming to my rescue! Lady Saya! Curse those guys! – There's no need to tell me that.
– There's no need to tell me that. – I shall show no mercy.
– I shall show no mercy. This doll is mine… Now, go! Punish your arrogant friends! I-Ino, he's coming this way! Then there's only one way.
We have to get the jutsu caster… Ino…? No one beats the Yamanaka Clan
in Mind Transfer! Mind Transfer Jutsu! Choji! Oh? That's not nice. You can't enter my doll
without permission… Get out! Choji is our friend! So you get out! At this rate, I can't allow you
to perform any surgery or go out into the battlefront. I need much…much more chakra… I need much…more chakra… Back then, I was… always being protected by those two… and watching from behind. But times have changed. If I have chakra, I can fight. Isn't that magnificent? I guess you're just about ready. Not yet. I need more power in order
to take down Itachi. Lord Orochimaru! The aforementioned reagent
has just been completed. Oh… The one to test on Suigetsu? Who is overseeing the experiment? I'll have Karin do it. Aren't they both in
the east hideout? Yes, I'm dispatching
a subordinate right away to bring them. I'll go get them. Oh? What brought this on? I'm bored, that's all. Wonders never cease.
I can't believe you're here. Don't worry. I'm leaving the minute
I'm done here. I-I'm not worried! Anyway, you're late bringing
the medicine! I'm so disappointed that
Orochimaru's lackey is you. I sure hope you don't plan on becoming Orochimaru's pet
like this one. Who did you call a pet?! I'm going to get ready
for the experiment. Sasuke, don't bother with this guy! Sasuke, seriously…
Will you help me? I'm sick and tired of this place. That all depends on your strength. Sheesh… Hey… Aw man, what kind of horrible experiment
is it gonna be this time? Hey, you…! You fool, what are you doing?! Lucky me! You let Suigetsu escape…?! When I came to,
everything was like this. Damn it! If Lord Orochimaru finds out
about this, he'll take it out on me! We're going after him now!
Round up everyone! And what good will
that do against him? Sasuke! You're still here?! I figured it might be interesting
to watch the experiment. Anyway, what will you do? Do...? Since I'm here,
I'll lend you a hand. Over that way… Towards 1 o'clock! Sensory Perception? Yeah, if it's someone I know,
I can go after their chakra. That's convenient. But I don't get it. With that kind of power, I'd think you could get away
from Orochimaru. That's because… Help! I'll bet this redhead
is a remnant of a clan from the Hidden Eddies… You were right that
she'd be worth something. Let me go! Let me go! She's a pretty feisty kid. I hear you have an unusual power. We'll get a good price
for you underground. A shinobi without a homeland is quite tragic. No matter where you end up,
you're treated like a outcast. And if you possess attributes
that are unusual, they come after you…
as long as you're living. Well… I speak as
one of the hunted too. But, you know… You must decide for yourself. If you come with me,
no one will ever touch you again. If I have to follow someone… I'd rather it be someone strong. So if I'm stronger than Orochimaru,
you'd follow me? Damn, a river… What a nuisance. Watch out, Sasuke. We may not see him, but he's here. Yeah. I guess I can't fool you. But… I didn't expect you
to be with her. Sasuke follows Lord Orochimaru! What did you expect?! You be quiet. Hey, Sasuke… If you're willing to follow her,
why not come with me instead? Huh?! What're you saying, idiot?! I have no reason to argue with you. Don't ignore me! I already answered that question. Oh yeah… you did say it
all depends on my strength? A Water Clone! Physical attacks don't work on him! Use Lightning Style…! I won't let you weave any signs… Sasuke! I'm so sorry, Sasuke… Just kidding! Hey, that's a nice blade. Well then… You're next… Just obey and return with me. Or you'll regret it. What? Is that a threat? What was that just now? As expected…
It even worked on you. Lord Orochimaru said… that this chain can even bind
a mass of chakra. But I had never used it before. That's enough, Karin. Put that away. Huh? Sasuke… Put it away. In time, I'll get these two
on my side. Their powers will be worth it. Ino's Mind Transfer failed? Not yet…I don't have
enough chakra yet… Choji and Ino are using up
their chakra

 due to all these successive battles.

 Their strength and willpower
are at their limits!

 Back then, all I ever did

 was have Sasuke and Naruto
protect me.

 Now, I should be able
to protect them…

 Like Naruto and Sasuke
did back then!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Their Backs"

 I can't be whining about
my weaknesses here!


 THEIR BACKS



 Tune in again!


 Their Backs

 Not yet... I don't have
enough chakra yet… Wake up, Choji! Choji! What will you do next, my dear puppet? He's not your puppet! He's my friend! What are you doing? Get out of Choji! You're the one who's getting out! I-I won't lose! There's no way the Yamanaka Clan's
Mind Transfer Jutsu will be defeated! Ino?! Sister! Lady Saya! My jutsu… My jutsu was undone! No! It wasn't undone... I didn't lose! I didn't…! There's no way I'd lose! Ino! You did it! Ino! Sakura! A puppet…?! It can't be! Over here! Lady Sana! Mamushi, you're alive? Damned right I am! What about…Elder Sister? Lady Saya! Elder Sister, you're all right! I'm okay… But my doll is broken. I can't believe your jutsu
was defeated…Lady Saya. What?! I did not lose! I didn't! I did not lose! I don't care about
the Chunin Exams anymore. Revenge! We're getting revenge! Lady Saya… But how…? I'm going to turn them
into puppets and make them clean toilets
for ten years…! As expected, Sister! That's so depraved! Those three from
the Hidden Leaf… I'm going to get that
blonde Sensory-type! You know what to do, right, Sana? Of course, Sister. Choji and Ino have used up their chakra
due to all these battles. Their strength and willpower
are at their limits! When the enemy attacks again,
it'll be up to me…! Back then… all I ever did was have
Sasuke and Naruto protect me. Now, I should be able
to protect them. Like Sasuke…
and Naruto did back then! All right, today we're going to
step up our training much more. It will be like an experiment… I don't even know
what might happen. Are you prepared? Y-Yeah! Let's just do it! Good. Come on out, Gerotora! I have a bad feeling about this… Anytime you summon me,
it means you… That's right. I want you to loosen
the Nine-Tails' seal just a little. Well, let me just start off
by saying, I'm opposed to this. The Nine Tails cannot be
controlled by mere humans. That's why I've taken
the time to make sure. With all the training he's put in,
I know that Naruto can maintain his own psyche up to
a two-tail transformation. We need to know
how much farther is possible. Can you handle it, kid? Opening the seal means that the Nine Tails influence
will grow stronger. Can you say for sure that he won't take you over
and run amok? Well, I… Well, if worse comes to worst, I, Jiraiya, one of the Legendary Sannin,
will stop him even if it kills me. Pervy Sage… Besides, I have faith that
Naruto will master this jutsu. As did the Fourth Hokage
who sealed the Nine Tails in Naruto. Yeah! All right then, let's begin. Right! Here we go! Two tails in an instant… Hey, there's the third tail! Now, Naruto! Suppress your chakra now! Suppress yourself! I got that! What is this irritating feeling? It's bitter and hateful… It feels like my insides
are turning black! I'll cooperate with you. Y-You are…? Don't hold back. You want power, don't you? Cut it out! You know it's pretty pathetic… The guy you're trying
to bring back left the village... He forgot
about you long ago… and he's teamed up with
a better partner. Shut up and go back! Idiot… If anyone goes back…
it's you! It was a reckless idea, after all. Such a pity. Gerotora, stay back! I'll stop Naruto. Where am I? You're awake... Pervy Sage! What happened?! Isn't it obvious? You went on a rampage, so I held you down and
this is the result. It's just some broken ribs
and what not… I did that…? It's not your fault.
I made the wrong call. I underestimated some things. Pervy Sage… I… Don't apologize. Sometimes, training goes wrong.
It's normal. But…! He provoked me and I gave in! So? Was Gerotora right? Will you give up because
it's impossible? I held onto my consciousness
up to three tails. But I felt this immense power… And I realized that this jutsu
is absolutely necessary. Even if it's impossible for me now, I'll never give up! I won't betray the faith you and the Fourth Hokage
put into me, Pervy Sage! I always knew it couldn't be
dealt with in a straightforward manner... We just have to
figure out some other way. I know that Naruto is somewhere
training hard right now…! And I…can't waste my time
feeling sorry for myself! Sand Storm Jutsu! Well, Elder Sister…
I leave the rest up to you. We're counting on you, Lady Saya. Cursed Sand Puppet Jutsu! Why did a sand storm
suddenly start up only around us? This is unnatural! We have to consider this
some kind of attack! It's them… Haven't they learned
their lesson? They plan to limit our vision,
then attack! They do have
the ground advantage. Don't worry! I'll send you whatever
images I can grab. Ino! Are you okay? You've been in full Sensory Perception
mode for an awfully long while. I can still handle this… My Cursed Sand Puppet Jutsu… will bring forth many, many more. That blonde Sensory-type
is near exhaustion from using so much chakra
to ward off my jutsu… And now, all these Cursed Puppets… Using Sensory Perception on this
many has to be quite a burden. Mamushi… Roger! Take over, Sana. Yes, Elder Sister. Sand Cloak Jutsu! Ino! Don't push yourself
so hard anymore! But… If each of us can guard
our own line of sight, we'll manage somehow! All right. I'll use Mind Transmission Jutsu
to connect what we each see. That'll take some of
the burden off of me. It's working! Ino! These guys are pretty weak. Yes… This'll work! Keep on coming at me! I'll kick your butts! Choji! Sakura! Ino! It's fine. The poison will start
spreading soon… And you won't be able to move! Choji! Ino! This…is nothing. Yeah! I'll pulverize them all before the poison starts spreading
throughout my body! I'm still the one being protected… I can't let this happen… After all, I changed! I must hurry with my chakra… Like that time… We have to treat him quickly
or he'll die! We must hurry and get Lady Tsunade… Take him to the ICU immediately! Right! I can't allow you to
do any surgery or go out into the battlefront! But… If we wait for Lady Tsunade,
the patient will die… SURGERY IN PROGRESS

I just have to do it! I just have to do it! This is…?! Sakura's feelings are
flooding into me through the Mind Transmission Jutsu…?! There's only me. Just me… This is the time for chakra control… It's no good.
I don't have enough chakra… Sasuke… Naruto… I… I'm still depending on those two…
even at a time like this. No more saying, "I can't." Unless I do it, this man will die. I need more chakra… More… I must do it…
With my own strength… With my own willpower! It's slight, but I feel
my chakra replenishing… I can do it! I will save this man! You're going to take
the Chunin Exams? Are you serious? Please… I already told you I can't authorize it. The dam to reserve chakra
from the 100 Healings Jutsu… and the dam to store chakra
I normally use… I was able to control
both of these dams and successfully performed surgery. I want to see how far I can go. I want to push myself as far as I can
by participating in the Exams. I'm still a novice… yet Choji and Ino asked me
to join them. They asked me to take
the Chunin Exams with them. I want to honor their trust in me! Please! AUTHORIZED Take this with you. Thank you very much! However… Whatever happens at the Chunin Exams
will be your sole responsibility. Understood? Yes! I see… You were under that
kind of pressure, yet you came just for us… We didn't know… and we made you come… You're wrong! I didn't do this for you! I did it for me… Me alone. I've always just looked at Naruto and Sasuke's backs
from behind. I'm challenging myself this time. Ino… Choji… Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for asking me to join you… Thank you so much. Elder Sister, the fatso and
the blonde can't move anymore. Big forehead will soon… Big forehead's chakra
has suddenly spiked! I have enough chakra now! I will protect Choji and Ino,
no matter what! I'll end this… in one sweep! Cha! I didn't lose! I didn't! I did not lose! Elder Sister! We lost… We totally lost! Mamushi! You will clean toilets
for a hundred years! How do you feel? I extracted the poison, so the numbness
should wear off soon. Th-Thanks. No, I owe you two an apology… You saw it through
the Mind Transmission, didn't you? I put you in danger because
of my own motives… You sure did. Kidding… I'm glad we asked you to join us! Ino… Yeah, I'm glad
we asked you to join! I feel like the three of us
can beat anyone. You guys... Thank you! What? Hey, you two! Okay, let's head for
the central tower. We're almost at the finish line
of the Second Exam! Choji, Ino…
Seriously, thank you. Did you just say
a massive sandstorm's appeared?

 It's obstructing
our long-range sensors?

 Who would do this, and why?

 Besides that,
we have to come up

 with safety measures
for the exam participants first.

 We'll lead all the participants
into shelters.

 I leave the Kazekage to you,

 because it seems like he's going to
take matters into his own hands...

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Hidden Plot Set Into Motion"

 Make sure he does not
set foot outside.

Return...Sasuke...to us...! He doesn't belong to you... Don't talk about Sasuke in front
of me, like he belongs to you! Interesting... <i>The Top-Secret Mission Begins


</i> <i>With Chakra alone...</i> <i>With Chakra alone,
<i>he caused this much damage...</i> Sakura! <i>What incredible Chakra...</i> <i>Beyond that, it's going out of control,
<i>like it has a will of its own...</i> <i>But this is
<i>the perfect opportunity...</i> <i>Finally, the top-secret mission starts.</i> Sakura! Answer me! Did she hit her head
when she fell just now? <i>Passing out
<i>at a time like this...!</i> <i>Wood Style Ninjutsu!</i> <i>I can't support it...!</i> Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll! Sai! Sai! Help Sakura... Damn! I see... You borrow
the power of the Jinchuriki... And yet, that's
the best you can do... You're still no match for Sasuke... What is...this place...? Sasuke...? Sasuke! Wait... Wait for me...! <i>Sasuke...</i> <i>Damn it...!</i> <i>I don't have...the power
<i>to bring Sasuke back...</i> <i>That time...back then...
<i>if only I had been stronger...</i> Sasuke!
I won't let Orochimaru take you. I'll stop you even if ... I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs! You can't even put
a scratch on my forehead. That much has not changed. It's hopeless, I tell you... Naruto... you were a special one... but... I am even more special than you! Chidori! Rasengan! - Chidori!
- Rasengan! <i>I am weak, so my words
<i>don't reach him...</i> <i>Because I am weak,
<i>I can't win his recognition...</i> <i>So...whatever happens,

<i>the connection between me...!</i> SEAL This feeling...it's different
from before, isn't it...? Sakura, snap out of it!
Hey, Sakura! Are you all right? Y-Yes... Hey...! Sorry... I'm okay now... What happened here...? Naruto did it... The Jinchuriki... It only stands to reason
that they'd want it too... Where's Naruto now?! On the other side of the bridge...
with Orochimaru. <i>Naruto is a real handful...</i> What's that smoke...? <i>I have a bad feeling about this...</i> Wood Clone Jutsu! I'm counting on you! Right. Wood Style: Doomed Wall! <i>Naruto...!</i> Simply unbelievable, the things this child can do... <i>Oh shoot...</i> Damn it! He unleashed a shock wave
of that magnitude... simply by swinging
one of his arms down. Good grief! Is that Naruto's
Nine-Tailed power? Yes, it is. Please tell me, Captain Yamato. You know something
about Naruto, don't you? Sakura... What on earth
will become of Naruto? He'll be fine.
You don't have to worry. It was for just such times as this
that I was chosen as Team Captain. Next time:
"Orochimaru vs. Jinchuriki" The Hidden Plot Set Into Motion


 My optic nerve is connected. Foo! Wait! Where do you think you're going?! We have both scrolls! So let's head straight
for the central tower! I don't want to! I still haven't made any friends! I just want to have
a little more fun first! Have you already forgotten?! We're taking the Chunin Exams to make
a name for the Hidden Waterfall! We may not beat
the 97-minute record set by the Kazekage
when he was a genin, but we can still shoot
for first place! Yahoo! – She's not listening!
– She's not listening! Calm down. Yeah… Foo, the village chief would
be disappointed if he saw you now! Shibuki...?! Yes, bringing glory
to the Hidden Waterfall is Lord Shibuki's greatest wish! Shibuki… Think of how he would feel! Okay, okay! I guess I have no choice. The lord's wish always
comes first with Foo. I don't know why, but she calmly obeys whenever
his name is mentioned. Foo! Not again! Where are you going?! To the central tower, where else?! – You're going the wrong way!
– You're going the wrong way! With the Sand Eye,
there's no danger to him physically. But as long as Gaara
doesn't change his mind… We can't let down our guard. Gaara… Shall we break for dinner? I agree. It's getting late. No, I'm okay right now. All right. He snubbed us. Sure did. Where are we headed?! We're heading to the central tower. Wait, we don't have two scrolls! Use your head! The earth here is to our advantage! Actually, we don't have
the "Earth" scroll, just the "Heaven" one. That's not what I meant. Any team with both "Heaven" and
"Earth" scrolls will be targeted. So they'll head straight for the central tower
as quickly as possible. But, traps are laid throughout
the surrounding area. Except this eastern route. The eastern route is clear? Then everyone will
be using that route! Except…this place has naturally
occurring hidden quicksand pits. Once you fall in, you can't get out. So we'll get there first, wait patiently,
and then steal a scroll. How's that plan? You're so smart. It sounds a bit cowardly though. Do you want to pass
the Second Exam or not? Don't be a hypocrite. You're right. Let's do it. So you're Houichi. You look quite young. Yes, I am young. But I've studied
the Priest Bunpuku's power to mold currents since I was a child. Bunpuku, you say? Yes. Gaara has become the Kazekage, but he still poses
a threat to this village. As long as he remains, measures are necessary
to control this fear. The Chunin Exams present
the ideal opportunity to extract Shukaku the One Tail. Ultimately, this means
that he must die. Yes. First, we must make sure
the Kazekage is alone, and lure him to the tower. I'll now release the barrier that obstructed long-range
sensory perception. This place is called Demon Desert
because it's difficult to survive its massive sandstorms
once you get stuck in one. That's why
the Sand Investigative Unit uses long-range sensory perception
and stays on guard. What?! What is that? Hey, this is bad! However, if long-range sensory
perception wasn't functioning, what would happen? By now, chaos must be
breaking out at headquarters… A massive sandstorm is forming! Why wasn't it
detected until now?! I didn't sense anything unusual! He's right. I didn't detect
anything either. Could someone be interfering
with our long-range sensory...? Like blocking your perception
with a barrier?! Who would do this, and why? More important, we have to come up
with safety measures for the exam participants first! Isn't survival part of this exam? This sandstorm is way too big! There will be hell to pay
if they all die. Damn it! What a hopeless bunch. The Second Exam will
be postponed temporarily… and we'll lead all
the exam participants into shelters. I leave the Kazekage to you two, because it seems like he's going
to take matters into his own hands... Make sure he does not
set foot outside. – Yes sir!
– Yes sir! Are you ready? – Yes, ma'am!
– Yes, ma'am! Teams One to Three,
come with me. The rest, with me! Let's go! I can't believe we didn't detect
a sandstorm of this magnitude. Who could have interfered? I just hope
nothing bad happens… Yeah. I agree. What is this—?! It is a sandstorm! I know that! So this what a giant sandstorm
of the Demon Desert is like. It's way bigger than I imagined. We can't stay here, that's for sure. This is bad… That's why I insisted on
going straight to the central tower! Watch out! What's wrong? Uh, nothing. A sandstorm huh…? This gives us
the home-court advantage. I really wouldn't say that now... This is bad. We haven't seen a storm
this massive in quite a while. Yeah, I hope the exam participants
are all right. Yeah... Hey, where is Lord Kazekage? He's fine. He's staying put. That's good. Yeah… I can't even see an inch
in front of me! It's just a little sand! The central tower is
right up ahead. Let's overcome this
with gutsiness! Byakugan! This is going to take a lot more
than gutsiness to overcome... Let's look for a spot nearby
to wait out the storm. I can't open my eyes! The sand stings! I-I can't breathe… I can't…hang on… Use this. It's a sand mask! The Second Exam is
temporarily postponed! We'll take you to the shelter. Don't give in to
a sandstorm like this! Wind Scythe! All right, now's your chance
to move forward! Come on, hurry! Are you okay, Lee?! My Hidden Leaf cloak isn't much help
against a sandstorm this bad. All right, then… Eight Trigrams Palm, Rotation! Now, Tenten! Leave it to me! I think I have something that
will help us block the sandstorm! ENDURANCE
 Let's go inside and
sit out this storm. – Okay!
– Yes! I'm amazed you had
something like this handy. Situations like these are
the only times I'm useful. I see! As expected. At least one of you refute me! I can't walk any further… Hang in there!
We're almost at the central tower! Are you sure about that? You've been saying that,
but we haven't reached it yet… I'm sure! Look! The hidden quicksand! See, I was right! This is not time to be saying that! Mikoshi! Hang on! We're going to pull
Mikoshi out of there. Okay! I-I'm sinking! Pretty soon now… Almost there! Now! Grab my hand! I can't stand this! We'd better make it to
the central tower fast or we'll be swallowed up. Shibuki! It's okay!
I will always protect you. Why? Why did you protect me? Because you're precious to me.
Why else? That's why you have to protect
those who are dear to you too. If people bond with each other,
there wouldn't be wars in this world. So first, make a hundred friends. What is it, Foo? The central tower is that way! Hey, are you listening? Lord Shibuki will—! For Lord Shibuki's sake—! I'm sure Shibuki will be pleased
with what I'm going to do now! All right! Stay still! Come on! I am Gaara, the Kazekage of
the Village Hidden in the Sand. I'm Foo from
the Hidden Waterfall Village. Why did you save them? You're taking the Chunin Exams too,
aren't you? Oh... Our village chief, Shibuki,
taught me. Shibuki? Many people might
misunderstand you. But you must hold
the people around you dear… And do your best
for these people. If you do, then someday… I'll have a hundred friends, right? Y-Yes… He taught me that one day
I'm sure to have 100 friends. I see, that's why… As I watched you,
I remembered a certain man… And now, I know why. Who is this man? He's a lot like you. I faced him in battle… And he taught me
that we can learn to understand the pain and sorrow,
and the joy of others. Wow… I'd like to meet someone
like that and become his friend. Hey, what scroll do you guys have? The "Heaven" scroll… Take it! Really?! You're a lifesaver! We can't. We can't accept it. Why not? I have a new goal,
so I don't need it! We were taught by Lord Gaara… To break down the barriers
that we create, to overcome and win,
and grasp the results that we desire. We want that scroll
more than anything, but if we allow you
to give it to us… we can't claim that we fulfilled
the conditions of the Second Exam. We will obtain it through
our own power. I understand! – Foo!
– Foo! It'll be a pain if they catch me… So, I'll be going now! Good bye! – Thank you!
– Thank you! She's interesting… I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere. Lord Gaara… Prepare to die. Lord Gaara, What's going on?

 Their target is me.

 There's no need for you
to get involved.

 It's our duty as Sand shinobi to fight
when our Kazekage is threatened.

 Go! I order you as the Kazekage
to withdraw immediately!

 The Targeted Tailed Beast

 So this is the legendary sandstorm
of the Land of Wind! I'd heard rumors,
but this is mind-blowing! Postponing the Second Exam
was wise. Yes, one careless move
and you're dead. Are you from the Hidden Leaf? We have a letter from Lady Hokage
to Lord Kazekage. It's very urgent. We'll deliver it to him. Our instructions are
to deliver it to him in person. Will you please let us through? No. The Second Exam is under
the Sand's jurisdiction. That's unfortunate. Well, since they won't let us through,
should we return to the Leaf Village? Yeah, I guess we should. That's really bad acting, you two. Well, so long! What?! Don't let them get away! I can't take it anymore! Hang in there! Do you want to rot in the desert?! But… Don't get flustered! I'm Kankuro,
a Hidden Sand proctor. I'm going to get you out of here. You came personally
to rescue us, Sir Kankuro?! Follow me! I'll take to you the shelter. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! I can't walk…any further. Listen to me! Think of this as part of
the Second Exam and get through it! Lady Proctor! If you end up whining
over a mere sandstorm, you'll never make it
as a Sand chunin! Talk about exceeding
one's expectations… I've never seen
a sandstorm this massive. I can barely breathe… Leave it to me! I'll stop it. Third Gate, Gate of Life…Open! All right, follow me! Okay, let's go. Yes. Hey, stop moving around! Sorry! But staying still is so stifling… Instead of getting buried
by the sand like this, maybe we should make
a run for it… Wait… Byakugan! I broke through! The sandstorm should subside
in about an hour. That's when we'll move. I understand. We just have to endure
a little bit more. I have a report on the situation
for Lord Kazekage. You may enter. Excuse me, my lord. We've received status reports
on the sandstorm from the teams. Nearly all exam participants have
been evacuated to the shelter. Lord Kazekage? What is this?! What's wrong?! Are you men blind?! A-A Sand Clone! Where is Lord Kazekage?! Thank you very much! If you thank anyone, it should be Foo of
the Hidden Waterfall… – Y-Yes!
– Y-Yes! Now go! The Second Exam will
probably resume shortly. Y-Yes! What?! An enemy?! Where's it coming from…? We chose the wrong route. We can't see what's happening
on higher ground from here. That sound gives me the creeps. We should high tail it out of here. Yeah, but let's proceed
with caution. Power of Dharma: Silhouette. The tempo's changed.
Let's hurry. Yes. What is this? Huh?! The shadows…! What are these things? Sand Clone! Lord Gaara, what's going on?! Their target is me. There's no need for you
to get involved. It's our duty as Sand Shinobi to fight
when our Kazekage is threatened! Return to the Second Exam. That is your duty as Sand Shinobi! Dharma Sealing Jutsu: Sen no Rikyu! Get down! I'm losing…my power… The chain! Let's pull out the chain! – R-Right!
– R-Right! Go! I can do this alone… But… I order you as the Kazekage
to withdraw immediately! And not a word of this
to anyone, understood? W-What'll we do? How should I know?! Let's go to the central tower
and get help! But…Lord Kazekage swore us
to secrecy! You fool! His life is in danger! Resistance is useless. This is the sealing jutsu passed on
to me by Priest Bunpuku! Now, I can extract Shukaku
from Gaara. Yukata! Are you all right? I-I…can't move anymore. Matsuri! Yukata can't go on! What do we do? Mikoshi, take care of Yukata! I'm going to inform headquarters
about Lord Gaara! But, by yourself?! Watch Yukata! I'm going! Matsuri… I wonder if I'm going to make
a hundred friends...? She is so impulsive! She's abandoning the Chunin Exams?
What is she up to?! Foo… We finally caught up… Where are you going, Foo?! Are you going back
for the Second Exam? I just can't figure her out! – Hey!
– Wait! The friend I just made
is in trouble! Friend? Don't tell me
you're going to help?! Of course! Come back, Foo! Damn it! Never mind
the Second Exam already! We just have to
get her back safely! Y-Yeah… Hey! Let us pass! We have a letter for Lord Kazekage
from Lady Hokage! We'll take it! That won't do! We must deliver it
directly to Lord Kazekage. I explained that's not possible! He's not here! Not here either! Something's up. Yeah… The Kazekage isn't here. What in the world?!
The Kazekage....? This chain… is extracting my chakra… That's...! There's no mistake.
That's Tailed Beast chakra! If left alone, his Tailed Beast
will be extracted…and he'll die! Foo! Stay away!
This has nothing to do with you. It does have something
to do with me! You know about me…don't you? Yes. You're a Jinchuriki too. That's why I can
feel your pain too. And you taught me that friends
understand each other's pain. Stop it…! It's sucking out my power… Are you all right?! So there's another one… How interesting… Not even Lord Bunpuku ever
sealed two Tailed Beasts at once. This is the perfect opportunity to test
the power of the Dharma Seal. Foo! Be careful! Foo! I-I'm sorry… I think I failed… Dharma Sealing Jutsu:
Sen no Rikyu! If the sandstorm continued
any longer, this would have
become our grave. You never know
what will happen next. That's the Demon Desert! Let's get this Second Exam
over with. Right! The central tower
isn't far from here. All right! Let's go! What's the matter? Did you forget something? Yeah… There's something we need to do
before we head for the central tower. Yes. There's someone I want
to settle things with too. Do you have someone
like that too? No, it's nothing like that. Is there something
the matter with them? We have two scrolls. Actually… – What?!
– What?! They're both "Heaven" scrolls. How could you?! Why did you keep something
so important a secret?! I didn't intend to
keep it a secret. It's just that things happened and
I didn't have a chance to tell you. That's a really bad excuse… Well, we'll just have to recoup
and obtain an "Earth" scroll somehow. Byakugan! Over that way! Please wait! Oh, come on! H-Hey! You're going to take
a scroll from someone who's ready to drop
from exhaustion?! We can't do something
so cowardly! Don't jump to conclusions! We can't ignore someone
in distress. That's right! Neji would never stoop
to such a dirty trick. Of course not! The thought
never crossed my mind… Did something happen? It's Lord Kazekage! Someone is attacking Lord Gaara! Gaara?! Just a little longer. No one will come to help us.

 Negative thoughts aren't good!

 No matter how long
we wait,

 reinforcements from
the Sand won't come!

 Again with those
negative thoughts!

 Would you still say that
if you knew

 that the one attacking us
is from the Sand?

 Are you serious?!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Neji's Judgment"

 But I'm sure someone
will come to save us!


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
NEJI'S JUDGMENT


 Tune in again!

 Neji's Judgment


 I'll give this to you,
so please, help me! Don't worry about that! Can you just show us the way? Yes! Over there. Byakugan! Found them! What are you planning to do?! We can't ignore them. But that could mean defaulting
on the Chunin Exams. I-I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
It's my decision to take action. R-Right. You're right, Tenten. This could mean a default
on the Chunin Exams. But in a situation like this,
he wouldn't… Naruto wouldn't hesitate
for a moment to act. Yes, I'm sure he wouldn't. You're right! Naruto would scold us if
we ignored someone in need in order to pass
the Second Exam. Naruto and Gaara both
challenged their destinies and overcame hardship. They wouldn't turn their backs and
say it's someone else's problem. Damn it… I told you not to come. How can I stay away?! If your friend was here,
I'm sure he'd come to save you. Friend?! Yeah, that's because he's a fool… Ninja Art: Cocoon… What is that? This is…? My power. But it isn't enough
to break this chakra chain. So, I'm going to try
to buy us some time. This is…! The flow in the chakra chain
is becoming sluggish… That cocoon has the power to suppress
the absorption of chakra? What did you do? I made a cocoon with
my Chakra Threads. My cocoon is
a complicated tangle of super-fine Chakra Threads. And it weakened its absorption,
just as I thought. It didn't stop it. The rate of chakra being sucked out
has definitely slowed down, and lessened the pain… But eventually, our Tailed Beasts
will be extracted… and we'll die. Negative thoughts aren't good. I'm sure someone will come
to save us! How can you be so positive? Someone once praised me
that I was born special. No one will come to help us. Don't say such things! Hey! Is someone out there?! Your voice won't travel
through this cocoon. Oops! Darn it. All right then… I'll just pull this out
with brute strength. We'll have to wait
to be rescued, after all. No matter how long we wait, no one from the Sand
will come to our aid. Again with those negative thoughts! Would you still say that
if you knew the person attacking us
is from the Sand? Are you serious?! How futile. All you did was throw away
any way of escape. Just how long do you think
you'll last in there? In the past, the only way
I could relate to others was with hate and a desire to kill. Now that I am the Kazekage, some believe that
I will rule through fear, and are trying to eliminate me. That can't be helped. I'm the one who brought it on. If I have any regrets,
it's only that I wish people knew how much I was trying
to change. That friend of yours
taught you, right? That you can share and
understand the pain, suffering and happiness of others! Yes, that's right. But it's difficult for a Jinchuriki. That's not true!
I'm sure it'll all work out. Even a Jinchuriki can make
a hundred friends. I just know it!
The Village Chief told me so. They're alike, after all. Judging by the panic within
the Hidden Sand, we can assume they don't have
Gaara under their protection. Yes. This is just as we feared. He set himself up
as bait to lure out the faction planning
the coup d'état. In the worst case, it's possible
he's already been assassinated. The Leaf has close ties to him. If something like that happens, it would greatly affect
our future relationship. We can't allow him
to be assassinated. As long as we don't know
who the coup d'état faction is, we can't go to the Sand
to request assistance. We'll just have
to do something ourselves. That being said,
we don't know where he went. We have no clues at all. What's that? Ah, they're genin
of the Hidden Sand! The sound of a lute?! What is that?! It looks like a giant cocoon! And who is that man? You're exam participants
from the Hidden Waterfall! Yes… We're looking for Foo.
She wandered off. Foo wandered off? What?! Chakra is being extracted
from Gaara and Foo. What's wrong, Neji?! What is in that cocoon?! Two Jinchuriki. One of them is Lord Gaara… But who's the other one? From the Hidden Waterfall… It's your teammate. Are you fine with this happening?
At this rate, they'll both die. It's probably the Sealing Jutsu
of that lute-playing priest. He's extracting Tailed Beast Chakra, and ultimately,
the Beasts themselves. If the Tailed Beast is extracted,
Lord Gaara will die! Please help him! And what do you intend to do? Are you going to abandon
your teammate? Let's call a truce,
and fight together! If we act now, we can save them… Please… Save Foo. All right. I see! From what I gather,
the priest's back is vulnerable. This is what I've come up with. We'll divide into two teams… An attack and a rescue team. The attack team will sneak in close
and attack from behind… The rescue team will seize
the opportunity and rescue the two. Lee, Matsuri and the two
from the Hidden Waterfall will attack the lute-playing priest! – Understood.
– Understood. Right! We'll pulverize him! I'd like to be on the rescue team! No, I need Tenten for the rescue. The two of us will go. Okay! Scatter! Shuriken Shadow Clone! Water Style: Water Shuriken! Deadly Shell Meteorite! Leaf Hurricane! Dharma Barrier:
Celestial Pillars! What is that?! Some defensive jutsu?! No, that's not the only thing. Let's use caution! Tenten, I need a Chakra Sword. Got it! SWORD
 Aim for a section of the cocoon! Right here! Damn it! We can't get close to him! It's an impregnable barrier! At this rate, we're not helping
Lord Kazekage at all. No, this is sufficient. What? Just drawing his attention away
will make Neji's job easier. That is what we are here to do. Neji, are you all right?! Are you two okay? See! Someone came to help, after all! I gave strict orders
not to tell anyone… Don't be angry with
your subordinates. They were worried sick about you. I figured as much… This chain has penetrated
your Chakra Points. And they are causing direct damage
to the Chakra Network. They're controlling
the flow of chakra through the Chakra Points and siphoning away
your Tailed Beast Chakra. Yeah… Eventually, the Tailed Beast Chakra
will be weakened enough and he'll extract the Beast itself. Can you please help? Tailed Beast or whatever,
chakra is chakra. If we plug the Chakra Point that's being
used to siphon the Tailed Beast Chakra, we may be able to stop the flow. Is that possible? Yeah… It'll be tricky,
but it's worth a try. Please do. Here it is! Gentle Fist: Chakra Point Needle! What happened? The Tailed Beast Chakra is
so powerful that it repelled me. I didn't think it would
be this strong! That time… The force of the Nine Tails Chakra
inside Naruto was unbelievable… So I guess Gaara and
Foo's Tailed Beast Chakra are just as powerful as Naruto's. Please don't give up!
We're counting on you! Yeah, I know. I'll try again! All right, the flow stopped! You're next, Foo! Okay! What?! The chakra flow has stopped?! Why?! Why isn't the Tailed Beast
Chakra flowing in?! The lute-playing priest
is acting strange… Yes, something must
have happened. Did the Leaf's Byakugan user
do something? Well, the enemy definitely
looks flustered. What's happening? It looks like it's alive! That's creepy! Be careful! Unless I do something, the chain will continue searching
for Tailed Beast Chakra! It will find the chakra that
it has already stored up in me… and start siphoning
that Tailed Beast Chakra… until it destroys itself. The barrier's been broken! May I ask you, not to kill him? Yes, I understand. Neji… I see… It's the same theory as earlier. The Chakra Points are closed. There are more Chakra Points
here though… Everyone, please stand back! We can still save him. Let's take him to the Medical Team. Yes, understood! You have my thanks, Neji. Imagine, being rescued by you. Is everyone all right?! Yes, we're okay now. Lord Gaara! Thank goodness you're safe! Matsuri performed admirably too. Over there! It seems like they don't need
our help, after all! Yes, I guess we were
a little too late. I'm Foo of the Hidden Waterfall! I'm trying to make
one hundred friends! So please, be Foo's friend! O-Okay, okay! I get it, just let go of my hand. Neji! You're so lucky! Woohoo! Woohoo! Friends! Friends! There was a time I felt the wounds

 that I inflicted on my people
would never heal.

 I thought I should just disappear
from the Sand Village.

 But I found there were people who,

 without any prejudice,
accepted my feelings.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hopes Entrusted to the Future."

 It is a youthful power,
one that supports the future.


 IN NARUTO'S FOOTSTEPS ~
THE PATH TRAVELED
HOPES ENTRUSTED TO THE FUTURE



 Tune in again!


 Hopes Entrusted to the Future He's not on the north route. He isn't on the south or
west routes either! Where could Lord Gaara
have gone? The massive sandstorm
seems to have passed. Lord Gaara?! What's the big commotion? Stop making a fuss and
resume the Second Exam. Yes, sir! Hurry! Prepare to resume
the Second Exam! It's unusual for Houichi
not to send a message. Did he fail? Lord Gaara! Fugi… I've wanted to have
an in-depth discussion with you. Well then… What did you want to talk about? I've always thought of you as
a valuable citizen of the Hidden Sand. Of course, I still do. I am humbled. In the past, words like "citizen"
and "friend" were just that… Mere words that held
no meaning to me. For a long time after I was born,
even though I recognized these words, they were not part
of my existence. Oh. And when did these concepts
become real to you? When I infiltrated
the Hidden Leaf Village with the intent to destroy it. There, for the first time,
I met someone I could call a friend. Ironically, he was an enemy
who belonged to the Hidden Leaf. Although he and I
shared similar circumstances, he empathized with the pain of others,
and shared in their joy and tears… Meeting him made me realize… how precious and important
the word "friend" is. And it made me want
to become like him… a human being who is valued
and needed by others. Lord Gaara, you are and
will always be, a person who is essential
to the Hidden Sand. All this time, I've been considered
a military weapon to be feared. And that continues to instill fear even
in the hearts of the Hidden Sand. But that's—! I know. If this were not so, my own father would not
have tried to kill me six times. I am aware of the deeply rooted opposition
to my tenure as the Kazekage. Should I accept position
or should I turn it down? It was a dilemma for me. But after my friend, the Leaf Shinobi,
taught me about friendship, I thought it over and decided… that I wanted to heal the pain
I had caused everyone. But it's been difficult to
get the people of the Sand to believe that I am sincere. There was a time I felt the wounds
that I inflicted on my people would never heal. I thought I should just disappear
from the Sand Village, then the fear would
finally disappear too. But I found there were people who,
without any prejudice, accepted my feelings. You are frightened of yourself. When you handle a weapon, you must suppress your feelings
and become emotionless. Y-Yes, sir! I once met someone just like you
in Hidden Leaf Village. Through sheer perseverance,
he has become a fine shinobi. Shira, I predict you will be
as good a shinobi as him. These shinobi have to come to accept
and rely on my guidance, and are maturing steadily. We're almost there. But we still need one more scroll. Well, a lot of things happened. Let's forget about passing
the Chunin Exams until the next time. In that case, I don't know
if we'll get a scroll, but there's someone
I want to fight just once. That person received guidance
from Lord Gaara and developed into a shinobi,
just like me. There's something
I want to confirm by fighting someone who received
the same teachings as me... We did it! We made it! We made it! But we still only have
the "Heaven" scroll… It can't be helped. We're physically at
the end of our limits! If I hadn't stopped along
the way for a personal battle… Don't say that! That's right.
This is all we can do right now. I'm sure we'll get
another crack at it. Thank you! What is it? Shira, please fight me. If I lose, you can have this. It's senseless for Sand
to fight Sand. We've already made a decision. Hey! This is useless to us! Take it! Really? You're a lifesaver! We can't accept it. What? Truth be told,
we don't want the scroll. I just want to use this opportunity
to fight you, Shira. Fight me? You and I both… have been taught
by Lord Gaara. We are the ones who will carry out
Lord Gaara the Kazakage's will… and support
the Hidden Sand Village. I want to make sure
we deserve that right. Fine. I accept your challenge. Is this okay? If that's what you wish, Shira. Y-Yeah… Thank you, Shira. Who are they? The promising youthful power that
will sustain the future of the Sand… I believe in them and
have high hopes for them. Those who wish to hunt me
are free to do so… However, do not involve those youths. I don't want them colored with
hatred and vengeance. Come on, Matsuri! Right! There were times when
I doubted myself as the Kazekage. But after coming into contact
with them, I realized that perhaps even
someone like me can accomplish things. I want to erase hatred
from Hidden Sand Village, and create bonds with people
I can call friends… Friends who understand and
share each other's pain. If you object, then take my head. But leave them out of this. Come on. Thank you very much. Please take this. – Huh?!
– Huh?! This won't work… Lord Gaara has matured indeed. Perhaps we old soldiers
worried needlessly. We must let the horrible
memories of the past fade into the darkness... And leave it to the next generation
to build a new future. I alone was responsible
for all of this. Please accept these. Two "Heaven" scrolls
are not acceptable! Oh, but that's—! No, no, no! I can't reveals any details, but there were
extraordinary circumstances that prevented us
from collecting scrolls! Please ask Lord Kazekage! It doesn't matter what circumstances
there were. No means no! You are stingy! – Now, now…
– Just give it up. No…! I can't just give up! Cancel the Third Exam? I'm sorry. I can't go into details, but this is a domestic matter
within the Sand. Then how do we determine
who passed the Chunin Exams? We've prepared detailed reports about each team's performance
in the Second Exam. I'd like the respective villages
to use them to decide whether their participants
should be promoted to chunin. Well, these exams were meant
to test their ability to carry out missions as chunin… It can't be helped if
things turned out like this. But the participants put their lives
on the line to cross the Demon Desert… Will they be satisfied with this? I understand that. Looks like the Third Exam
is cancelled. What happens to
the Chunin Exams then? I did have a bad feeling
about this… Does that mean all that effort
was for nothing?! We continued to the very end and
didn't give up, so we should be okay. Those who dropped out midway
are the ones who should be worried. I sort of feel sorry for them. All we gained was hunger
and exhaustion. That's no gain! At the very least,
perhaps we gained self-confidence. Exam participants!
I commend your hard efforts! With the passage of time, our shinobi world needs
a new system with new laws. Until today, we shinobi were
required to sacrifice even the lives of our comrades
for the sake of our laws and rules. But I have realized that we have
something even more precious than rules and regulations. That is friendship,
with our fellow villagers, our fellow shinobi, and the bond we share with others
who understand the same pain… I believe that each of you who stands here now
knows exactly what I mean. Therefore, I deem
the Third Exam unnecessary… Furthermore, I am rescinding part of
the requirements for the Second Exam. So what does that mean? For each of you standing
here right now, a detailed report of your performance
will be sent to your respective villages. Your Kage will make the final decision
on your promotion. That means we have
to wait longer? But it also means we still
have a chance, correct? When you reach
the northern border, be careful. Thank you. Yome, since you're going up
there too, try to be nice! Huh?! What? Huh?! We got assigned to
the same place by chance, that's all! Yeah, sure! Go for it! Yome, let's go! Hey, wait up! I hope they're going to be okay! We've gone through the report
from the Hidden Sand, and your Chunin promotion
has been approved. Thank you. And I'm going to assign you
to an S-rank mission right away. Today's corpse is really light. I can tell by experience…
this one is a woman. The highest tower in the village where
we always deliver these bodies… You know what that's for? In our village, isn't it usually where
the ashes are enshrined? It was originally built as
a memorial to honor the dead. NO TRESPASSING

If that's the case, why is it off-limits to
even relatives of the dead? Like I know... Rumor has it that Lord Pain
is up there. Huh? That's ridiculous… It can't be true. Rumor… It's just a rumor. Anyway, I'm going to check it out... Just like you said, it's a woman. It's Ajisai the chunin. She just passed the exams recently. Her very first mission after becoming
a chunin…ended like this? Thank you very much. Oh…Lady Angel! Bring the next one, quickly. Yourou! I know… We're being followed. Fuu… Let's go to that rocky area for now. What? How boring. We don't know who you are… But we've been on to you
for a while now. I told him to stop… since not being able to kill you
is such a pain in the butt. Say, mister! Aren't you a former
Hidden Waterfall? What? I know you! After your failed Hokage
assassination attempt, you stole the hearts of
the village elders and escaped… You're Kakuzu! Kakuzu?! Impossible! How old does
that make him?! I always thought if
I got to meet you, I'd like to be your friend! Kakuzu… Is she stupid? I wouldn't know. I deserted the village
a long time ago. How about we start out as
casual acquaintances over tea? I didn't come here today
to become your friend… Well, that's too bad… I've gone over
your Second Exam reports. And…Hinata, Shino, Kiba,
Choji, Ino and Sakura… You six passed with flying colors
and are promoted to chunin! After all, we didn't have
the second scroll… Komugi, Gennai, Inaho… You will be given another chance
next time. Finally…although they did not
collect two scrolls, they performed admirably… and are more than qualified
for promotion. Lee and Tenten,
you are now chunin. Lady Tsunade! Team Guy is one for all, all for one!
How can Neji not be included…?! Just let me finish! Neji Hyuga is given a special
double promotion to jonin! The Kazekage himself noted, "In particular, Neji's performance
was most impressive and" "due consideration has
been given in this report." He's already proven himself to be
more than capable as a chunin. Way to go, Neji! Congratulations! Thank you very much! Thank you to you both. I made it to chunin because
of Team Guy's teamwork. Our three-man squad is forever, right? Yes, I hope so. I finally overtook Naruto! He's going to be so mad that
he missed the Chunin Exams. I wonder what kind of training
Naruto is doing now… It will soon be time to
wrap up training and return to Hidden Leaf Village. Ouch! That chest wound still hurts, right? Pervy Sage, you just rest up! I'm gonna continue my training! Hang in there, Naruto!

 What's going on?! My Medical Ninjutsu
isn't working on him!

 It's probably because Nine Tails
has been extracted out of him!

 But there's a way to save him!

 That's why we're hurrying!

 There's someone else where Sasuke is.

 Do you recognize the chakra?

 No, but it has
a real nasty feel to it.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"On the Brink of Death"

 Is this the end of the line for him?

 ON THE BRINK OF DEATH

 Tune in again!

 Good… Naruto! Stop, Madara! I already told you
that you had little time left. Obito… He's reluctant to give up
the Rinnegan to Madara… You stubborn fool…
You're almost dead anyway! Hang in there! Don't give up! You're strong! You'll pull through! My chakra's almost all… Sasuke's not good, he's really gonna… At this rate, Naruto's going to… – die!
– die! On the Brink of Death

 The Nine Tails' chakra… No heartbeat or pulse... No way! Hang in there, Naruto! What's going on?! My Medical Ninjutsu isn't
working on him! It's probably because the Nine Tails
has been extracted from him! That's impossible! Madara got him. But there's a way to save him! That's why we're hurrying! To where?! To where the Fourth Hokage is. Hey, kid! Kazekage! Do me a favor! His father… One-half of me is sealed inside
the Fourth Hokage, Minato. So transplant that other half
into Naruto. That will save him. Hurry to the Fourth Hokage! He has the Teleportation Jutsu. Can't we just contact him over there
somehow and have him come here? That won't work! His Teleportation Jutsu is written
into my Sealing Formula. Once I'm extracted,
it will disappear… Just rush Naruto over
to the Fourth Hokage. Got that, Gaara?! Kid Kazekage…
I'm counting on you! That's what Nine Tails told me. Right now, there's no other way
to save Naruto! How much longer 'til
we get there? Several kilometers! I'll do whatever it takes
with what little chakra I have left! All right! As long as I'm here,
I am not going to let you die! I'm going to go at full speed! Right! If I could just…save his soul
with my Forbidden Jutsu… I can't sense any chakra
in him anymore. I can't even move my body…
let alone use Teleportation. Damn you, Madara! Karin just went charging ahead! Let's go back up Karin! Shouldn't we wait for an opening,
or have some sort of plan? Whoa, you're not getting past me. No one's answered my question yet. Don't get in my way! I'm going to Sasuke! Move, you bastard! You've got to be kidding!
Karin is amazing. What is this?! The same power as
Kushina Uzumaki's. After all this time,
she's finally attained it… Oh no… You just broke my little toy! Do not…underestimate me! Double Blast! Not bad. I can't move… A Curse Mark! Too bad! A-Amazing… Orochimaru…They got past it! It's no big deal. It's too late even if
you go over there anyway. But as for you guys… I'm going to take you down. Stop your ogling! We must go too. Still…who is he? Are you all right, Karin? Yeah… But never mind me. Sasuke! I can't sense Sasuke! So this is Six Paths power… Now, for that left eye. I'm a super elite ninja who's gonna
be the Hokage someday… Remember my name…
Naruto Uzumaki! I'm gonna become the Hokage! The Hokage that surpasses all
previous Hokage, ya know! That silly dream you once had… no longer seems silly. I will not let you die! You're not going to die,
no matter what! Your dream…
is right before your eyes now! Who's there?! Depending on the situation, Orochimaru might try
to steal Sasuke's body. It's what Kimimaro had wanted,
but I doubt Karin would allow it. There's someone else
where Sasuke is. Do you recognize the chakra? No! But… But what? This chakra…
has a real nasty feel to it! Then we need to hurry even more. We don't know what this stranger
might do to Sasuke. Is this the end for him? Damn it… Yikes! Karin! If you up the pace too much,
you're going to collapse soon. Let's head to the others
with youth power to the max! Lee! Tenten! Yes, sir! But you're falling over,
Guy Sensei! Your body isn't keeping up
with your spirit! That's Gaara's sand… I think I saw Sakura too… Why are they retreating? Kakashi hasn't overtaken
and passed us yet, has he? No. The Nine Tails' chakra we got
from Naruto has disappeared. And Sakura, a Medical Ninja,
is on the move… I have a feeling something
is going down on Kakashi's side. We're heading back, Lee! Tenten! My red-hot blood is boiling! It must be a super premonition! Nothing good can come out of
being stuck with this hot-blooded, airhead duo! Neji, why did you leave me? Okay, let's head back. You want to go back, right?
Fine, let's do that. Neji… I'm never going to forgive you. Wait for me! I'll be there
as fast as I can, Kakashi. Hurry, Kakashi…the left eye. Obito's conscience is clear.
Now's our chance. The problem is how to tear
Obito away from that guy. And we can't hand over
that left eye to the enemy… I feel a little heavy. There's something catching
in my chest. The Sage of
Six Paths' Ninja Tools, eh? Useless. But now I'm lighter. What will we accomplish
by returning now? Tenten, don't grumble! I just have this gut feeling that
some unknown horror is approaching. Yes, sir. Are you two all right?! Yes…! No way… These are definitely the—! You guys are stubborn too! Obito's consciousness is
no longer stable. Let's go, Kakashi. Hold on, Minato! Switch your chakra to Sensory Mode! No way! We were distracted by
what was happening here. There's no mistake. My other half has
already been extracted! Sensei? Kakashi Sensei! What happened? The Nine Tails was extracted
from Naruto! At this rate he'll—! Naruto… Fourth Hokage, I bring a message
from Naruto's Nine Tails! He said to transplant
the other half of Nine Tails that you have within you,
into Naruto! That will save him! Oh… Kakashi, he's yours. I understand. I'll help! I'm going. Be careful. Of course! I'm not dying
until I see my child's face. Once this baby is born… I'll have two things
to worry about. Don't worry! I'll protect the kid! No matter what happens,
and no matter what it takes! But you're busy being Hokage, and I get the feeling he's going to
be mischievous and unreasonable and say he wants to be the Hokage… – He'll be clueless about girls…
– Hey, wait! – And he'll defy his teachers! And…
– Hold on! The child's not even born yet…
You're worrying too much! Besides, how do you
know it's a boy? Or that he'll want to be
the Hokage even before it's born? Because… I'm his mother. In any case, I'm the Hokage. And I'm not going to die easily. And no matter what happens to me, I, the Hokage,
will protect the child. Don't worry! You're quite confident when
it comes to this baby! Well, of course… I'm his father. The current me can… This time for sure! What? That's—! Nine Tails… You're finally mine! What happened?! How's Naruto?! What was that? No way… Lord Madara… You're late, Black Zetsu… I decided to come to you! Madara, I need to
ask you something.

 What am I to you?

 You're kidding, right?

 What kind of stupid question is that,
to ask at this point in time?

 You are only one thing to me.

 You are he who rejects this world,

 who holds that thought in his heart
and strives toward a goal.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Two Mangekyo"


 Yes, you are…


 THE TWO MANGEKYO


 Tune in again!

 The Two Mangekyo
 
 Zetsu… How long are you going
to cling to Obito? Sorry… But that allowed me to steal Nine Tails'
other half from these guys. Good. Now bring it,
and my left eye, to me. I sense Sage Power… And it's much stronger than
what Obito possessed. So the Fourth Hokage's Nine Tails
is inside that black thing! Madara?! How did he get Six Paths' power? Since Lord Madara is here,
you can't do anything to me… even if I separate myself
from Obito. Now, Kakashi! Why you—! You're still—! Not yet… I need to
ask you something, Madara. We need the Nine Tails inside
that thing for Naruto. We cannot afford to miss. We have to wait for
the right moment. Just what am I…to you? You're kidding, right? What kind of a stupid question is that,
at this point in time? You are only one thing to me… You are Madara. Now go… Until the time when
I am revived… You shall be Madara Uchiha. Madara is he who rejects the world. All who hold that in their heart… and strive toward achieving
the Infinite Tsukuyomi are Madara. That… That was once my path too. I left you in charge of everything… And let you walk in my shoes,
while I slept, waiting to return. It's the path I guided you towards. You were supposed to live out
your life as Madara in order to achieve our goal. As the savior who rescued this world. This world laid out by
the Sage of the Six Paths… has failed. Now listen… The chakra dispersed by
the Six Paths was originally… meant to be a linking power. The mental energies of people
would connect and feelings would be understood without
the need for words… That would lead to peace and stability. NINSHU

The one who preached this
as Ninshu, the Ninja Creed and sought to guide the people,
was the Sage of the Six Paths. However… But before long, people used chakra
not to connect with others but only to link the mental and
physical energies within themselves. Through a method of infusing one's
own chakra and increasing it multifold… they changed chakra into ninjutsu
that could be used as weapons in battle. Ironically reverting to the way
Six Paths' mother, Kaguya, had originally used chakra. Just what the hell is
he talking about?! Gaara… I know. All the Sage of the Six Paths did was
to further the human paradox. And even if bonds were established… All they learned was that
true understanding was not possible. In any case, chakra only gives rise
to conflict and false hope. We all know the reality all too well… Even as we seek peace,
we seek war. And this reality compels
infinite suffering through the power known as chakra. Power leads to the desire for war. And the lack of power leads
to losing everything. I will build a new world
that overcomes that! Through the Infinite Tsukuyomi, I will create a dream world
without any abominable chakra! I, who possess the most
powerful chakra, shall lead it! And you are not Obito,
but me…Madara himself. Obito Uchiha with his Uchiha Chakra,
challenged Kakashi Hatake, desired the title of Hokage,
and yearned for Rin Nohara! But because his power was false,
he ended up losing everything! This is hell! Have you forgotten?! Come over here. Yes, come, Madara! From this day forth,
you are a savior. You are still the savior, even now. Sand Wave! Kamui! Sage Jutsu! Rasengan! No way… Their combined attack… Now… You damned… What are you doing?! No… What I'm doing is no different
than a Hokage's actions. In fact, it's greater. Because I can truly
bring about peace. There's no need to voluntarily
walk down a path you know to be dangerous. You'll have to step over
the corpses of your friends. It's the path I guided you to. I don't want to know the easy path. I left you in charge of everything… And let you walk in my shoes… The Hokage is the one who
walks ahead of everyone else, who endures the pain. One who leads others… is one who never steps
over his friends' corpses… even if his own ends up
being stepped on. Then in order to confirm that,
you'll have to become a corpse. You won't be
stepping on me anymore. I realize now that letting someone
handle everything in your name isn't the same as truly
entrusting them with the task. I am not you. Go for it, Obito! Become the Hokage
and save the world! That's a promise too! The current me… is the one who wanted
to be Hokage…Obito Uchiha! Obito… Obito…You've finally found yourself! I passed through you. That's your original right eye's power. Are you trying to weaken me
by taking away the Tailed Beasts? Do you think you can
challenge me and win?! So weak… Is that all? You only tore off
a mere sliver of the One and Eight Tails? Kakashi! Take Naruto into the Time-Space! Obito plans to hand him
the Nine Tails there! Kamui! Kamui! I know that when you teleport
your body materializes… If I try to teleport carelessly,
he'll come after me. My teleportation speed is too slow. Since he'd been in Sage mode once, he was able to steal some
Sage Power from me too… Madara… could have killed me at any time… I was so scared I forgot to breathe! Of all the people,
he's in a different class! All right, I transported Naruto. All that's left is for you
to teleport yourself there and Naruto will be saved, right, Obito? Damn it. You always talk down to me… And act so superior…
Just like old times. Obito! Rin is here to pick you up. Sorry, sorry, Rin! I can't wait to see
my great-grandchild's face, Obito. Grandma, I'm only five years old. Come on, hurry,
it's going to start! YOUTH NINJUTSU COMPETITION
 Wow! This is the kunai prize! It's so cool! Okay, thank you very much! I wonder what kind of
ninjutsu is next? If these are the opponents,
this is going to be a piece of cake. Number seven, Obito Uchiha! That's me! Go for it, Obito! What are you going
to show us, Obito? I'm going to be doing
the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Wow, impressive! All right, let's get right to it! Here I go! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Six points! Seven points!
Seven points! These are great numbers! Obito Uchiha is in
the lead right now! That was great, Obito! I wasn't in top form today,
but I think it's a sure win for me. All right, here's our final challenger! Kakashi Hatake! What are you doing to do
for us, Kakashi? Well, how about
the Earth Style: Mud Wave? Really? That jutsu requires
a considerable amount of chakra. Are you sure about this? Mud Wave? At our age? Earth Style! Mud Wave Jutsu! The judges all agree!
Perfect 10s! The winner is Kakashi Hatake! Too bad, Obito. Kakashi…Hatake! You're late, Obito! Everyone's been waiting! Sorry, sorry! On the way,
an old man was… Kakashi! Kakashi's joining us from today! Let's play kick-the-can today! Sure! Let's play! Kakashi's the only one left. Obito's such a fast runner. Save us, Kakashi! I'll catch him instantly! What—?! Saving my friends, no matter what… That's my Ninja Way. Want me to be "it"? As if! Obito was "it" the whole time. But he couldn't catch Kakashi,
not even once… Kakashi is amazing. Oh, Mom! Obito, I have to leave. Me too! Mom! I won again. But I'll praise you for one thing… You're the only one until now
who never chickened out. You show off! Hey, I was praising you. There's my dad! So long! Yeah… See you! Say, Grandma… Am I like my dad? Or my mom? Well, let's see…
I think both of them. You are alive because
of your parents. So you must honor them both
and work for the sake of others. Oh man, oh man, oh man!
This is the one day I can't be late! ENTRANCE CEREMONY
 It's the entrance ceremony
and you're already late. Someone like you has no business
being in the Academy. You'll never make it. It's okay. I got this for you. For me? Yes! Just submit this and
you'll be able to enroll. Thank you! You're a lifesaver! Keep pampering him and
he'll never be cured of his tardiness. Shut up! Do you wanna fight? Say that again! – What?
– It's your fault! What did you say,
stupid Kakashi? Kakashi Hatake! I'll take him down and become
the Hokage, no matter what! That's the spirit! Kakashi is different from us, isn't he? What a dummy! He challenged Kakashi again
and got his butt kicked. As if the class loser can beat
the head of the class! Rin?! Someday, I'll awaken my Sharingan, and I won't lose to him… Kakashi hasn't been coming
to class at all lately. I heard something unfortunate
happened to his father. I think it's a difficult time
for him right now… After that, you skipped a grade
and quickly left the Academy. Back then, if I had noticed
the huge emptiness in your heart… maybe our present destiny
might have been a little different. I didn't realize how much the death of your father Sakumo
had changed you… Hey Rin, have you seen Kakashi lately?

 Why do you ask?

 I heard a rumor about him yesterday.

 It wasn't good,
but he seemed different.

 Could it be…?

 Do you know something?

 Well, no…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Formation of Team Minato"

 Well, see you tomorrow, Obito!
 
 THE FORMATION OF TEAM MINATO

 Tune in again!

 The Formation of Team Minato

 I wish he'd stop messing around! Who wants to be together with him?! Don't be so upset. Kakashi is already leaving the team. Still… Um, excuse me. By "Kakashi," are you talking
about Kakashi Hatake? Who are you? Kakashi and I were at
the Academy together. Oh, so you're friends? No, I wouldn't call us "friends." He's pretty nasty, right? We can't complete a mission
with a guy like that. Mission? Oh, right… Kakashi is already
going on missions. Did something happen? That guy always prioritizes
the mission over everything. Even if his teammate is hurt,
or is left behind in enemy territory. There's no way
we can work with him. If you ever have to
team up with him, be careful. Prioritizes...the mission? I'll save my friends,
no matter what. That's my Ninja Way. Him? He'd do that? Say, Rin…
Do you see Kakashi these days? No, I only catch glimpses
of him in town. I think he's away on missions
most of the time. Why? I heard some rumors
about Kakashi yesterday. They weren't good rumors. Last time I saw him,
he seemed to have changed a lot too. Could it be something to do
with his father? Do you know something? Well, no… Oh, I see. Okay, Obito. See you tomorrow! Yeah. Kakashi… Hey, Kakashi! How's it going? I've been hearing a lot about you. Looks like you've been
seeing a lot of action. Hey, did something happen? If something's on your mind… I'm not so desperate that
I need you to worry about me. Hey…you… Leave me alone. Kakashi… I found you, Obito! Rin! Are you all right?! I just slipped. I'm okay. I'm okay. You're training in this rain? Yeah... I figured I have to try harder
if I'm going to catch up to that guy. "That guy"? I mean, Kakashi. One day, I'll surprise him. Otherwise, I can't become
the Hokage. Besides, he's already going
on missions. I have to work harder or the gap
between us will get bigger! That's the spirit!
Go for it, Obito! Yeah! Excuse me. You wanted to see me? I want to ask you a favor. Kakashi Hatake is
an extremely talented shinobi. However, he fusses too much
about sticking to the rules and clashes with his superiors
and teammates. He may excel in technique,
but as a human, he has much to learn. His father broke the rules
to protect his comrades, and then took his own life… His death has cast
a shadow over Kakashi. And you want to place him
under my supervision... Oh no, oh no! GRADUATION CEREMONY
 I can't believe you were late for both your entrance and
graduation ceremonies! Graduation is over! But there was this old lady… You have an awfully high rate
of encounters with old people, don't you? Lately…I've been getting ambushed
by a lot of them. That sounds premeditated! Really… Come on… This way! Here is the graduation certificate
for Obito Uchiha! "This certifies that
you have graduated "from the Hidden Leaf Ninja Academy. "You are commended
for persevering "through the rain and wind
to reach this milestone!" Here! Congratulations! Rin… Thank you, Rin. No one's here to watch… But this makes me happier than
receiving it from that old-man Hokage! We're genin now,
so you have shape up. Yeah, I know. We'll now be part of a 3-man squad
and go on missions, right? Have the teams already
been announced? Yes, they have. So, are you and me… Well… Don't tell me… we're on different… Unfortunately,
we're on the same team! No way! Yup. I'm stuck looking
after you again… Yes! Yes! And who's the third member? About that... You're late, Obito! You're finally here.
You must be Obito. We've been waiting for you. Barely made it… You're really late. I'm Minato, your leader from today.
Glad to meet you. Yeah! Anyway, let's have
our first training session together. R-Right! In this session,
I want to see your teamwork. Teamwork? And the exercise will be…this. You all pass! All right... We'll start our first mission tomorrow. That's more like it! I'll show what I've got
in a real battle! Actually, this first mission
is inside the village. Like finding a lost pet
or a lost item. Those are just odd jobs! A mission is a mission. If you succeed, then I'll assign
more important missions. Kakashi, you've been on
many missions already and this may seem boring, but do your best anyway. Okay! Kakashi, I challenge you! Let's see who can
complete more missions. That's stupid. Do as you please. You chicken? What did you say? It's not here. It's not here. Found it? No. It's not here either. Looking for a lost pet
isn't easy, is it? But if we can't succeed
at something like this, our team will never be sent
on real missions. By the way, where's Obito? He was determined to
do everything alone, and went off somewhere. Is he serious about beating me? Oh, Obito… That cat was on the rooftop
up ahead basking in the sun. Obito, I saw that thing
on a park bench. Oh right, by the way, I have some yummy sweets
you can take with you. Finding a lost pet, and a lost item! Solved them both,
thanks to the grannies. And I even got treats! You're so popular
with the old ladies, Obito. You really weren't lying
all those times were you late. "One good deed deserves another." This time, Obito's kindness
was returned. How's that, Kakashi?! All the odd jobs in the village
were taken care of in one day. Right? It's because I'm the man
who will become the Hokage! This is nothing! Lord Hokage, I believe this team
is far more skilled than we thought. You're right. Kakashi already
has lots of field experience. Perhaps I shall send them along
with you on your mission tomorrow. On Minato Sensei's mission?! Is this a real mission?! Yes. And the client specifically
requested Minato. It's a C-rank mission. Although the risk is low, I'd be lying if I said
there's absolutely none. I was planning to assign you
to more odd jobs in the village while Minato was away. But there are no more requests. And, I can't let you just
wait around. Yes! This means we're going
on our first real mission. Okay then… I'm counting on you all from tomorrow. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! Well, Kakashi?! You should be grateful to me. I'm the only reason why
there are no more odd jobs to do. Kakashi, don't get upset with Obito. Obito's been worried about you
for a long time. He thinks you've changed… W-What're you saying, Rin?! Well, it's true. And you always said that
Kakashi was better than you… So you trained hard to catch up! Did not! I never said that! You're imagining things! Come on, let's all shake hands. We're on the same team now. I'm not shaking hands with this guy! Really… You're both hopeless! Then… I'll connect the both of you. Okay guys, for this mission, we will be escorting shinobi
from another village. One of them is carrying
a secret missive. CONFIDENTIAL

Namely, that's what we are guarding. There will also be three other escorts
from the requesting village. If fighting breaks out… First and foremost, I want you three
to make sure you're safe. Understood? All right! I'm gonna show my stuff big-time
and make it to Hokage! It's not going to be that easy. Obito, were you even listening
to Minato Sensei? We are not to engage in
any kind of battle. Besides, we'd only get
in Minato Sensei's way. Is he really that amazing? Haven't you ever heard of
the Yellow Flash of the Leaf? I have. He's an incredible shinobi whose fame
has spread to other villages too. And he's our teacher,
Minato Namikaze, the man touted to become
the next Hokage. Seriously?! Someone that great
is teaching us? I feel my blood rushing! Man, I wish someone
would attack us. Jeez… Hey, I wonder who's stronger, the Yellow Flash of the Leaf
or the White Fang of the Leaf? O-Obito! The Hidden Leaf had a hero
named the White Fang. But I heard he died
protecting the village. Haven't you heard of him? No, I haven't. Kakashi? What's with him? This is strange. We're surrounded… There are quite a few of them. What's going on? This is far more dangerous than
the rank assigned to this mission. I have to stop them here
before I'm completely surrounded. Bringing along the team
might have been a mistake. Who can I depend on? He can guard one person. I'll have to guard the other one. Everyone, listen up. What is it, Sensei? Looks like the enemy is on our tail. Seriously?! We're gonna fight?! Obito! This is not a game! Uh, yes sir... There are quite a few of them. Obito and I will track back
to confront them. In the meantime, Kakashi
and Rin will complete the mission. It's imperative that you two escape. – Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir! All right… Let's go, Obito! Roger! Oh man, Minato Sensei! To have you pick me
instead of Kakashi... This just means you depend on me! Obito, we're going to lure
the enemy without a fight and separate them
from the main group. I know that! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Oh, not bad. I wasn't kidding about
practicing every day! I'll take down
every single one of them! Don't get carried away!
I said no fighting! Obito! You're in the way! He's strong! You're just a kid! You can't beat me with that! Damn it! I'm not going to lose here! I'm… …gonna become the Hokage! I did it! A shadow clone?! You're mine! Not good! Are you all right? Minato Sensei! This is not good… They're here. Rin! Go on ahead! Got it. Damn—! Kakashi! We have to save him! Minato Sensei is still
nearby right now! If we turn back and let him know… No! A shinobi's duty is to
carry out his mission! Kakashi… Run! Getting away is imperative! Once we're in the forest,
the village will be near! They won't pursue us that far! Understood! We've come this far.
We should be safe. What about Obito? Sensei is with him.
I'm sure they're fine. Thank you. I must hand it to
the Yellow Flash's team. Thanks to you, the secret missive
will be delivered safely. Don't mention it. Unfortunately, one man had
to be sacrificed. That could not be helped. However…he won't be… the only sacrifice! What the—?! What's going on? S-So you're…the traitors! Since you were just so focused
on completing the mission, you made our mission easy. Even someone like the Yellow Flash
can't span this distance quickly. Sorry, but you're going
to have to die too. No way… Kakashi, you didn't...

 You didn't leave someone
to die, did you?

 I only prioritized the mission.
I followed the rules.

 But the result of doing that,
is all this!

 Stop, Obito.

 What happened is something
that could not be foreseen.

 It's not Kakashi's fault.

 Damn it. I'm going.

 Where are you going?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"You'll Be My Backup"

 Isn't it obvious?! I'm going
to go save those guys!

 YOU'LL BE MY BACKUP

 Tune in again!

 You'll Be My Backup

 Rin, get out of here! But…! You're going to get in my way! Earth Style! Mud Wall! Damn, they got away! Wha—?! From inside the Earth Style?! Rin! I'll start treatment immediately! What happened, Kakashi?! Minato Sensei! Obito… Kakashi? Rin? What am I doing here? I'll explain later. First, Kakashi… What happened here? We escorted them safely to this point, but the other two were traitors… Two of them? Please, I'm not going to make it. The contents of the secret missive… But we can't look at its contents… Don't worry about it. Please, just confirm that
it's the real one. What does this mean? My superior told me that another teammate and I would
both be handed secret missives. And only one of them would
be the real one. Why?! There was intel that there could be
a traitor among us. So who has the real missive? If the traitor had it,
he wouldn't have attacked me. So… It was him. Kakashi, where's the other guy? Well, on our way here… Please, you must get
the secret missive! There's nothing I can do. Damn it, did they hear us? Kakashi. You didn't leave someone
to die, did you? I only prioritized the mission. I followed the rules. The rules? Those who don't follow
the rules are scum. But look at the result! If you hadn't turned your back
on your comrade, this wouldn't have happened! Stop, Obito! This was an unexpected incident. Kakashi is not to blame. Damn it! I'm going! Go where? Isn't it obvious?! I'm going to save that guy! But he's right in
the unexpected incident. He's right. It's too dangerous. I'm not about to fail
my first mission! We didn't fail. This was an unforeseen occurrence! Kakashi, for an honor student,
you're pretty dumb. What did you say? Think about it. The four guys we were supposed
to guard have all disappeared. Who's gonna support our claim
that this was all unexpected? If the village who requested
this mission pretends to not have known
about the traitors… Minato Sensei will be forced
to take responsibility! Never mind me. Our mission is over, Obito. All I want to say is… Sensei, you can keep dragging me
back to the village, but I won't give up searching
for the guy. I never turn my back
on a comrade! – Obito!
– Obito! Damn it. I guess it's useless to try
and stop you. Then I'll go back to where he fell. Kakashi, you check downstream. And Obito, check beyond that. Rin, you go with Kakashi. Right! Listen up. Report to me
the minute you find him. He's here! We found him. Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! There are too many enemies. Lighting Style! Chidori! Are you all right?! Rin! Take care of him! Got it! Let's get away from here. Wait! The scroll! Withdraw! Obito! Rin!
Guard him! What about you, Kakashi?! I'm getting the scroll back! That's reckless!
You saw how many there were! I won't let you complain! If saving him is your Ninja Way,
completing the mission is mine. Kakashi! Obito, we have to contact
Minato Sensei! Yeah! Obito! You bastard, do think you can
take us all on by yourself? I will complete my mission. Kill him. Obito! Did you find him? Kakashi went after the enemy
to get the scroll back! Kakashi did what? I hope I make it in time! Come on! Don't let him…get away! Rasen-Flash Super-Circle
Dance Howl Stage Three! Minato Sensei. So, were you able to uphold
the principles you believe in? This completes the mission. Yes… Thank you for saving my life. The Yellow Flash of the Leaf…
I hope we meet again someday. All right then, let's go everyone. Sensei, missions are
really difficult, aren't they? You're right. Things don't always go
the way you envision them. But I'm glad the secret missive
was delivered safely. Yes… So we successfully
completed the mission. Probably. "Probably"? What do you mean? Back there, he said… Thank you for saving my life. If the mission was successful, he would be more concerned
about the secret missive and not his life. What do you mean?! The missive he had
was also a fake. We were probably decoys. Another team delivered
the real missive. That's the real reason
they requested Minato Sensei for a C-rank mission. With Minato Sensei as the escort, it would seem that we were
really guarding the real thing. When did you figure that out? I thought it was a possibility when we discovered
the first missive was a fake. And you risked your life
to go after a missive that could have been a fake? That was the mission. That's my Ninja Way. I thought I understood
a little about you. But I didn't understand a thing… I finally understood… on our last mission together. Kakashi is the son of
the genius Ninja, Sakumo Hatake, feared as the "White Fang"
of the Leaf. The White Fang? Then that incident? But… Kakashi's never said
a word about him. He was a great man… Someone respected by everyone
in the village, and naturally, by Kakashi himself. That is, until that incident… Incident? Perhaps, I shouldn't be telling you
something like this… But since you're on
the same team as Kakashi, I want you to know. What happened? Kakashi's father, Sakumo,
took his own life after being slandered. Five years ago, he was the leader of a top-secret mission
to infiltrate enemy territory. He was forced to make a choice. To execute the mission
or save his comrades' lives… Of course, according to
the rules of the village, completing the mission
was the right thing to do. However, in order to save
the lives of his comrades, he suspended the mission. That resulted in grave losses
to the Land of Fire and the village, and he was blamed for it. What's more, the very comrades
he saved also criticized him. The whole ordeal took its toll on
Sakumo, both physically and mentally. And finally, he took his own life. From then on, Kakashi never uttered
a word about his father, and he strictly began to adhere
to every rule and regulation. Obito… Try to understand,
even if it's just a little. Kakashi means well. Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! We're taking this one. Wait! Damn it! Obito, don't go after them! What did you say? The two of us will continue
this mission. Do you realize what you just said?! Yeah… A shinobi must sacrifice a comrade
if the mission is at stake. That's the rule. You're willing to simply abandon
a comrade who's been through
life and death with you, for something like that?! You don't understand anything… about what happens to people
who break the rules. I believe the White Fang
was a true hero. It's true. In the Shinobi World, someone who breaks the rules
and regulations is regarded as scum… But… those who abandon their comrades
are worse than scum! I found them… Kakashi… Why are you—?! That silver-white hair and
White Chakra Blade! Don't tell me you're…
the "White Fang" of the Leaf?! This is a memento of my father's. I see. You're the White Fang's kid. Then there's no need
to be afraid of you. Where is he? Obito, behind you! My eye! Kakashi! A shinobi shouldn't cry… I'm not dead yet. Don't lose focus. I'm always just talk… Other people are always saving me… But… Those who abandon their comrades
are worse than scum! I don't want them
to be empty words. Die! H-How? There's no way you can see me! Obito…You—! W-What is that eye? This time, I'll take point and
you'll be my backup, Kakashi. It's been a while since
we were a two-man squad. Don't stumble, Obito. Are you prepared for this? Yeah… I'm glad my final op will
have been with you. Obito…Kakashi. Obito, I'm taking back everything
I loaned you. Especially that left eye… Are you worried, Madara? You told me once that
only with both together could the Sharingan's true power
be unleashed. And so… You're wrong. Those are Rinnegan,
not just Sharingan. You're wrong. I was talking about these eyes. We're finally all together! You're late again! A lot happened on my way here
and I got lost… How come every path
you take is a roundabout route? Just walk a straight line! I told you, a lot of stuff happened
along the way! A shinobi must follow the rules! Your carelessness could end up
putting your comrades in danger! Then I'll just protect you guys! Instead of obeying the rules! Do you know what
you're even saying?! Eyes speak louder than words! Once my Sharingan are awakened,
they won't be silent! Your Sharingan won't amount
to anything! Besides, they're not awakened yet,
so shut up! You shut up! Obviously, you must talk too much since you have to keep
your mouth covered with a mask! So you shut up! They're not falling into line
at all, are they? That's for sure. But you know, Sensei… I challenge you, Kakashi! Not you again, Beast Face! Leave us alone! How did I end up with
classmates like these? In order to resurrect Naruto, they need the Rinnegan
and the Nine Tails. Obito has them both, so as long as I don't allow him
to teleport away to his time-space… And I've already discovered that my attacks are faster than
their Kamui's transfer speed. There's no doubt one of them
will try to distract me while the other performs the Kamui. Obito will teleport himself or
have Kakashi teleport him. This time, I'll take point and
you'll be my backup, Kakashi. Whatever they decide,
I'll be able to stop Obito again. I should keep it fast and
simple with Limbo… No… I shouldn't use that as long as
Obito still has the Rinnegan. Then I'll attack them
both simultaneously! But you know, Sensei… Let me handle this. I'll make the two of them—! Let's go…you guys! Kamui! They both released their Kamui
at the same time! And doubled the speed of the jutsu! Obito! Don't worry. I'm here to help Naruto… Can I trust you? Ever since I was a kid, I've never been able to walk
a straight path. But I've finally gotten to
where I needed to go. You actually had
perfect timing for once. Thanks for saving Kakashi… Guy! Are you all right, Kakashi?! I've seen you before. Who is that? You maybe reinforcements,
but you're nothing more than pebbles.

 You won't make any difference
at this point.

 That's Madara?

 Only Senjutsu works against him…

 and one more thing: physical attacks
such as Taijutsu.

 So, it's show time for
the wild blue beast, eh?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Blue Beast vs. Six Paths Madara"

 Eight Inner Gates!

 Seventh Gate of Shock! Open!

 THE BLUE BEAST vs.
SIX PATHS MADARA

 Tune in again!

 There's someone else
where Sasuke is. Do you recognize the chakra? No! But… But what? This chakra… …has a real nasty feel to it! Then we need to hurry even more. We don't know what
this stranger might do to Sasuke. Is this the end for him? Damn it… Karin! If you up the pace too much,
you're going to collapse soon. Let's head to the others with
youth power to the max! Lee! Tenten! The Blue Beast vs. Six Paths Madara

 Sasuke! Who is that guy?! Hey you! I don't know who the hell you are,
but what are you doing to Sasuke? Oh, so that's what's going on… Huh? So it was you… …Kabuto. I sensed a group rushing this way… It was you, after all, Lord Orochimaru. That's Kabuto?! His chakra is different! Even his appearance. He has taken in the chakra
of many people, even Sage Jutsu chakra. It's no wonder even you thought
he was someone else, Karin… I wonder if his chakra
had a nasty feel to it because he still has
some of mine inside him? – Or…
– Get away from Sasuke, you brainy jerk! What brings you here, Lord Orochimaru? I should ask you the same thing. What are you planning, Orochimaru? Mister Kabuto… Don't tell me you're going
to absorb Sasuke? And would that make you
Kabuke or Sasuto? You're the one who
did this to Sasuke?! You bastard! Suigetsu… I don't desire to
do that anymore. Nor am I going to steal Sasuke, Karin. Sasuke's chakra! I can faintly sense it! No way! Kabuto… You're helping Sasuke? Yes. With my Medical ninjutsu and
much-tinkered cells of Hashirama, along with a certain
someone's suggestion, I managed to stop him from dying. He's right. Huh?! Well, well… if it isn't the man I most respect… the Second Hokage,
Lord Tobirama Senju. However, Kabuto… You being here means that you were able to slip out of the infinite loop
set up by Itachi's Izanami? You're right. I was unable to acknowledge myself,
I didn't even know who I was. That allowed you to give me
easy answers and use me. Making me lose myself even more. If you're not satisfied with
what you've had so far… Just find other things and
add them onto yourself… one by one. It's still… It's still not enough… This is…still not me! But with that jutsu,
Itachi made me realize… that I am none other…than Kabuto… …and where my home is. Does it seem like the person inside has changed too? That is the jutsu known as Izanami. The jutsu is set up so that
you cannot undo it until you reflect upon yourself
and accept who you are. Sasuke... Now I wish from the bottom of my heart to not lose my home. And Itachi, who wanted to
protect Sasuke even unto death… His feelings have pierced
through my heart strongly. Hey! Isn't it a little too late
to say things like that? You teamed up with that fake Madara! You guys started this war! You're right. Both Obito and I… …thought we'd lost our place in this world. And dragged everyone else into this. But, I now know who I am. And what I must do! You may be reinforcements,
but you're nothing more than pebbles. You won't make any difference
at this point. That's Madara?! Yes, that's him. Kakashi, are you all right? Yes, thanks to Guy. I don't mean that. I'm talking about my Sage Art
Rasengan hitting you earlier. That was okay too. I diverted it with my Kamui just as it was making contact. Kamui! I'm glad… Sage Art? You mean, senjutsu? Yes. Only senjutsu works against him… As well as… physical attacks such as taijutsu. Which means our only hope is
the Fourth Hokage's senjutsu and your taijutsu, Guy. If I recall, Sensei, senjutsu isn't your forte… Yes. In all honesty, I'm weak in senjutsu. It takes me too long to infuse the chakra and I can't maintain it very long. I haven't used it very much
in combat either. Furthermore, in this state,
I can't weave signs, so I don't think
I can even fight effectively. So, it's showtime for the wild blue beast, eh? Eight Inner Gates! Seventh Gate of Shock! Open! Blue vapor? Guy! Eight Inner Gates… One gate before the Gate of Death… He insults me, not bringing out the Red Vapor. Don't let the black spheres
or rod touch you! Who could've imagined Guy
mastering the Eight Gates! Those are not human movements! Take this! Hirudora! Afternoon Tiger! I have to use
the Flying Raijin once more to throw myself into
the Black Sphere's path! Kakashi, take the kunai! Right! Rock Lee! Guy Sensei! Are you all right? Yes. Thanks, Lee. How is Tenten? She wanted to check something out,
and made me go on ahead. Just when I was about to catch up... all of a sudden
the Hirudora appeared. Are you all right, Guy? Yeah. Only my right arm and
a few ribs are hurt. What are we going to do
if our last ray of hope, your taijutsu… is no good? He's…too strong. Wait, Kakashi… It's too soon to decide
my taijutsu won't work! But… Our youth hasn't faded yet! Do not lose hope! Guy Sensei… It's true that everything we wish for
will not come to be... But things that we must do must always begin with a wish. Just like the times I challenged you. I challenge you, Kakashi! And this is not a bluff. Don't tell me... you're going to—! The end has come for
the Leaf's Blue Beast… It's time for the Red Beast to emerge! No way… Not the final Gate of Death! Guy! Don't do that! Think it over hard! No one here wishes for that! Not even you father would... No! But I wish it. Guy Sensei! Do you really think it's that time? Lee, don't look at me like that. This time, you sit back
and enjoy the show! You remind me of myself back then, when I was
a complete failure. Now, in matches against
that elite genius Kakashi, we're nearly even. "Even if I cannot do ninjutsu or genjutsu… I want to prove that can still
become a splendid ninja?" Isn't that your Ninja Way? That's a fine goal. It's a goal worth fighting for. So you must believe in your path
and run hard toward it! Become strong so I can just sit back
and enjoy the show! Father… Yes, I'm in! Congratulations! Not there… not there… not there! ACADEMY ACCEPTANCE RESULTS Not there… not there… not there… There, I see it! We did it! Congratulations! Yes! I got in! My son, search to your heart's content! It's not there… My name is nowhere on the list, Papa! Then keep on looking, Guy! You have worked hard and
done everything you possibly could. There is no way all that effort
will not be rewarded. Those tears are blurring your vision.
You will see your name soon. Yes! Might Guy… Might Guy… Might Guy... He just won't give up, will he? It's very unsightly. KAKASHI HATAKE Papa, I'm sorry… I'm so sorry… Do not give up, Guy! Don't turn away! You will find it! You will! ACADEMY ORIENTATION IF I RUN 500 LAPS, I'LL BE ACCEPTED
AS AN ALTERNATE Isn't that the kid who was making
such a fuss about failing the test? This is for my papa who never
gave up on me too… I'll definitely get in! What does he mean by "self rule"? He can't just decide something like that! I know about it… He cannot perform ninjutsu
or genjutsu at all. The only thing he has going for him
is to move his body around. That may be so,
but he looks ready to drop. Guy, don't give up. But you've got it all wrong! T-Two hundred thirty-five...laps… He's not even half way done! Papa... Guy! You fool! I'm sorry, Papa… I'm already five years old,
but I can't even run 500 laps… Do not apologize! I'm not scolding you because of that! Never apologize for trying hard! It's an insult to your determination, Guy! Then why? You're applying your self-rule
in the wrong manner! Doing 500 laps will qualify you
for the vacant place in the academy? That's not a self-rule! That's just a wish! The kind you go on a pilgrimage for! You see, you impose a self-rule on yourself
to spur you on and help you overcome
a challenge or difficult situation. You apply a self-rule on yourself only. Because of that rule, you are able to gather your strength
and focus on your efforts… So even if you fail, applying that rule keeps you
extremely disciplined and focused. That is the way a self-rule works. I'm sorry, Papa… However, no one can find fault
in your determination. Even if you can only make it half way, effort is effort. And for that, you deserve a big hug! Papa! Guy! Oh…there they go again,
that father and son. Isn't that abuse? Anyway, what's with those bodysuits? Gross! Thank you for your support! Papa, I don't think that was support... Then, encouragement. I guess…I can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu… so that's why I failed the test… Listen, Guy! Your youth has just begun! Do not turn your back on your youth! Just like me! As your father, I'm happy that ninjutsu
and genjutsu aren't your strong points! Knowing your shortcomings
will highlight your strengths! Your taijutsu is already
shining brilliantly! I'm very happy! I've discovered my own child's strengths
when he's still so young! Papa, you're just saying that, aren't you? Shortcomings can become strengths! Being repetitious is just being polite! To be loud is simply to be lively! Obstinacy is merely earnestness! Those who are selfish are like cats! What about hairy people? Mmm... Th-They're like cats too! What about people with long torsos…? Th-They're like cats! Hey, Might Dai… Are you playing "training"
with your son again? You sure work hard for a perennial genin! Yeah! Thanks for your support! Damn it! Still trying to
act young at his age. Right? Oww! What?! Aren't you Dai's kid?! What's the big idea? Don't you ever say anything stupid
about my papa ever again! Stupid is as stupid does.
I just spoke the truth. If you say one bad word about Papa,
I'll punch you five times! That's my self-rule! Your self-rule? Interesting. So I'll say it. Your dad is a good-for-nothing
who can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu, and can't even do taijutsu that well. You know what they say? He's more a comedian
than a genin. Yeah, a comedian who
only tells jokes about youth isn't funny! You said two bad things! That's ten punches! And we'll punch you 20 times! Damn it! I can't believe you couldn't
return a single punch after what they said about your father. Why did you do such a thing?

 Papa, how can you stay
so positive and optimistic?

 When does one's youth come to an end?

 As long as you never turn
your back against youth...

 it never ends.

 Then are you saying your youth won't
come to an end when you die, Papa?

 What are you saying, Guy?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Papa's Youth"

 That is when youth climaxes!

 When it burns the brightest!

 PAPA'S YOUTH

 Tune in again!

 Papa's Youth

 Guy, why did you do
such a thing?! Papa… Papa… How can you stay
so positive and optimistic? When does one's youth
come to an end? As long as you never turn your back
against youth, it never ends. Then are you saying your youth won't come
to an end when you die, Papa?! What are you saying, Guy?! That is when youth climaxes! When it burns the brightest! There's something wrong
with you, Papa! Youth doesn't matter
a bit when you die! You can believe in it until you die, but there's no guarantee you'll win
against someone strong! Just like me… True victory isn't about winning
against someone strong. It's about defending
what's important to you! I just wanted… to protect this youth that
you always talk about! THE FOLLOWING HAVE BEEN
ACCEPTED AS ACADEMY ALTERNATES:
FURUSUGI TOSUI
HII TOGAKURE Deciding someone's future is
something one never gets used to. RULE…RUN 500 LAPS…
ACADEMY…
ACCEPTED AS AN ALTERNATE! THE FOLLOWING HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED
AS ACADEMY ALTERNATES:
FURUSUGI TOSUI
HII TOGAKURE
MIGHT GUY – Papa!
– Guy! Those two are at it again. Someone should report them soon. Oh! My son's efforts have been rewarded! I've been accepted
as an alternate! – Thank you for your support!
– Thank you for your support! Clone Jutsu! Well, that's a start. Kakashi Hatake,
let's see your clone! What's wrong? Step up to the front and—! Awesome! You are Sakumo's son, after all… To be able to do
a Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu. Papa… There really are people
who can be considered geniuses! Next, Might Guy. Step up to the front. Y-Yes! All right, let's see
your Clone Jutsu. Y-Yes… He can't even do ninjutsu… Aw man, looks like
he's gonna pee in his pants! Hurry up and do it! All right! Clone Jutsu! Who wants to wear that?! Who'd wear something that ugly! As Papa said, I do have something
that shines brilliantly! Yes… My taijutsu is already
shining brilliantly. That's right.
What they say doesn't matter! I'm my own self! I'll follow Papa, and do
my best according to my self-rule! If I can't do 500 laps,
I'll do 500 handstands! If I can't do 500 laps on my hands,
I'll do 500 push-ups! If I can't do push-ups…
I'll do them on my fingers… 500… F-Fifteen… He couldn't do any of them! He can't even do taijutsu! Papa told me… Effort always…always pays off! You fool! I have no doubt that boy
will become your lifelong rival! So why don't you challenge him?! That's crazy… He's a genius.
It's obvious I'd lose… And so what if you do? I'll go with you, so let's go
find this Kakashi boy. W-Wait! B-But… O-Okay, I'll follow my self-rule. Oh? Your self-rule! If I can't do 500 laps
around the school, I'll challenge Kakashi! Well said, Guy!
That's more like my son! – Thank you for your support!
– Thank you for your support! 496… I can't do it…after all… Huh? I'm not that exhausted…? Huh? I can keep going? The 500th lap! I did it! I don't have to challenge him… If I can't do 500 laps… I'll challenge…Kakashi… 498… 500 laps! I did it again! 500…501… 502…503… 504… He's making it look easy. He's totally doing it… 753…754… 755…756…757… I see… So you haven't been able
to challenge Kakashi yet. But you're following
your self-rules, so that's that. Yes. You realize it's because
you're doing such a good job honing your strong points? And now, I'm going to
challenge myself by going up and down
this mountain 500 times! That was cold! If the genius trains just as hard… what chance do I have to beat him? But…I just don't want to lose in
hard work and perseverance. Is that boy Kakashi? Yes. I was wrong. There's nothing wrong with wishing… or praying for success…
as a self-rule. That boy intimidates you,
doesn't he? When I can do 5000 laps
around the schoolyard… I'll challenge Kakashi! Well said, my son! Do your best, my son! The road of your youth
stretches out before you! 345! Go! Run and keep on running! 500… Guy… Keep on going! 1507… The springtime of youth
still chases after you! 2849… I want to challenge you! I will not lose! 5000…laps! Congratulations, Guy! Papa… So this is youth. So? How about we lay our youth
on the line for a hot-blooded battle? If it's taijutsu, I won't lose to you! It's heavy! Leaf Hurricane! Here I go! Come on! Rock, Paper, Scissors! – Again! Again! Again! Again!
– Again! Again! Again! Again! Guy! Congratulations on graduating
from the Academy! But you cannot graduate from youth! Of course! I don't care if I die
as a remnant of youth! I will stay forever in
the academy we call youth! – Thank you for your support!
– Thank you for your support! Operation Cat Rescue…successful! Lord Hokage praised me as
the master of finding cats! Oh… Isn't that wonderful? But, is this the climax of
your youth, Papa? Depending on how things go with
the Third Great Ninja War, there may be changes
in team formations. But for now, I'm your team captain,
Choza Akimichi. Since fate has brought us
all together as a team… Please forgive me! I'll never make
this mistake again! You say that, but you keep making the same mistake
over and over again. – I have no choice but to drop you.
– Please, not that! You keep asking me… But I'm tired of hearing
that from you. Please, give me another chance! I'll take any mission.
I'll work harder than ever before! I beg you! Please! Please! How can he humiliate himself
like that? That's not youth. Isn't that how he raised you though? I don't think there's
a cooler shinobi out there… …than your dad. True victory isn't about winning
against someone strong. It's about defending
what's important to you! Father… Guy, you've grown into
a fine young man… There's only one thing left
that I'm able to do for you. Now pay close attention, Guy. Father… What is this?! The Eight Inner Gates… A type of Forbidden Jutsu! Father mastered such
a technique? When did he…? As a genin, I practiced every day, and finally grasped this unique jutsu
after twenty years. Twenty years! To put it plainly, this is the one and only jutsu that
I can pass on to you as your father. And it shall become
a most special technique to you! Special? You have become
a splendid shinobi! But I shall impose
one strict condition upon the use of this technique. A self-rule! A self-rule… Father… His chakra is spreading toward
the Death Gate's Chakra Point. Father… The Eighth Gate…of Death! It's no good… We're surrounded. There's no way we can escape. No way… Aren't they the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist?! So even brats from other villages
know who we are? We've gotten pretty famous. What's this? It's slight,
but the blade's gotten chipped! I have to let it suck some blood… …and restore it with iron. What'll we do? We can't take
them on by ourselves! I made it just in time! Father! You're a genin, Father! What're doing here?! Never mind, just run away! I'll buy you some time! Run away?! Father! They are jonin, plus,
they're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen! You're no match for them! I have the Gate of Death…
the Eight Inner Gates Formation! But that's—! I'm going by my self-rule! Now is the time… Open! Eight Inner
Gates Formation! …to protect something precious enough
to give your life for! Guy, are you really going to—! I can't believe this. Red vapor… The unique vapor of blood…
from the opening of all eight gates… But actually seeing it
with my own eyes… It's almost like the color
of dead autumn leaves that have fallen off their tree… You're right. But they're not falling
for any reason or purpose… They become the nutrients… for fresh green leaves! And the period they bridge, until the new spring
when fresh leaves bud… …is the climax of youth!
When it burns most crimson! Sekizo, Evening Elephant! What has Might Guy done?

 The Eight Inner Gates Formation.

 A move that allows one to draw out
one's maximum power

 by releasing the limiters
placed on it.

 The release of
all Eight Limiters results

 in power tens of times greater
than that of the Five Kage.

 But…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Eight Inner Gates Formation"

 You're the first since Hashirama
to make me feel this excited!

 THE EIGHT INNER GATES
FORMATION

 Tune in again!

00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,230
Simply unbelievable... the things this child can do... <i>Oh shoot...</i> <i>Orochimaru vs. Jinchuriki


</i> I don't believe this... The fourth tail has appeared. <i>The fourth tail?</i> <i>The Chakra leaking out is unstable...</i> It's trying to shift even closer
to the Nine-Tail form... <i>The Nine-Tailed Chakra is different in
<i>quality and quantity than any before.</i> <i>More than anything,
<i>it has a strong evil aura.</i> <i>Besides using Naruto's body
<i>as a vehicle...</i> <i>That is truly...</i> <i>A small Nine-Tail in and of itself!</i> <i>Such incredible shockwaves...
<i>Just from a swing of his arm, geez!</i> <i>At this rate, there's no way
<i>I can move closer...</i> Was this also Naruto's...? That's right. Captain Yamato... You know something... about Naruto, don't you? What in the world
happened to Naruto? Sakura...you don't need to worry. It is for that very reason. and for times like this... that I was chosen by my superiors... as Team Captain. <i>Someone overwhelmed
<i>with that much Chakra...</i> <i>Normally...</i> <i>how could he still be moving?</i> It seems Sasori
won't be coming here, now is he...? Kabuto... It seems Sasori
won't be coming here, now is he...? The only person
who was supposed to know that I was coming here today
was Sasori... Not even the other Akatsuki members
were privy to that information. But despite that,
you Leaf guys are here... It would be hard
to believe that Sasori... would confess under torture... Which means that he gave out
the information of his own volition. Most likely, his intention was
for you to get information... about Orochimaru out of me... and then have the Leaf Village
dispose of him. Because Orochimaru has proven
to be too tough a customer ... for the Akatsuki guys, too. Your disguise earlier on... was perfect... <i>If you hadn't pulled out
<i>a Kunai Knife,</i> <i>I wouldn't have been able
<i>to get away before I noticed.</i> <i>This kid you sent to me...
<i>has come in very handy.</i> Unless one of you has met directly
with Sasori, it wouldn't have evolved that way... Most likely Sasori gave you
the information about today at that time... <i>In ten days at midday,</i> <i>go to Tenchi Bridge located
<i>in the Village Hidden in the Grass.</i> <i>One of Orochimaru's subordinates
<i>is my spy.</i> <i>I was to rendezvous...with him there.</i> Of course, it was probably based on... the assumption that the Jutsu
placed on me was still in affect. The fact that Sasori would
go out of his way to do that... means that he's acknowledged
your strength... Sasori holds a grudge
against Orochimaru. He was always saying that he wanted
to personally execute Orochimaru... But to act against his own will
and send you guys here means... that he is already in a situation
in which he is unable to do that... In other words... he has either been captured... or he is already dead. Unfortunately it's the latter... That's delightful... <i>What's this...?</i> <i>That's...!</i> <i>Could that be Chakra?</i> <i>That looks like trouble.</i> <i>Anyone who has Chakra
<i>that high in density...</i> <i>will most certainly die.</i> <i>Naruto...</i> <i>What the hell are you
<i>going to do...?</i> <i>With that much high-density Chakra
<i>making it difficult...</i> <i>for him to even move...</i> <i>I wonder how he plans
<i>to do battle with me...</i> <i>So that's his move!</i> Triple Rashomon! <i>What an incredible battle!</i> <i>Trying to find
<i>an opening and fight...</i> <i>It doesn't even seem like an option!</i> What in the world...?! <i>What we saw earlier...</i> <i>was definitely Orochimaru's
<i>Triple Rashomon...</i> <i>And in a split second
<i>it got destroyed...</i> <i>It's unbelievable that something
<i>to this extent could have happened.</i> He's gotten even closer to the Nine-Tail
than earlier on, hasn't he? Naruto... Take a look at that. It's no longer a battle of Ninja,
but a battle of monsters. Is that how he wanted to rescue
Sasuke? By becoming like that? Naruto! He's hardly conscious anymore. Really, he is such a pitiful child... That's enough, that's enough, Naruto!
I will rescue Sasuke. Stop! Don't go near him, Sakura. I'll rescue him...
So Naruto, please! Next time:
"Sakura's Tears" Red vapor… The unique vapor of blood from the opening of
all eight gates. But actually seeing it
with my own eyes, it's almost like the color of
dead autumn leaves that have fallen off their tree. You're right. But they're not falling
without reason or purpose. They become the nutrients… for fresh green leaves! And the period they bridge, until the new spring when
fresh leaves bud… is the climax of youth! When it burns most crimson! The Eight Inner Gates Formation

 First Step! Go for it, Guy Sensei! I can… no longer… Guy, is that your—?! That is Sensei's Sekizo,
the Evening Elephant! Second Step! He stopped midway?! The Evening Elephant is supposed
to be a continuous attack that can be shifted up in speed
from one to five times… I see, what unbelievable pain. But I've acclimated. Next time, I can keep it going without
giving him any openings. Great stress is placed on
the body even through the Fifth Gate, the Gate of Closing… I bet the Gate of Death's
level of pain is something that exceeds
my imagination! A taijutsu move that bombards
with blows of punched air… An air cannon, so to speak… Taking four or five of those
would be bad. I should definitely avoid getting hit
by the fists creating them too. Did he succeed?! One rarely gets to fight
the Eight Inner Gates Formation! I'm game! I'll play with you! I figured as much…
He didn't bring him down yet. What has Might Guy done? The Eight Inner Gates Formation… A technique that allows one to
draw out their maximum power by releasing the limiters
placed on it. It's the final stage of the jutsu
Lee used against you in the Chunin Exams long ago. Releasing all eight limiters results
in power tens of times greater than that of the Five Kage. But it's only temporary. After using this technique,
the user will… inevitably die. He's coming towards me
by kicking air! He is… my precious student whom I love. Lee, are you—? I am not sad! Showing any pity or sorrow
to someone who has resolved himself
would be an insult! We must assist Guy. Listen up. Sensei… Those black weapons of his
are troublesome… They're not the activating-from
-nothing type, but an always-on-standby
type that undergo Change in Form. Their impact points disappear, but there is clear sensation
if they make contact with you. Also, he can only send them
about 70 meters out. Any further than that,
and he'll lose control over them. Since they actually exist and
can be seen with the eye, your Kamui should work on them. By sending them away, we can prevent Madara from
controlling them. To be honest, I'm beginning
to lose sight in my left eye. I'll have to get pretty close to
target my Kamui accurately. Gaara, can you prepare some sand? You want me to transport Kakashi
with my sand, right? But my sand isn't fast enough
to avoid his attacks. Don't worry. That's where I come in. I'll have Kakashi carry
one of my kunai. Eight Inner Gates:
The Six Gate of Joy! Open! Lee! You've mastered
the Eight Inner Gates too?! I can only open up to
the Sixth Gate… I've never cursed my own lack
of power as I do now! No… That's enough, Lee. Because you're still… …a fresh new leaf Guy wants
to risk his life to protect! Lee, I want you to stay here
to support and guard Gaara. And one more thing…
Take one of my kunai. First Step! He is fast! Second Step! Third Step! Fourth Step! I can't move! Fifth Step! Just keep forging on, Guy!
No matter what! Here he comes! Great timing, Lee! Kamui! You're the first since Hashirama
to make me feel this excited! Can you still dance? Do you have any
other techniques? Give me some more fun! He got up from a barrage of Sekizo? Where am I? Did I die? What makes thee think
that thou art dead? Thine ethical viewpoint
on death differs much from that which prevailed
in my time… To so easily replace oneself
with the term "death"… Thou must gain mettle,
oh fledgling. Who are you? 'Tis quite a precise query
for this place, but… I am quite uneasy over
whether thou shalt be able to connect my name with
my actions as a herald… I am he who shall achieve
peace and order… My name is Hagoromo. On the other hand… I had foreseen that thou wouldst end up
in such a state as that. Uh…I don't understand
what the hell he's saying. He seems to be one of
those annoying geezers! Hey, gramps, sorry.
But, I… Now then… Hey! Those eyes! Rinnegan! Thou dost appear to
possess observant eyes. All that remains is for thee to pragmatically comprehend
thy circumstances. Thou hast not died yet… This place is thine inner mind. I understand thine haste, – This geezer's not an enemy?
– but at this moment, – This geezer's not an enemy?
– rushing will accomplish naught. But… Can't you speak a little more smoothly,
using easy, normal words? I am an anachronism. Over the passage of much time, cultural traditions and
notions, and ethics have brought about
significant change. Each occurrence where I cross
time and meet a reincarnate, I have come to sense
greatly the differences between the other and myself… I was also able to
formalistically regulate and learn new mores and words, however… Shut up already! I don't have the time
to be sitting around and listening to
some weird geezer! Not just searching for words… But there is ambiguity
in scholarship. If communication of wills
cannot be achieved in addition to difficulty of definition… I see that I must speak simply… taking into account current idealistic
and materialistic thinking. Are you an alien or something? I mean, you seem
super dignified, but… Uh, that's a bit much, doncha think? An alien? Seriously? Well, maybe that ain't too far off.
So anyway… Do you still fail to understand me? To think that conversation would
pose such a complex challenge… No! Keep talking like just now.
I finally get you! I was just shocked because your speaking style
changed so drastically, ya know? Oh, for real? Then I'll keep going like this.
Much pleased! Uh, yeah. Oh but, those words don't match up
with your face at all, so it's kind of super-scary… And he loses all dignity too. You should be just a bit more formal. Otherwise, you come off
kind of dumb. Now you're going too far, no? What do you mean by dumb?! Well, considering how
I was talking before, I guess I can't blame you for that. So how's this then? That's it! All right!
That's perfect! Indeed. I'm getting
the hang of it too. Finally, I can talk with you. So anyway, gramps, who are you? If you know a lot about this place, tell me how to
get out of here! Don't ask so many questions
all at once! I am a person of the past,
someone long dead. A monk who wanders through
this world as chakra, crossing generations, ascertaining
the course of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed. My name is Hagoromo,
the founder of the Ninja Creed. I'm also known as
the Sage of Six Paths. What?! The Sage of Six Paths?! The sage from the legends that
Pervy Sage and Nagato talked about? Oh, so you know about me? Of course I do! You're the one who
created ninjutsu, right? Not ninjutsu…
Ninshu, the Ninja Creed. My Ninja Creed was something
meant to birth hope. Do not confuse it with ninjutsu
which breeds conflict! In any case, if you're the sage, I've got tons of things
I wanna ask you. But first, right now… You are my son Ashura's… Anyway, the conditions are
all in place now. There are things I must
entrust you with. Ashu…ra? Entrust? Quit talking gibberish and
let me out of here! Forgive me... That is something I have
no influence over. That depends on the actions
of those outside. I can only relay things to you. I'm not getting what
you're saying again! It means right now, trying to rush won't make
any difference. So I want you to listen for a bit… No, you must listen… First, about my mother and sons. My mother, Kaguya Otsutsuki, came to this land of yours
from a faraway place. She came in search of
the fruit of the Divine Tree. The chakra fruit of
that same Divine Tree, that you have seen in this war. Kaguya consumed
the fruit, attained power, and subdued this land. Where'd Kaguya come from? Is she stronger than you,
Sage of Six Paths? I guess all moms are scary
when they're mad, huh? It matters not where
she came from. Mother was powerful…
More powerful than any other. Some called my mother
the Rabbit Goddess and others considered her
a demon… They both worshipped her
and feared her. Later, Kaguya would birth two sons. I was one of them. We brothers, to atone for
the crimes mother left behind, battled Ten Tails, an incarnation
of the Divine Tree, and sealed it inside me. The Divine Tree,
robbed of its Chakra Fruit, went on a rampage in
an attempt to recover it. Much, much later,
I had two sons of my own. I named the elder, Indra,
and the younger, Ashura, and I taught them
the Ninja Creed. But there was a huge difference
between the two. One possessed genes containing
my powerful chakra and the other did not. And this difference manifested
itself in an extreme manner. It's getting complicated again,
ya know? What does this all mean? In short… There was the exceptional
older brother, Indra… and the dunce
younger brother, Ashura. A dunce, huh? Even though his dad's
the Sage of Six Paths? Perhaps there's no need
to say this to you, but… No matter how exceptional
both parents may be, there's no guarantee one will
inherit outright either of their abilities. Sound familiar? Just as it seems to have been
in your case, Naruto. For some reason,
I understand that completely. And you are truly similar
to Ashura, in your actions as well. Huh? My actions? Indra and Ashura walked
different paths in life. Elder brother, Indra, possessed
strong Visual Prowess and senses from birth,
and was called a genius. He always did everything alone,
leaning only on his own strength and came to understand that his powers
were different and special. He perceived that power could
achieve everything. On the other hand, nothing ever went well
for the younger brother, Ashura, from the time he was young. And he couldn't do anything
on his own. In order to attain the same power
as his older brother, he needed the cooperation of others
in addition to his own effort. While struggling through training, the power of bodily chakra awakened
within Ashura and he attained power
rivaling his brother's. He came to understand that
he was able to become strong, thanks to the cooperation and
help of those around him. He learned of the love for others that
arises from thinking about others… And perceived that it was love
that can achieve everything. In the way that the younger one
chose to live his life… I thought I caught a glimpse
of new possibilities. I partitioned the power of
the Ten Tails inside of me, and named each of the pieces… And believed that the bond known
as "cooperation" was true power. I then named
the younger brother, Ashura, the leader and guardian
of the Ninja Creed, believing that his elder brother, Indra,
would cooperate with his younger brother. However… Indra did not accept my decision. And thus from that day on, …interminable conflict began. Even after their flesh perished,
the chakra the two honed continued to reincarnate across time, without vanishing…
over and over. It kind of sounds like being
haunted by a ghost. It's creepy. So, is it still possessing
someone even know? It's you, Naruto. The younger brother Ashura has
reincarnated as you. If all chakra were to
be reunited into one again,

 a new Chakra Fruit
would take shape.

 That must be prevented
at all costs,

 or this world would come
to an end.

 I would like you to stop Madara.

 In your unpredictability,
I feel the possibility exists.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Sage of Six Paths."

 Thanks for believing in us.

 THE SAGE OF THE SIX PATHS

 Tune in again!

 The younger brother, Ashura,
has been reincarnated in you. My eyes can clearly see
Ashura's chakra clinging about you. I wonder if… You don't seem too surprised. Perhaps, you have sensed
Ashura's presence inside you already? I thought as much.
Then you must know already… who is the reincarnate
of the older one, Indra… Sasuke… Sasuke did that? Yes, it's an unbelievable situation. That's why I want you
to let me handle Sasuke. You want to take on
Sasuke alone? How can you expect us
to agree to that? Tenten is right, Naruto. We can't just give in
to your stubbornness. The reason is… this is a big problem
for the village. I'm not being stubborn. You said you'd give us
the details when we got home, but I never thought
this is what you'd say! We've all made up our minds
to kill Sasuke! Hey, Naruto, I hope you're not saying
you'll get Sasuke all by yourself, when you're actually planning
to protect him. No, I have no intention
of protecting Sasuke. After all the fighting
at the Five Kage Summit, and fighting Danzo… If Sasuke was so weakened
at that time, why didn't you take him out
right then? Madara was there too! It didn't seem like it would
be an easy task. Besides… That's no reason to let him
get away so easily! Hey, Naruto…
You're strong. You're the hero who took
down Pain, aren't you?! Hero? Yeah. You could take Sasuke down
like you did back then. That's not true. I wouldn't be able to beat Sasuke
with something like that now. That's what I found out. Inside him too, is… Isn't that right? The Sage of Six Paths

 The older brother, Indra,
has been reincarnated in you. My eyes can clearly see
Indra's chakra clinging about you. You don't seem too surprised. Perhaps, you have sensed
Indra's presence inside you already? I thought as much.
Then you must know already… who is the reincarnate
of the younger one, Ashura… Naruto… Isn't that right? Yes. You sensed it, after all. It seems that there were
other reincarnates besides Sasuke and me… Who were the others? The first generation of reincarnates
were Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha. Hashirama was Ashura.
Madara was Indra. You know how they ended up. However, before Madara could end
his life as a reincarnate, he created a certain problem. Madara was so obsessed with power
that he stole some of Hashirama's. Which, in short,
caused the merging of a portion of Ashura's chakra
with Indra's chakra… And the result was that
it became essentially, my own chakra. That's right,
he awakened the Rinnegan. I always thought that someone
like that would appear among either Indra
or his reincarnates. Hence, I left behind
the stone tablet that contained my writings
on how to deal with this. Although, it seems no one could
understand its meaning… So, Super Sage Gramps, you've been watching your kids' sibling rivalry
all this time? Yes, I suppose you could say that. I see… Through Ninshu, I preached that chakra is the power
that links individuals. I strongly believe that chakra
should not be something that amplifies the strength
of one person alone. Even after my mother, Kaguya,
put an end to chaotic times, she ruled with her power alone. However, my mother's power
bred arrogance within her. And mankind began to dread
the existence of that power. That is why my mother,
once known as the Rabbit Goddess, became feared as a demon. When power is concentrated
in one person, that power runs rampant and
in time, it possesses the person. The current Madara is
a prime example of that… He's become just like
my mother, Kaguya. Now, he's no longer
Indra's incarnate. He's obtained Ten Tails' power
and is getting close to me. And he is trying to obtain even
my mother Kaguya's power. The Infinite Tsukuyomi doesn't
just cast genjutsu over you. It keeps you trapped
inside genjutsu dreams, so that the caster can use your
individual power while keeping you alive. You're attached to the roots
of the Divine Tree, and turned into living slaves. Mother possessed the power
of Sharingan as well as Byakugan. She used her Visual Prowess to cast
that jutsu upon the populace. It was a ghastly jutsu. If all chakra were to
be reunited into one again, a new Chakra Fruit
would take shape. That must be prevented
at all costs… or this world will end. I would like you to stop Madara. Unlike the previous reincarnates,
you tend to be a little bit of a fool. But there may be potential
in your unpredictability. Even long after you died,
you tried to protect the world… And even when
it's turned out like this, you still have faith in us.
Thank you. Don't thank me.
I don't deserve it. If the current world desires Indra's,
or rather, my mother's way… and if that's the natural flow… then I'm the one who's selfishly
trying to go against it and stop it. Even in terms of how
the Tailed Beasts are being used, not for maintaining peace and balance,
but only as weapons… Perhaps my way is naïve. No! You're not wrong, Super Gramps! You're absolutely right, old man! Oh, aren't you Gaara's? Why are you inside of me? You see, Obito… Octopops! He extracted a portion of Shukaku's
and my chakra from Madara. He knew exactly which Tailed Beast
powers you were lacking, that guy! Obito did that? A lot of things happened. He even put me inside of you. Now you've got the chakra of all
nine Tailed Beasts within you, Naruto! Even you?
The other half of Kurama? The promised time has
finally come, old man Six Paths! You're right, my dear Kurama… Just as Gamamaru prophesied… a blue-eyed youth who can name all
nine beasts and frolic among them. Prophesied? You mean the prophecy
Giant Gramps Sage passed on to the Pervy Sage? Gamamaru is his real name? You're pretty awesome because
you know that, Super Gramps! Hey, Naruto! You truly have the ability
to win other's cooperation. You managed to summon my soul. And accepted that Ashura has
reincarnated inside of you. Shukaku. Matatabi. Isobu. Son Goku. Kokuo. Saiken. Chomei. Gyuki. Kurama. It seems the time has come… for the child of prophecy
to change the world. My dear Naruto… What do you want to do? What do you seek for
the aftermath of this war? I would like to hear
your honest thoughts and opinions. Maybe I'm really like
this Ashura guy. Only…unlike him,
I'm just a stupid kid who doesn't know much
about a lot of things. But, I do know what friends are. And I want to protect them all. That's it. Is that your answer? Yeah… Long ago, I entrusted
everything to Ashura and cast my attention away
from Indra. That proved to be
the source of calamity. Put out your dominant arm. This time, I am also entrusting
my power to you, Indra's reincarnate. From this point on,
Naruto and Sasuke… What you both shall do,
and what shall transpire, will be up to the two of you. Naruto and I… Sasuke and I… …may not be real brothers, but I really believe that
we can make peace. Because we're pretty good friends. Now then… Hey, Kabuto! Sasuke's… Sasuke's going
to be okay, right? Hey, say something, you—! Obito! Is Naruto all right? Naruto the Jinchuriki will die if
his Tailed Beast is extracted… But I put the Tailed Beast
back inside him. He should be okay now. Sasuke! Naruto! – Time to go.
– Time to go. You're the first since Hashirama
to make me feel this excited! Can you still dance? Do you have any other techniques? Give me some more fun! This guy…even after
a barrage of Sekizo…! Guy Sensei! Even that…didn't work… Sekizo…isn't enough! This is great! Keep on dancing! All that's left…is Night Guy! Given the state of
his heart's Chakra Point, this will be his final attack… Charge! That stance is not the Sekizo! Don't tell me he has something
even greater! Guy! Come on, Dad, hurry! There's no need to rush. The Academy isn't going
to run away, is it? There's a set time for
entrance applications. Oh, nice to meet you! My son will be attending
the Academy. Dad… I hope those two
will get along okay. I'm afraid that will
be impossible! Huh? What a thing to say! Are you one of
those monster parents?! No, Dad… You're wrong. He failed the Academy
entrance exam. Oh, pardon me! I just assumed
since you were in front of the Academy. Don't worry about it! Uh, I don't think it's anything
to be laughing about. Hey, Kakashi, don't be rude. But Dad, you were a lot ruder
just a minute ago. I mean, this guy is trying
to get in to the Academy even though he can't
use ninjutsu. Oops, we should get going,
or we're going to be late. Right. Excuse me. Your name's Kakashi Hatake, right? Thank you for your support! Kakashi… Don't slack off just because
you got into the Academy. At the rate he's training, that boy will become
stronger than you. He will? They haven't announced
the alternates yet, have they? The Academy isn't dumb. You should ask what his name is
and remember it. What…? He'll be a good rival for you. Hey, you! What's your name? Might Guy! I'm going to become stronger
than anyone around! You actually had perfect timing
for once… Are you all right, Kakashi?! Dad, it ended up exactly
as you predicted. Guy! I'll acknowledge
this chakra of yours! Of all those who have
fought me over the years, there's no one
who surpasses you at taijutsu! I, Madara, declare you the strongest! Flow! He's fast! What?!
He's bending space? Night Guy! Guy Sensei? That was Guy's final move! What happened? I almost died, you bastard! Your flame is about to go out… But in gratitude for
such a great time, I'll finish you off… before you turn to ash
on your own! He kicked away my Truthseeker Orb?! Bushier Brow Sensei… Naruto…? You seem a little different
from before. What did Obito do? Yeah… I'm still trying to figure it out myself. But I think I can change
everything now! I know I just came back,
but the next episode's an extra!

 It's been three years since
I was back in the village,

 and Konohamaru's pestering me
to teach him a new jutsu!

 I guess I have no choice!

 Well, I'll just have to teach him
one amazing jutsu!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Ones Who Will Inherit"

 Konohamaru, just GAAH it
and BAM it!

 THE ONES WHO WILL INHERIT


 Tune in again!
 
 There, all done! Everything is all nice and shiny! Wow, you cleaned Naruto's room. That's right.
Naruto's been away for three years. Everything is spotless and
ready to welcome him home! Naruto? Is that you, Naruto?! Long time no see… Sakura. Big Brother Naruto! Sexy Jutsu! Well? Not too bad in
the curves department, huh? Konohamaru, I'm not a kid anymore… And you shouldn't be doing
that kind of jutsu either… That jutsu is weak. Now watch my new Pervy Ninjutsu
that I just developed! You idiot! Haven't you matured at all inside,
have you? The Ones Who Will Inherit

 Oh man, I thought you'd be
a little impressed.

 Well, my training involved
way more awesome jutsu. Just as I anticipated from you! It's all going according to plan! Plan? What happened here?! As you can see, I cleaned
your house until it sparkled. Konohamaru,
you're such a great guy! Yup! And I don't even
expect you to teach me a new jutsu in return either! I have absolutely
no ulterior motives! You are so obvious. All right then. I'm gonna
teach you an amazing jutsu. All right! First, let me put my things way. Isn't that the outfit
you used to wear? Yeah, it doesn't fit anymore. But I just can't part with it… So in other words,
it's your treasure! It's sort of embarrassing
when you put it that way… What I'm going to teach you
isn't your run-of-the-mill jutsu. Just what kind of Pervy Ninjutsu
is it going to be? Just hurry up and show me! The first step is rotation. Whoa! We're going to
add motion, eh?! Next up is power. Attack with the risqué, eh?! And then finally, there's… There's more! Containment! The most points go to
the best-expressed final pose, eh?! What are you talking about? I mean,
it's a Pervy Ninjutsu, right? It's more awesome than that. The jutsu I'm about to teach you
is A-rank in it's degree of difficulty
to master. An ultimate ninjutsu that hones chakra rotation,
power and containment… It's called the Rasengan! Awesome! But I don't understand
what's going on at all! Don't worry about that,
because I'm gonna teach you. Besides, you can do this jutsu
even if you're stupid! No kidding! Huh? Stupid? This training consists
of three steps, total. First step, the water balloon. A water balloon? You have to GAAAH it,
then BAM it, to burst it! Wow! So… How did you do that?! I just explained it. You have to GAAAH it,
then BAM it, to burst it! I said… You have to GAAAH it, then BAM it! Simple, right?! Okay, do your best, Konohamaru. What? That's it? You're already leaving?! I have to train with Sakura now. But! Don't be a baby, Konohamaru. In anything you do, you've got to
learn by doing and feeling. Besides…I have absolute faith…
that you can do it! Big Brother Naruto… All right… I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna surprise you
the next time you see me! GAAAH then BAM! GAAAH then BAM! GAAAH then BAM! GAAAH then BAM!
GAAAH then BAM! GAAAH then BAM! Th-There's an emergency,
Lady Fifth! What's all the fuss about? We've just gotten word that
the Hidden Sand's Kazekage has been abducted by an organization
known as the Akatsuki. Gaara was—?! Team Kakashi,
I'm assigning you a new mission. You're to go to
the Sand Village at once, find out what's going on there,
and keep us informed. You're to remain there
and follow their orders. Give them any backup they need. Right! GAAAH then BAM! The inside is rotating, but… Oh, there he is!
Konohamaru! What's going on? It's terrible! Some guys called the Akatsuki kidnapped the Kazekage
of the Hidden Sand! The Kazekage?
Isn't he Big Bro's friend? Yeah… Naruto just left as part of
the Hidden Leaf support team! Huh?! Awesome, eh? The minute he gets back, he gets picked for no less than
an S-rank mission! Even though he's
a genin just like us! I can't figure it out
with just GAAAH and BAM! Hey! What are you doing,
Konohamaru? How long have you guys
been watching?! So that's the reason
for those weird yells. Don't call them weird! Even I was a bit embarrassed… I mean what does
GAAAH and BAM mean anyway? Why don't you try
distancing yourself a bit? What do you mean? Well, Naruto does things
intuitively, by feeling. Not everyone's like that. Yeah… Isn't there something else
you can do? Well… The first step is rotation… He said I have to learn it
through feeling. That's it. Konohamaru! Let's practice that first! O-Okay! Anyway, that's how it is.
So please help! I don't really get it… But are you sure about this? Yes, please! It's absolutely necessary
for the new jutsu. All right! I got it! You sold me with
your determination. Come on! Fang Over Fang! Well, Konohamaru? Well… Everything just… Okay, then… On to the next thing! Please help! Well, if that's the case… Come on! Human Boulder! All right! Next! Okay, Konohamaru! Go! Hold on a minute! But Hinata! This is for Konohamaru! It's not that. I can't use rotation. Then… I understand. Understand what? 8 Trigrams Air Palm! This doesn't make sense! Idiot…idiot… KIBA INUZUKA
CHOJI AKIMICHI
HINATA HYUGA
 Next up… Wait! I can't keep doing this! You're right. Did you figure out something? No. Nothing. Did Big Bro Naruto
tell you anything else? He said he taught me everything
that was necessary. But all he taught me
was the Sexy Jutsu… Wait a minute… What is it? He dissed my Sexy Jutsu
and said it was weak. So maybe… If I heat up the sexiness,
it will connect nicely! That's gotta be it, Konohamaru! I wonder about that… The problem is…
how do you make it sexier? The one who holds the key…
is that man! So anyway, that's how it is. I see…
so you're practicing a new jutsu… But I've hit a wall… And in order to get over it,
I need your help, Sensei. It's so unlike Konohamaru
to be so determined… Well, I have no choice
but to do my best to help him! I'll be happy to help you! So, what do you want to know? Sexiness! I want you to teach me
all about sexiness! I see, all about sexiness… Wh-What? D-Did you say sexiness?! Big Bro Naruto used to say… If Old Man Jiraiya was
the all-out open pervert… You're the closet pervert,
Ebisu Sensei! Naruto…and his big mouth! You're the only one
I can turn to, Sensei! I need that secret side of you,
Sensei! But… We found it, Konohamaru! The secret textbook! Nooo! There's one here too! Nooo! Here too! Oh, and over here! Wow, so many… Talk about a secret fortress! There are stacks of textbooks
in the attic! We gotta look under
the floorboards too! Thank you, Ebisu Sensei! This is way more than
we ever imagined! Now you can continue your training! Huh?! That look… In the eyes of an innocent girl…
The feeling she expressed was… …contempt. Awesome! Look at how many
different kinds there are! Closet perverts don't fool around,
do they? I think I'm starting to see Sensei
in a different light… The problem now is, that there are
too many to choose from. How about this one? Well, the rotation is there… All right, here goes! You're really bad at that. Th-The real jutsu happens now! Here we go! No! This time I'll get it! Idiot…idiot! H-How's this?! This time, it's for real! Just now,
something just went BLOOP. Yeah, it was different
from the other times! That's right,
when Big Bro Naruto shattered it… The surface went BLOOP
like just now. Then try it again
with more finesse! Okay! I'm gonna do this! How was that?! You did it, Konohamaru. It's sorta different, but… Okay, on to step two! It was worth it,
training hard while while you were away at
the Hidden Sand Village, Big Bro! Okay, this is the next step
in training. For the second step… Use this! A rubber ball? Exactly. And you… …have to GUUUH it,
then DOOON it, and burst it! – That's all!
– Not that again! I had a hunch… But that's it for
step two as well?! Don't say that, Konohamaru.
This jutsu… …has to be learned by doing…right? See, you know what to do. I really wish I could supervise
your training a little… You just got back and
you're off on another mission?! We learned from this last mission that Orochimaru had a spy
imbedded with Sasori. Orochimaru?! That means… If things go well,
we may find a clue about Sasuke. We're gonna lure the spy out
and make him talk! He's so casual about it, but this mission has to be
an A-rank or higher… Big Bro really is amazing. I'm talented and
I don't need your help, Big Bro! Good luck on your mission! Right! I'm going to get better too! I'm gonna do it! It's really hard, isn't it? The only thing
you got right is power… The rubber ball is much harder and since there's no water inside,
I can't grasp the feeling of it. So what'll we refer to next? I'm positive this one's better! No, it's this one for sure! My mom says guys have
a weakness for extremes like this! It's gotta be this for power! I think this person looks strong. We can't seem to agree on this one. I see… So you lost some respect
due to some occurrence… Yes… And I don't know
what to do now… It's okay… Everyone makes mistakes. There are always opportunities
to make it up. Iruka Sensei… So for now, let's just calmly support
Konohamaru and his progress. There you are! I've been looking for you! Perfect timing.
We were just talking about you. There's something
you have to teach us, Ebisu Sensei! Me? Isn't this wonderful Ebisu Sensei? You now have an opportunity
to regain their trust. You guys! Don't tell me! I won't hold back… Which girl… …is number one. Please tell us! W-What?! D-Doing that in public! I will not tolerate
such immoral behavior! What in the world
are you fools doing?! But… To master my new jutsu,
I had to make it way sexier… Is that true, Ebisu Sensei? I don't know. But a jutsu is
a ninja's secret weapon! It's not something
you activate recklessly, not even a Sexy Jutsu! You keep it hidden until
the very last minute, and then release it… That's how you get
the maximum result you desire! Keep it hidden until
the very last minute, and then release it? Ebisu Sensei! What's the matter? Is this what you mean? Huh? Hide it, GUUUUH it, then… That definitely looked powerful! Awesome! Leave it to Ebisu Sensei
the closet perv! I can do it! Hide it GUUUUH it, then… BAM! It expanded instantly that time! That had an effect! But it still didn't burst! Big Bro Naruto is
so far ahead of me. Even now,
he's trying to progress. And I must too! Ouch! Are you okay, Konohamaru?! This is bad. Your hand is a mess
from all that compressed chakra… I'll take care of it right now. It was bound to
take its toll on you… You've been training
for days on end. Damn it! I wasn't strong enough
to bring him back.

 This time, I'll surpass Sasuke
with my Wind Chakra!

 As expected, you're so cool Naruto!

 That's why you're my rival!

 And what about you, Konohamaru?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto's Rival."

 Here I go!


 Hold it in, GUUUH it, and…


 BAM!


 NARUTO'S RIVAL


 Tune in again!

 Naruto's Rival

 This is so annoying.

 Orochimaru gets away when
he was almost within our grasp; the Akatsuki's movements
are as suspicious as ever… There's been no good news
at all lately. Isn't there anything fun going on? Well… Oh, Konohamaru came to
the hospital yesterday. What's fun about that? His fists were terribly bruised
from his own chakra. It seems Naruto is teaching him
the Rasengan. Oh… That's interesting. What's your pick? Huh? Will he master it? Or not? Lady Tsunade! Come on… It's just a diversion. Hold it in, GUUUH it, and… BAM! – That's it!
– That's it! I-I did it! All right! I did it! That was awesome, Konohamaru. I can't just stand around here. We have to find Big Bro Naruto! Speaking of Naruto… We haven't seen him around lately. Oh, I heard he just returned
a little bit ago. I overheard… His last mission didn't go well. Huh? Really? If that's true… We shouldn't bother him now. Konohamaru. No worries! I know Big Bro Naruto!
He's not like that. Kakashi Sensei,
have you seen Naruto? Oh, he's over there. Hey, you guys! You were right.
He's more cheerful than I expected. See! I told you so! Sorry I didn't come around.
Lots of things happened… I heard. You weren't able to catch the spy. Yeah. Turned out, there was
something bigger lying in wait. Are you talking about Orochimaru?! We found one of their hideouts,
and we also found Sasuke. But… I wasn't strong enough
to bring him back. So, I have no choice
but to get stronger, right? That's why you're training? Yeah. I'm just about to move on
to the next step. This time… I'll surpass Sasuke
with my Wind Chakra! Awesome! As expected, you're so cool Naruto! That's why you're my rival! And what about you, Konohamaru?
How're you doing? Well, just watch me! Here I go! Hold it in, GUUUH it, and… BAM! S-Sir, what in the world going on?! Hmm…I wonder… How was that?! Uh…yeah…
You did well… I sense doubt in your voice! Hey, I did it properly. Yeah, you did, but… Why are you using a Sexy Jutsu? I'm just honoring
what you taught me… and keeping it at
the utmost sexiness that I can. What else?! Sexiness? The sensation of rotating chakra
can only be learned with your body… And I already showed you
the importance of perseverance… …and stuff like that, right? I didn't understand one little bit!
Tell me in easy words! Now I feel like I polished
an unnecessary skill! Now, now… Everything turned out okay. Anyways, can I go on to
the next step in training? Yes! It's the final leg from here on…
For the third step… Use this. Wait a minute. What now?
Just listen! I can't do Shadow Clones… Damn it… Okay then,
we'll do Shadow Clones first. Watch closely… With Shadow Clones, you go DOWAAH with your body… …like so! Okay? Think you can do it? Not again.
So that's the entire explanation… You have to master this in order to
go on with the training. Do your best, Konohamaru! I wouldn't take it easy
if I were you, Bro. What do you mean? We're both rivals,
working on a new jutsu. So who's gonna master it first? I challenge you! How fun.
I accept your challenge! Okay then… Let's go, Moegi, Udon! All right! I'm not gonna lose! Go for it, Konohamaru! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I couldn't do it. I need more chakra… Hah! Okay, next one! Let's go! Hah! All right! What is this? Oh, octopus tentacles? How about calling it a day? Not yet! I just need a little break. – Konohamaru…
– Konohamaru… Konohamaru… He fell asleep. Coming! Oh, what's up? We heard that you were making
food pills for Big Bro Naruto… Please! Can you teach us the recipe? Sure. All right! I was just making some. If you help, you can have some. – Yes!
– Yes! Okay, I need you to
mash up this and this. – Okay!
– Okay! I hear Konohamaru is training hard. Yes… He wants to beat Big Bro Naruto. He's really working hard. Almost too hard. Then he'll probably stay out there…
Naruto's not going home either. It's no wonder you want to help. Uh-huh! But… But… At the same time,
it makes me uneasy… Maybe more like anxious… Konohamaru is
chasing after Naruto… and he's getting farther
and farther away from us. You're afraid of being left behind? – Huh?
– Huh? I was like that
when I was your age. I really wanted to catch up. That's why I became
Lady Tsunade's apprentice. I'm sure you'll find it too…
Your goals, your mentors… And your rivals. – Uh-huh!
– Uh-huh! So gross! Don't give up, Konohamaru! Suck it up! All right! Here I go! All right! I did it! – Yay!
– Yay! Congratulations, Konohamaru! You made it! – Yay!
– Yay! Huh?
It disappeared?! You're still having a hard time
sustaining them. Big Bro Naruto! Don't tell me you—?! Too bad, Konohamaru. I win this time. No way!
I was almost there! I won't lose next time! I swear, you'll be so surprised,
you'll be speechless! Okay do your best… Anyway, I'm moving on
to my next training. I see… Contact those involved immediately. Damn Akatsuki… I saw it… Whoa! I saw what Big Bro Naruto
is training for. He's working on an awesome jutsu
that'll be his alone! Are you serious?! You're here… Konohamaru. Huh? Asuma Sarutobi is… Asuma… Uncle Asuma… I see…Big Brother Naruto
has already decided… But… But I… Hey, where are you going? I'm going to train. Konohamaru… If you're thinking about revenge… I know! I know it's impossible
for me right now. But Big Bro Naruto
intends on going. He'll probably perfect… …his new jutsu in time. – Wait up!
– Wait up! I've got to catch up
to Big Bro! Thank you for coming! Thank you, it was delicious! You're finally getting
the hang of Shadow Clones. Let's go, Big Bro Naruto! Sexy Onnanoko Tachi Jutsu! Oh! So that's what you've got! I wasn't expecting a love triangle. See! The sexiness paid off! Hey Bro,
don't rest on your laurels, eh? Maybe not. But I'm still in the lead! And I won't lose! Are you ready? We'll start
step three of the Rasengan! Okay! Why're they making
Shadow Clones? Rasengan is supposed to be
released by one person. Well, Naruto is the teacher… Still, aren't you happy,
Lady Tsunade? Huh? It seems you were right to
bet on him not mastering it. U-Uh-huh. Don't judge people arbitrarily. The Rasengan is a damn hard jutsu. Well, Lord Fourth
invented it after all. And it was passed down to Jiraiya, then Naruto and now,
to Konohamaru. Life is worth living, after all. And where will it take us next? I hope we'll be around
to see it through! The next generation, huh? The passing of time
is interesting, isn't it? You didn't forget anything,
did you? You won't be coming home
for a while. Don't worry. I'm packed and ready… Hey, stop it! Big Bro Naruto! Hey, Konohamaru!
Did you come to see me off? I have a complaint! How can you leave
on a training journey before I've mastered the Rasengan?! It's your fault for dawdling. Okay then! I'll have it under my belt
by the time you get back and I'll be real strong! And I'm gonna be strong too! By the way, I have a favor to ask. What is it? It's going to be a long journey, so I want to entrust that thing
to you while I'm gone. You mean your treasure, Big Bro?! Shhh!! How long are you going to
stand around and talk?! Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm counting on you, Konohamaru. You got it! Found it! Now, I'll take this home and… No… I might as well… I wonder how Big Bro is doing now. He's probably training
with all his Shadow Clones. Yeah, Big Bro has that option. I have to hurry and
perfect my Rasengan too. What was that? The village is under attack… Udon! Moegi! We have to return to
the village now! Everyone!
Hurry to the evacuation shelter! You sure went at it, didn't you? I will not forgive
a lowlife like you! Ebisu Sensei! Get away now, Konohamaru! Big Bro Naruto… We're rivals now! One day, I'll duel with you
for the title of Hokage… So look forward to that day,
Konohamaru! Die… Long ago I made a promise. So I won't take the easy way out! Because Big Bro Naruto won't be
waiting at the end of that road! I bear the name of
the exalted Sarutobi Clan! I am the genin known as
Konohamaru Sarutobi! Remember me! We did it!
We did it! I heard, Konohamaru.
You took down one of the Pains! I wasn't determined to catch up
to you just for fun, you know! But that was nothing compared to
how you saved the entire village. That's not true. Besides, there were
many things I couldn't protect. Big Bro Naruto… There's something
I want to show you! Hey! Where are you going? Just follow me! Here! Why'd you bring me to
the evacuation shelter? We're going just up further! The valuables warehouse? And…
this is my family's storage space. Tadah! This… …it's my jacket… It's a precious treasure. So I brought it here just in case. I kept my promise! Konohamaru… You're a great kid! I know! One day, I'm gonna challenge you
for the Hokage's seat! So, from now on,
consider me your rival! All right! I can feel it clearly,
even from here.

 The other half of
Super Gramps' power.

 You cannot take me down.
I am essentially immortal now.

 I have obtained eternity.

 You idiot.

 I ain't taking you down.
We will take you down.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"To Rise Up."


 Your time has come, Madara.


 TO RISE UP


 Tune in again!

 Guy Sensei! That was Guy's final move! What happened? I almost died, you bastard! Your flame is about to go out. But in gratitude for
such a great time, I'll finish you off before you turn
to ash on your own! He kicked away
my Truthseeker Orb?! Bushier Brow Sensei… Naruto… You seem a little different
from before. What did Obito do? Yeah… I'm still trying
to figure it out myself. But I think I can change
everything now! To Rise Up
 
 That node's chakra hasn't gone out. What's going on?
What did he do? Don't tell me he stopped
the end result of the Eight Gates?! He touched the Truthseeker Orb,
so how can he—? Is it because
I haven't finished healing yet? No! His power is suddenly growing?! Son! Lend me some of your chakra, okay? All right! Sage Art: Lava Style Rasen Shuriken! Th-This is bad! Limbo! What?! He dodged…my Limbo?! All right! Burst! The tree's been severed! Take me within you. Who is that?! Take the Divine Tree… Ten Tails… …everything, into you. Did Naruto do it? Guy Sensei is over there too! The tree disappeared! Guy Sensei! Bushier Brow Sensei
is gonna be okay! He's not gonna die! Naruto, you healed him? But I thought he had activated
all Eight Gates… I feel like I can
do all sorts of things… the way I am right now! He touched Madara's rods,
but he wasn't affected… What happened to him
while he was dying? Can you teleport, Lord Second? I see… Yeah… Since I'm linked to
the Fourth's markings. But unfortunately… At my current strength,
I can only teleport one person. That's plenty. I alone need to go. Sasuke! His wind…
has gotten even stronger. Sasuke… I wanted to see where
your wind would take you… But I've witnessed enough. In fact, from now on,
we'll only be a burden to you. So we're not gonna be ordered
around anymore. That sounds good to me too. Sasuke… Hey… Why are you trying
to give up, guys? I… I… Bushy Brow and Gaara,
take care of Bushier Brow Sensei. Naruto… Thank you for…Guy Sensei… Naruto… When you become Hokage,
let's have a drink together. You got it! Is that Naruto?! Obito… You… You're an enemy. You hurt and killed
many of my comrades… I don't want to say this, but… I'm going to consider you
an ally just this once. Thank you for saving Naruto. I have one final favor to ask you. Not as an ally, but as an enemy… I understand now… The Divine Tree itself… The time has come
for all to become one. Is it because
I met Super Gramps Sage and got more power from him? I can feel it clearly even
from here… The other half of
Super Gramps' power. You cannot take me down. Essentially, I am completely immortal now. I have obtained eternity! You idiot! I'm not taking you down… We're gonna take you down! Your time has come, Madara. One has awakened
the Six Paths' Senjutsu… and the other awakened
the Rinnegan, huh? However…I possess
both of those powers! This is the final battle! My powers versus yours… Let's settle who is superior,
once and for all! Sage Art:
Shadow Style Thunder Blast! Sasuke's gone?! This left eye… So that's what it can do… Teleportation? This distance? No, he didn't teleport! You should pay attention! Limbo! What is that?! He did it again! Sage Art! Gale Style: Fang of Light! It's coming again! Over there! It didn't hit. Sasuke, it's headed your way! Something I can't see is
ambling around you. Oh yeah? I can see it clearly! These guys can see my Limbo… It's…another Madara. So he can see it with his Rinnegan… And that one,
can't see it but senses it… Naruto! Looks like our physical attacks… have no effect on
the other Madara. Yeah! Normally, one shouldn't be able to
sense or see it from this realm… That "me" exists in
the invisible world of "Limbo." How did they both obtain
such power so suddenly? That Sasuke Uchiha… He was the only one who
awakened the straight pattern, Choku-Tomoe Sharingan
just like mine. Perhaps Sasuke and I share
a bond that goes beyond blood. Well then… That left eye should suit me perfectly! So, that's your left eye's
ability as well. Then try it. That's not enough to kill you, is it? So the Six Paths' Sage Chakra
can affect the shadow Madara too, huh? That wound on his right arm… is from blocking
Naruto's first attack earlier. It seems your shadow
returns to your body after a certain amount of time. Naruto, when his shadow
emerges again, go after it. I'll take on the visible one. However… I used to hate it when
you would order me around… Some things never change, huh? Let me finish. This is our chance. Madara and his shadow
will probably stay merged for a little while longer. I don't care what it is, but get a Sage Power Jutsu ready. One that seals movement. Then you should use my chakra
to build your Sealing Jutsu. Thanks…ummm… It's Shukaku! He's estimating the Limbo's duration, activation interval
and how to counter it… He's got a sharp intuition, calm analyzing and
judgment skills, and a Choku-Tomoe Sharingan
just like mine. If he had only been born
before Obito… he would be my… No… There's no point
in reflecting now. No matter what's happened, I must keep in mind that
these two aren't ordinary brats. I need to get
my other eye back soon. Sage Art: Magnet Style Rasengan! And I have Six Paths Power too… Chidori! Naruto, shoot that towards me! I'll take care of the rest. It's a bit irritating,
but there's no time to argue! Why am I here? Naruto, the jutsu the Sage of
Six Paths gave you… You know it, right? Yeah, the time is now! What? He moved? He substituted his shadow? Over there! Sasuke, I'll hold this one down,
so go after the real one! Seems like his Rinnegan
can't reach this distance. I'm starting to understand
your left eye's abilities, Sasuke. Hurry, Sasuke! Madara is heading straight for… Kakashi Sensei! Hurry and destroy my Rinnegan… I can't hold off Black Zetsu any longer. I must admit Sasuke sure is fast. Kamui! Damn! Just his upper body, huh? Hurry! I know! Oh no, you don't! The Rinnegan will fall
into Madara's hands.

 If he ends up with both eyes,
terrible things will happen.

 Terrible things?
How much worse can it get?

 If both Rinnegan are restored
to their true owner…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Infinite Dream"

 …I fear no one will be able
to stand against him.


 THE INFINITE DREAM


 Tune in again!

 Now, hurry! Oh no, you don't! Kamui! The Infinite Dream

 Sakura! Kakashi Sensei. Sasuke?! Why did you pop up here, Sakura? She was in the Time-Space plane… Sakura, what's going on
over there? Kakashi Sensei, your left eye! It all happened so quickly. But I think Madara stole my Sharingan. Let me take a look, Sensei! Thanks. In any case, what happened to Obito? I'm sure Madara used the Kamui
to teleport himself there! In a flash,
I was back out here, so… Madara… I want you to destroy my left eye, the one that has the Rinnegan. I can't even move now… If I let down my guard,
even just a little bit… Black Zetsu will take over my body,
Rinnegan and all. Then he'll use my right eye's
Visual Prowess to get back outside… …and the Rinnegan will fall
into Madara's hands. If he ends up with both eyes,
terrible things will happen. Terrible things? How much worse can it get?
Hasn't he done enough? I wasn't able to implant
both Rinnegan myself. Even with just this left eye, its chakra and Visual Prowess
are so strong that I started losing myself. I'm not even its original owner, yet I was able to accomplish
this much with just one. If both Rinnegan are restored
to their true owner, I fear no one will be able
to stand against him… But that's—! With Visual Prowess,
only with both eyes together can their full power be unleashed. We can't waste any time.
Please destroy this left eye! What's wrong, Sakura?! We're in trouble! Obito had reached his limit
and couldn't move… Which means Madara's going
to get Obito's Rinnegan! The Cursed Seal Tag I placed on
your heart has disappeared. How did you remove it? You shouldn't have been able
to damage it yourself. I had Kakashi stab me
and remove it. This is all I can do right now. Since it was in the way
of me making myself into the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki… I gambled my life on it… But I wasn't going to keep
doing what you wanted! Actually, you did exactly
what I wanted you to do. In fact, you exceeded my hopes. What's so funny? A Curse Seal Tag meant to
turn you into a puppet… One that would restrict your movements, should you try to remove it from
inside the body it's implanted in. It seems you knew about it, Obito. Regarding these Cursed Tags
I implanted in the two of you… Naturally, you couldn't have
killed yourselves either. Since you both were
my precious pawns. "You both"…? As fate would have it… It's ironic that both of
you ended up getting rid of them through
the exact same method. Rin! Yes. That plot to make that girl
into the Three Tails' Jinchuriki and have her rampage through
the Leaf Village was mine. Not the Hidden Mist's! That girl took advantage of
Kakashi's attack against the enemy to avert the plot,
at the cost of her life. But that was also part
of my plan… In order to pitch you
into darkness and make you into my pawn. You bastard, you deliberately
had me see all that! I waited for the opportunity, when Minato was away
on another mission. And manipulated the Mist Shinobi
into kidnapping Rin, leaving Kakashi
so he would come after her. The other purpose of that was so I could see the extent
of your unleashed power. Did you really think that
White Zetsu goading you on, and you being able to get out
from underground right at that moment was all a big coincidence? I was just outside! Your friends Rin and
stupid Kakashi are in trouble! What happened?! They're alone and
completely surrounded by Hidden Mist Shinobi! How are Rin and Kakashi
doing right now? According to the others,
it looks pretty bad. They're talking about some
Hidden Mist test subjects… but I don't really understand. Test subjects? Anyway, it seems Rin and
Kakashi are totally surrounded. And they're saying they all appear to be jonin or Black Ops. What's Minato Sensei doing? Who is that? I'm asking you what
the Yellow Flash is doing! Seems he's on a different mission. At a time like this?! That the girl dying
by Kakashi's hand was more than I could
have hoped for. Either way, I would have had
my Puppet Shinobi kill her. I taught you to use the darkness
in people's hearts… to manipulate them, didn't I, Obito? If there isn't any darkness,
you can create some. Don't you think it's presumptuous
to consider yourself any different? Why? Why me?! You were kind and cared about
people from the bottom of your heart. Remember how great you were
at taking care of the elderly? Your deep love for Rin…
for your comrades and friends… for the Hokage and
all other shinobi… Once you fell into darkness,
it would conversely transform into an equally profound
hatred for this world. That's the kind of guy you are. For my plan to work completely, I just need one more thing… I'll be taking back that left eye. This should do it! You can't move anymore. I'm leaving him to you! Right! You can count on me! It seems Madara appeared there. I see… So that's what Obito said. We don't know when Madara
might emerge. Stay alert. What about his shadow? I stopped him cold with my Shadow Clones and
Six Paths' Rods! Naruto? Hey, Sakura… Let me do it! What are you trying to do, Naruto? Hey! It's okay, it's okay. Kakashi Sensei,
try opening your eye. No way! How did you do that? It's really hard to explain in words… But I took a part of Kakashi Sensei, and then I kinda…um…uhh… Hey, Naruto…
I told everyone to stay alert! What? But it's the first time
I'm hearing of it! Quit talking back
for once, Naruto! Anyway, you'll have to explain
about the eye later! Madara stole Kakashi's eye
and went to where Obito is. The next time he appears,
he'll have both Rinnegan! What? Really? Let's see, we'll start
with the introductions. I'll go! I'll go! I'm Naruto Uzumaki! I love instant cup ramen. But I really love
the ramen at Ichiraku that Iruka Sensei treats me to
even more! I hate having to
wait three minutes after pouring the hot water
into the cup. My future dream is… to surpass the Hokage! And that's why I'm going to
make everyone in the village… acknowledge me! My name is Sasuke Uchiha. There are lots of things I hate.
And not many things I like. Also…I have no intention of
saying I have a dream, but I do have an ambition. That is… to kill a certain man one day. I'm Sakura Haruno. What I like…I mean,
who I like is…um… My future dream is… You've already surpassed
the Hokage, Naruto. You're a hero and
everyone has acknowledged you. But becoming Hokage
is still your dream. And Sakura… I bet your feelings for Sasuke have changed from
what they were back then. You still love him,
but on a totally different level. He tried to kill you,
yet you still care for him. You won't cut him off,
no matter what. And you think it's your duty
to save him from the darkness. That's how kind you are. Sasuke… Your dream was to kill Itachi. Now that he's gone,
what do you desire? What are you heading towards? I was your teacher, but it turned out that
I didn't understand you at all. Even now… Sasuke… What is your dream now? What's the true meaning
behind you saying you'll become the Hokage? It might be fate that reunited the old
Team Seven like this, Sasuke. If you don't want to say what
you're thinking right now, that's fine. But the fact that we were
once Team 7 is undisputable… Right? In front! He's coming! You haven't forgotten
the lesson from the very first mission
to steal the bells, have you? Yes! Of course not! The answer is teamwork! Then dying together can also
be considered teamwork, eh? Madara…you have both Rinnegan. His lower body has
completely healed. Obito! Unfortunately, Obito is gone. I've taken over his body now. Seems he was hoping
to right his wrongs. He was praying like
a child, deep inside… so that he could leave
the future to you all. How convenient that would
have been for him, right? Just like a spoiled brat. I can't blame her. Given the power of those eyes. Lady Tsunade, it looks like I finally
caught up to them. I'm not retreating anymore. I'll be the diversion.
So follow me! Wait! Sakura! Rule Four! A Medic Ninja who masters
the Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration, the 100 Healings,
may break the first three rules! The same Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu as Hashirama's granddaughter. What?! An invisible wall?!
I can't reach him! What's happening?! Sakura… Don't worry about me, Naruto. Sasuke isn't even concerned
about me… I'm all right, so… Naruto! Yeah, I know!
There are more of them, right? That left eye is a Rinnegan! Madara's got four shadows now. Enough with this sideshow. What is he up to? Catastrophic Planetary Devastation! Retreat for the time being! What about Naruto and the others?! They will pull through,
no matter what! This is Six Paths' power? He's way bigger than before
and there's more of ‘em… Stop getting distracted
by what's above! His shadows are
on the ground with us! They're a bit more solid and
larger than raindrops, but… Here they come! The shadows as well! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Leave them to me! I guess I'll just record
their final moments! Kurama… Yeah! Susano'o! Tailed Beast Bomb Rasen Shuriken! Damn it!
There's no end to them! Unbelievable… Damn you! According to that stone tablet. When the one who possesses
the power of the Rinne, should draw near the moon… the eye that can reflect off
of the moon, and grant the infinite dream,
shall open. Shine upon the world…
Infinite Tsukuyomi. Where am I? What happened?

 Are you all right, Yamato?

 Lord Third!

 That's right! Kabuto captured me…

 That's happening in the war?
What's going on?

 Is Naruto all right?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Infinite Tsukuyomi."

 Pull yourself together, Yamato!

 THE INFINITE TSUKUYOMI


 Tune in again!

 When one who possesses
the power of Rinne, should draw near the moon… the eye that can reflect off
of the moon, and grant the infinite dream
shall open. Shine upon the world…
Infinite Tsukuyomi. Infinite Tsukuyomi

 I've used up my chakra and
can't release my jutsu! Wha—?! What is this? It's finally started… I'm done with this! Then we don't need these insides
anymore either. Again?! What's all this shaking? Over at 4 o'clock! Meteorites! There are so many! Brace for impact! What's happening over there?! That's not normal! The chakra Naruto gave everyone
has disappeared… And so has that giant tree. Something big is happening
over there, that's for sure. Most likely, it's something bad. What?! What's the matter, Kiba?! Shino… The moon! Look at the moon! This can't be! What is happening? This is really bad. I'll pulverize all the meteorites
with these next, so don't worry. You two stick close to me
and stay still! Okay! I have to make sure
I don't hit Sasuke! Go! Sasuke, don't head down here
so suddenly! I could've hit you with
a Rasen Shuriken—! Hey! Land more softly too! Just shut up and stay still! Not again! Now! Become one! Those eyes… Don't tell me Madara's launched
his jutsu already! My lord, this is terrible! Please wake up! My lord! What is it? We are much fatigued from
playing mahjong all night. Up all night?
Then why were you asleep?! Oh, never mind! Something terrible is
happening outside! It's night, yet it's bright as day—! This light can penetrate and
see through even shadows… No one can hide from it. And now… Divine…Deep Forest Emergence! Get ahold of yourself, Tsunade! What is going on? I can't move! Naruto! Naruto, don't do it right now! The light can't penetrate
that Susano'o? His Rinnegan can counter
even this jutsu? Don't go outside right now. Without this Susano'o
that my eye made, you'd get bound up in
his genjutsu as well! Also his shadows are outside… If you and I fall, it's all over! We need to bide our time. This is the Deep Forest Emergence! He's binding people using
the Divine Tree's life energy! Why am I not affected?! Yamato! Yamato… H-Hey? Where am I? What happened…to me? Are you all right, Yamato?! Lord Third? Well… Motoi! Get away from here! Yamato! That's right! Kabuto captured me… What's happening in the war?
What's going on? And Naruto! Is Naruto all right?! Get yourself together! This is—! Let the world of dreams now begin… A world without abysmal chakra! I was Orochimaru's guinea pig
and I was all alone… I had no family, nothing… Tenzo…Tenzo! Where am I? Tenzo! Hurry! Hurry! Yukimi? Tadah! How's does this look? Tenzo? I met Yukimi and got to know
Kakashi Senpai… And then, the place where I belonged became the ANBU Black Ops. Hey, Tenzo. Kakashi Senpai? Hurry up and get ready. We have a mission. R-Right! I'm sorry! If I stayed in the ANBU,
I wouldn't be alone. All the missions were harsh… I had no family,
so for someone like me, it was the best place. No, that's not right! The place where I belong, changed. Where I belong is… But that place belongs to Kakashi… Tenzo, what's the matter? Huh? Oh…Kakashi Senpai? What's happening? Did you finally realize? That this is where you belong. What's going on?
Why are you suddenly saying that? You're—! It's been a while, Yamato. I'll be taking Kakashi's Sharingan. Wait! Captain Yamato! Let's go after him! Only Team 7 can save Kakashi Sensei! You guys! Preparations are already set! Let's hurry! Captain! Captain Yamato! Captain! Yes, we'll pursue them immediately! Yes… This is where I… Damn—! Captain Yamato! Captain Yamato… You're—! Sasuke! Sasuke?! Chidori Stream! Why are you—? It's none of your business. Watch out! Damn it! I was careless. Are you all right?! Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Kakashi Senpai! Kakashi Sensei! Are you okay? Yeah…I'm fine. You saving me, imagine that. No, it wasn't just me. I had help from Naruto and Sasuke… Now, I can rest assured and
leave things to you. You are the only one among
my juniors that I acknowledge… From here on, you are officially
the captain of Team 7. N-No way! Team 7 is your… No, Kakashi is right. You performed admirably. There's no one else
I can entrust Team 7 to… Lady Fifth… Way to go, Captain Yamato! You give me peace of mind,
Captain Yamato! To me, you were my first friend,
Captain Yamato. Anyone else just won't do! Thank you…everyone! On top of that, Sasuke is back. I'm so happy for you…
Naruto…Sakura… A team approved by Kakashi…
Not bad. Sasuke… That's right… I can stay here. From now on, this is where I belong… From now on,
this is where I belong… Is this the Infinite Tsukuyomi? What in the world happened? What's going on?! Any way you look at it,
this is my room.

 Why is the Leaf Village—?

 Does this mean
we were transported here

 all the way from the battlefield?

 But, what's this feeling
I'm feeling?

 Even if we are away
from the battlefield,

 this is just way too peaceful!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The World of Dreams"

 What?! What is going on?! THE WORLD OF DREAMS


 Tune in again!

 To the Dreamworld

 Just a little more! With this, I can…! With this ninja tool,
I can instantly seal the enemy! But before that, I have to ask someone from
the Hidden Cloud how to use it! Wha—? Now…become one. I can't move my body… No… I have to… I have to save everyone! Huh? Any way I look at it,
this is my room, right? The Hidden Leaf Village… How? Does this mean I was… transported here
from the battlefield? What happened to the others? I'd better find someone! Hold on… What is this feeling? I might have left the battlefield, but this is just
way too peaceful! Tenten! So here you are. Thank goodness! So you and Lee got transported
here too, Guy Sensei? Huh? Like a newly appeared comet,
I am Rock Lee, the fashion trendsetter
of the Hidden Leaf! Coolly making my entrance! Nothing! That was nothing just now! What was wrong with it? A true fashion trendsetter elicits
such comments from others, not himself. Grown-ups behave in
a cooler manner, Lee. You're right! I shall be more careful from now. – More stylishly!
– More stylishly! Hold it! What are you up to
at a time like this? Like this? We're in the middle of a war! This is no time to
be joking around. What are you talking about? If you mean
the Third Great Ninja War, it ended a long time ago. Snap out of it. This is no time to
be playing the fool. From my standpoint,
you need to snap out of it. Huh? He's right, Tenten.
Open your eyes a little more. Huh? No way! That voice… You always wear
those ugly sports bras! It's time you wake up and
wear some better underwear! Huh? Sports bras? Hey… Why? What's going on?! That was totally uncool, Neji! You have no sense of style! This is also part of discipline! You've got to be kidding.
Neji's acting like a pervert? No…
Neji is supposed to be dead. So why are Sensei and Lee
acting like nothing happened? What's the big commotion here? Hey, you're just in time! Huh? It's the usual. Please scold Neji too, Menma! Huh? Menma? Something wrong? Aww yeah.
Barbecued meat is the best! Hardly. Even if it's dinnertime,
I want something light. Yeah? This is really light. That's hardly what I call light. You're always such a fool. Are you eating enough, Tenten? Huh? Oh yeah… I came just to make sure, but… Still Neji, your dirty mind
is a problem. I was just trying to
discipline her. Quit makin' excuses,
you disgrace to our clan! Do it again and
I'll rip your eyeballs out. Remember that. That's a mean joke, Lady Hinata. Oh scary… I couldn't imagine
doing something like that. Hey, don't take advantage of
the situation and get close to Menma or I'll kill you! Menma doesn't welcome
your kind of attention! Go away! Shoo! You go away! Shoo! Shoo! You're both pains.
Get away from me. – You're so cold, Menma!
– W-What? Don't get worked up. You have me. I don't need
a cheap flirt like you! Talk about a negative reaction. But that's what I like
about you, my kitten. Did someone say kitten?
I love cats! No one's talking about cats. But what concerns me is the source of the repulsive feeling
I've been getting… There it is! Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
We're eating! Relax… This spray is harmless
to the human body. And I show no mercy
towards bugs, not even tiny ones. That's not the issue! Thank you for the food. Huh? Are you leaving already? We're splitting the bill,
so you should eat your fill! I'm full. This is for my share. Lord Kizashi Haruno is the best! A toast…to Lord Fourth! I don't recognize that
Great Stone Face… This is no place I'm familiar with. And it's not a dream. So, I could be inside a genjutsu! Then I have to break the genjutsu
as soon as possible! Release! Release! Release! Release! Release!
I said, release! What's going on?! It's not working at all! Does this mean my release skills
don't have any effect…?! That's right,
I have to rescue everyone… I can't stay locked up here. I won't let you have your way! I'm going to get out of here,
Madara, and seal you away! If I'm going to escape
from this world, I have to learn every
little detail about genjutsu. Even if I can't reverse
the genjutsu, there must be some other way. But, old textbooks won't help, huh? Hey, Tenten! Are you up? Oh, is it time for
morning training? Wait a sec! This is a fake world
created by our enemy! I can't waste any time
with fake people. Oh, here she is! Good morning, Tenten. Even still, close up, they really did a good job
making you. What's with the weird talk
all of a sudden? Listen, I don't intend on
getting friendly with you guys. I don't feel like training
or going on missions, so please remember that. No training or missions? Hey, Lee… Do you think
Tenten's still half-asleep? Maybe… She left early yesterday when
we were eating barbecue… It's possible she caught
a cold too. I'm wide awake,
and I don't have a cold! Anyway, please leave! Okay, the distractions are gone! Now, to study all I can! What's going on
with Tenten anyway? Ditching training and missions
are taboo for a Leaf Shinobi! Nyah, nyah… She must really hate you! That's not the problem! Well, he might be onto something. I mean, your team's got
some serious issues. That's true. I wouldn't be able to take
all that vulgar talk. Are you saying
I'm the problem? No… The way I see it, her anger is directed at
something more than that. You mean… I'm also to blame? LEAF VILLAGE LIBRARY I guess I'll have to go to
the library to research this. It's not a place
I'm used to visiting, but… Hey, Tenten. You're back?
Didn't you hear what I said? I did hear you! And that's why we're here. Let's do this, Neji! – Please forgive us!
– Please forgive us! That was a nice apology. One's sincerity is displayed
by attitude! What is this? I'm not following it at all! Or…could they be
Madara's henchmen? Which means… they intend to coax and
drag me into this world?! Give them a break and forgive them. They're really sorry! I agree. Say, Tenten… You can try to approach me,
but it won't work! You, and you, and you! Don't come near me
until hell freezes over! What? Oh! Now she hates you even more! Until hell freezes over? Now, now…don't get so depressed. But I wonder
what the cause of all this is? Maybe she's not mad,
but worried about something? Worried huh? She doesn't have an appetite,
she rejects her friends… She's troubled
and wants to be left alone. There's no mistake… She's lovesick! That's all you think about. What do you think, Menma? We'll get nowhere just talking
amongst ourselves. You're right. So let's all do something for her! – All right!
– Yes! Nothing here. This either. Not this…or this…or this! I thought I'd find something
by coming here… But there aren't any
helpful books at all! I'm no good at researching things
to begin with. I prefer to have someone else do
the thinking for me… I wonder what's happening
with everyone in the real world. I can't be wasting time like this. A rose? That's a face longing for love,
my kitten. What's the big idea?! Sorry about this. I keep telling you to
stay out of my way! Are you leaving already? Well, you're bothering me. Don't be so rude.
We're all just worried about you! You can cut the act, you fakes. Tenten…? You can try to get in my way,
but I'm not giving up. I'm going home to
my own world! She's got it really bad. Thanks to your stupid idea! Oh boy… She's beyond our help. She's in full battle-mode
and she's just not listening to us. So you didn't fare any better, eh… If she's not upset about
Neji's pervy comments and she's not in love… What do we do? We just have to
leave her alone. Oh, but that doesn't mean
ignore her. I agree. Tenten herself seems
to want that. Isn't that…a little cold? I don't think we should
leave her alone. Something bothers me. Menma, you're such a good,
thoughtful friend! The complete opposite
of that Tenten! I'll go beat some sense
into that wench! One moment, Lady Hinata! She disappeared! She left a clone.
The real one is already gone. That Hinata! This only gives me a bad feeling. I'll track her scent. Follow me! A whole day and still no leads. Will I be able to go home? Am I stuck here forever? What is this? What an ugly weapon. Don't just take it.
Give it back. No way. If you want it back,
apologize for today. Everyone's worried about you, and all you do is insult us
and make accusations. Tell us plain and clear…
just what's going on? Here she is! Hinata, you're being too rough! Shut up! We'll get nowhere otherwise! Fine, I'll take it back by force! Hey! Hinata! Stand down, Tenten. What's going on? That was… Hey, wait! Damn it! That's was something
you just don't aim at friends. What's going on? You deserved it.
You aren't my friends. I didn't ask you
to worry about me. I have my own goals. And I don't want you
to get in my way. This isn't where I belong. I don't care about
this village or you! You're lying! I mean… That's not the kind
of person you are. Think what you want. What's with her anyway? This is more than weird. It's like she's a totally
different person. She makes me so mad! They're fighting.
Isn't it terrible? Kids these days… I see… What I want to know
is how to escape.

 But when the usual methods
don't work

 and you can't rely
on your friends…

 Sounds tough.

 Maybe if you were a leader
instead of a follower,

 you could do it.

 I figured…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Where Tenten Belongs."


 Aww, jeez…
I can't think of any other way!


 WHERE TENTEN BELONGS


 Tune in again!

 Where Tenten Belongs

 Mom, I'm going out. What? Eat first.
Everything's ready! By the way, did you look at your dad's papers
without permission? I know how interested you are, but you're not even a jonin yet… Really! I guess they're not coming
to get me today. That's not the kind
of person you are! What was that all about? It's like they were making me
the bad guy. No, no, no! How can I be swayed
by a fake?! Maybe it's proof that
I'm being affected by this world! I have to return to my world! I hate having to ask someone,
but I have no other choice. If anyone knows
about genjutsu here, it has to be… Now what brings you here? I have something to ask you. You know a lot about genjutsu,
don't you, Sensei? Genjutsu? Sensei? Well, yes! I can't use genjutsu,
but I just love THAT jutsu! Huh? You can't use them? That's why I'm hooked on them and have collected all sorts
of data about them. Come in, come in! SUPER SECRET SCROLL This is amazing. So what do you want to know? The most beautiful jutsu? The most majestic jutsu? Or the most frightening one? I'm not into the crazy ones! What I want to know
is how to undo them. Oh, that's too bad. Like when the usual
release jutsu doesn't work… or when you can't expect help
from your friends… That's very hard. That's possible if you're a grade
above the jutsu user, but… I figured as much. What if you inflicted wounds
on yourself? Would the pain undo the jutsu? I can't recommend that either. There are genjutsu that inflicts pain
over and over again. Rather than undoing the jutsu,
it would do so much damage, you'd end up being an invalid the instant
you returned to the real world. I see… Sir, I'd like a large plate of
sesame dumplings please. Sorry, we only have plain dumplings. I'll have that then…
a large order. Oh man, what more can I do?! I can't think of anything else! What's wrong? Seems like you're in
a bad temper as usual. I saw the commotion yesterday. You were the one fighting
in the park, huh? Oh… What happened? I'm looking for a way to undo a genjutsu placed by
a higher-ranking shinobi. That's if there is a way. Well, I heard something
a while back… Huh? Seriously? When you travel around
doing business, you hear a lot of things. As I recall, there's a shinobi who's skilled
at that in the Hidden Rain Village. Here, this is a map of the Hidden Rain. You're letting me have it? Maybe it was fate we met. Anyway, use it. With your "shinobi legs,"
you'll get there in just a few days. That's what he says, but the Hidden Rain and
the Hidden Leaf don't have an alliance. If I go there on a whim,
I'll be branded as a deserter. But I have no choice! I've got to get home to everyone! Where do you think
you're going? They were waiting for me? Why?! Binding Syrup! It's no use resisting. Give up. But I can't believe you'd betray us. Check her possessions. Okay. Hey! What're you talking about? Oh, this too. Give it back! Give it back!
I don't have a clue! Don't pretend. We got intel long ago that the Hidden Rain was planning
to attack the Leaf. And, that the one helping them
was lying low in the Leaf. And just as we were
tightening security, we were tipped off that
you were acting strange… and even planning to desert. Wait a minute!
I know nothing about that! Trying to deny it even
though you had this? It's a secret missive addressed
to the Hidden Rain. We'll get the rest out of you
during questioning. Take her away. Right! Wait! I know nothing about this! Nothing! She was going to betray
the village. How low can you get? I'm not a conspirator. Even that map… It was him! He gave me the map
to frame me… In fact, he must be planning
something right now! I have to let them know. Everyone! Hey—! I misjudged you, you idiot! Is this what you meant by not caring
about the village anymore? That's enough, Hinata. Come on, pick up the pace. I guess their reaction is
to be expected. Damn it! These guys aren't
my friends or anything. Who cares what happens
to this fake village? But they even took my scroll. What's going to happen to me? Over here, Tenten. Lee…? Are you okay, Tenten? From the looks of it… you seem to be in
a real dilemma. I wasn't peeking! Neji, restrain yourself! If we're discovered,
there'll be hell to pay. Yeah, sorry. You guys? Why… Sorry about earlier. If we defended you publicly, it would've made coming
to see you difficult. Why are you here? Well, we couldn't ignore
a comrade who's in trouble. We believe in you. First and foremost,
we wanted to tell you that. I said you weren't my friends. As if we'd believe something
so arbitrary! How long have we been together? Yeah, it's been every single day since we graduated from
the Academy. You wanted to become
a shinobi like Lady Tsunade, one of the Legendary Sannin. Neji wanted to change destiny. And I wanted to prove that
I can be a supercool shinobi even if I can't do ninjutsu. Every day, even if there's wind,
rain, storm or snow… On our birthdays, at new year's,
during summer and Christmas… We three kept at it earnestly under Guy Sensei's
over-the-top guidance… and never, ever gave up! Tenten? It's nothing. It's true, to Guy Sensei everything
is a training exercise. Yeah, he's a real nuisance. Guy Sensei is a nice grown-up. He's really cool! – You sure about that?
– Yes, he is cool! It feels strange, having this conversation
in here in this world… Maybe even in a fake world,
our feelings can be true. Lee, the guards will be making
their rounds soon. We'll catch the real culprit! Wait! The man who tricked me
is disguised as a merchant. But be careful. I'm sure he'll use this incident
to cause some trouble. Got it. We'll warn everyone! Good luck…I guess. – It's an attack!
– We're under attack! Damn it! Where did you come from? You scum! Are you all right, Lady Hinata? Why did they attack so suddenly? I thought the spying was done! Hinata, look! A Summoning Formula? So they're set up here and there
to summon the enemy, huh? Damn it! This is bad. Are Lee and the others okay? Him… Why are you—? I knew all about this thanks
to intel that my dad received. Ever since you started
acting strange, I've been secretly watching
over you. I didn't notice you at all… But the whole time I was watching, you did nothing
but research genjutsu. And when you were caught… I concluded that he was
the real conspirator. I wanted to put an end to it
before it came to this… But they activated
the jutsu formula. This is—! It's important to you, right? On the way here, I spoke to the higher-ups
about the conspirator. So, you're free to go. Why? I might desert
the village again. To be honest,
I can't figure you out. I don't know how to put it… I feel like you're Tenten,
but not the Tenten I know. And you keep talking
about "going home" And I think your home is located
somewhere far away from this world. What was that? Menma, can you hear me? Lee?! Hurry! Get out of here! A giant Summoning Beast is
going wild near the Academy. Everyone's trying to fight it off,
but at this rate… We need your help right away! All right. I have to go. You should return to
where you belong. It's true. I'm not from here. I want to save everyone,
and I want to go home quickly. I thought I didn't care
about this world. But… …let me go with you. I'm sure I can help. Super Expansion Jutsu! You…! Choji! Tenten! What are you doing here?! I've been cleared. I'm going to fight too! That's more like it! Fine… Let's stop this thing. Your fighting spirit is commendable,
but this is where I come in. Menma! I knew you'd come! Everyone, get back. Right! The Leaf's Tailed Beast?! That's amazing! That's Menma for you! Go, Menma! Take it down! It ends here. The Hidden Leaf will be destroyed. What happened? No way… We can't stop another one. If it gets any closer… I'll take it from here. What are you saying? You can't handle that thing! We have to move back or
the flames will get us! Please run away, Tenten! No, I won't run. I've made up my mind. I won't let it run wild. I'm going to save everyone! What you did was amazing. I can't believe you took on
such a powerful enemy and stopped it cold! You're the top weapons
handler of our day! When it comes to using Ninja Tools,
no one comes close to you. I thought we were goners. Thank you for protecting us! Don't mention it. I wanted to do this. Yes, it's just as I had hoped. I was able to protect everyone,
and the world with my power! But…is this really okay? It's okay. The fact that I'm alive
and that the world is safe… is all thanks to you. Oh…okay. Let's celebrate…
Tenten has come home! – Welcome home!
– I'm so glad you're back. – This is great!
– We can't do anything without you! I'm home! A Jinchuriki, all alone!

 A Jinchuriki, just a brat,
so forlorn.

 Yo, Naruto!

 Lord Killer Bee is here
to save you, yeah!

 Killer Bee?

 It was you!

 You spilled my instant ramen!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Killer Bee Rappuden: Part 1"


 You can eat as much ramen
as you want—


 after we get out of here!


 KILLER BEE RAPPUDEN: PART ONE


 Tune in again!

 It's the Infinite Tsukuyomi… So right now, everyone is… …inside a dream. Killer Bee Rappuden: Part 1


 Hey… Oh yeah, who are you? So, how do we proceed? Fool, ya fool!
What else can we do? We're Jinchuriki. We're going straight through, baby! Stop! Intruder! What is that? A Jinchuriki, all alone! A Jinchuriki, just a brat,
so forlorn. We've come to
rescue you, Shukaku. Gyuki! Then he's—? Yeah, he's my Jinchuriki. Puppet Dolls. They're much bigger than dolls. Watch out.
They move on their own! I'm counting on you, Eight-O! Don't put so much pressure on me! Why you—! Let's run, baby. Run? Are you asking me
to desert my village? Fool, ya fool!
Be freer! Besides, we have a mission
that's greater than our village or the Five Great Nations. Mission? That's right.
We have a mission, something only
we Jinchuriki can fulfill. How's that? I'm out of chakra… Run! Damn it! I have to get my gourd back. Don't worry. Is this it? The source of Gaara of
the Sand's Absolute Defense. We mustn't forget this, Bee. Thank you. Long time no see, Shukaku. You're here too, Matatabi? You can stop pretending
to be asleep. It's not like I was sleeping
because I wanted to! So what do we do next? We got One,
so next is Nine. Then I'll go and look
for the other one. I'll leave it to you, baby. And you come with me, Gaara. Nine Tails? Where is he? In the Land of Fire,
in Hidden Leaf Village. Let me out! Let me out! Hey! I'm gonna become the Hokage! Just leave it at that! Day in and day out. You know it's impossible.
Don't you ever get tired of that? It's not impossible! If I keep making a racket like this… Let me out! Shut up!
Eat this and be quiet. Yes! It's here! This is what it takes
to shut me up. Damn it. Just a little more… Stop! Intruder! My ramen! A Jinchuriki, all alone! A Jinchuriki, just a brat, so forlorn. Yo, Naruto! Lord Killer Bee
is here to save you, yay! Killer Bee? Was it you?
Did you drop my instant ramen?! You can eat as much ramen
as you want after we get out of here! Stand back. Get back, Naruto.
He's on our side. Uh, okay. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Watch out. It's a special barrier jutsu
made to bind Tailed Beasts. Weeee! Lariat! Awesome! How did you do that just now?
Can you teach it to me? We have to hurry
out of this village. What? What about my ramen? You can eat some
somewhere else! I want Ichiraku's miso
and char siu ramen. I won't let you get away! Are you okay? Ouch… This is… We're probably underground
somewhere within the Leaf Village. You think this is
where the Foundation was? You've got guts,
trying to steal the Leaf's Jinchuriki. It's the Hokage… Granny Tsunade! Furthermore,
you're Jinchuriki too… Tailed Beasts that flew
right into the flame… Do you want to become
the Leaf's Jinchuriki too, Jinchuriki of the Sand, and friends? I won't let that happen. Hey, what's wrong? No bra… Nah, she's fooling you. She's an old lady, y'know! How come you're so tense, Octopops? Hey! What're you focusing on, Bee?! We'll settle it with this! Lady Tsunade!
You can't be serious?! We're dealing with
three Jinchuriki. We can't have them
ravaging the village. Okay, odds or evens,
a single round! If I lose, you're free to go
anywhere you like. Lady Tsunade! If that's the case,
let me do this! Stay out of this, Shizune! Don't spoil my fun… I mean, this is the Hokage's job! But your gambling skills aren't… I would like to… check the dice. Be my guest. Shukaku. You got it. They're good. Lady Tsunade, did you just see—?! Shut up, Shizune! Yes, ma'am… Fine. Let's begin. Well then… H-Hey…You're shaking it too much. Okay, place your bet!
Odd or even! Even! It's even, okay? And I'm odd! The bets are placed! And the winner is—! It's…snake eyes… I feel sick! What's going on
with this raccoon dog? That's cheating! Why you—! Why don't you… Take this! Make a run for it! Hey, Octopops! Bra… Get yourself together! This way! Stop! Made it! That went well! How?! We got the Nine Tails Jinchuriki
without a scratch… We worked together,
now we're pals. Ramen… Ichiraku ramen… Gimme a fist bump! Lemme eat ramen! Hey, you've got some potential. Gimme a fist bump… Lemme eat ramen. We're friends, me and you. Menma and char siu. Let's cooperate and
help each other Add an extra egg to my order. We're Jinchuriki,
and we should be pals, each and every one of us… But now, we're far apart
and feeling suspicious So you're planning
to find the rest of us? That's the plan for now. Let's go! I wanted to settle this amicably,
but there's nothing more to say. Use force if you have to. Just bring Naruto back before
he crosses the border. Right! What should we do about
the Cloud and Sand's Jinchuriki? I won't ask the impossible and
ask you to capture them. We are talking
about Jinchuriki here. Capturing three at the same time
is damn near impossible. The priority is capturing Naruto. The Jinchuriki are
traveling northwest. I believe they're headed
for the Hidden Waterfall. Go! – Right!
– Right! The Tailed Beast's power
isn't at 100% right now. Do you know why? Because most of the power
was stolen. Yes. That's why if every Tailed Beast
goes at full power, chakra will be used up
in no time. Stolen? By whom? The Akatsuki. Akatsuki? They plan to use the power
of the Tailed Beasts to change the world. There's a princess who is trying
to oppose the Akatsuki. So we're gonna protect her and take back
the Tailed Beast's power. Where is she? In a certain castle. But first, we have to gather
our comrades… All nine Jinchuriki. They're sure to make their move
during the next full moon. So by then… We should avoid
all known paths and highways. Right. Oh! Just wait a minute. Look! What about a tea stand
at the mountain ridge? It's not a tea stand!
It's a ramen stand! ICHIRAKU ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS
 WORLD FAMOUS SANSAI RAMEN
 Control yourself until we get
to the Hidden Waterfall. The Hidden Waterfall doesn't
have a single shop listed on the map of
nationwide ramen shops! Let's get a move on. Before they catch up,
we have to be gone. Aw man! It looks like they're already here. Instead of scrambling, why don't just hunker down
and prepare for them here? So tasty! This is so good! I pity anyone who hasn't tasted
ramen this good! Wood Style! Please don't resist. We only have business
with Naruto. I don't want your business! A shadow clone?! Sand? An octopus leg? Acrobat! Are you okay? Let's do this! Use my chakra! I won't let you! Weee! Yugao! Wee! Why you—! Everyone, get back! Roar, Strong Arm! Wood Style! Domed Wall! Where did they go? They got away… Or rather, they retreated. Yeah, but I doubt if
they've given up. Is once the limit for
Tailed Beast Lariat? It seems so. Sorry, Bee… No worries, Eight-O. C'mon, let's go. I guess this isn't the time
to be eating, after all. Of course not. One Jinchuriki is hard enough, but with three of them
joined together, ordinary means won't work. But at least it's clear right now that the Tailed Beasts can't
release their original power. It seems their chakra
runs out right away. I attached a transmitter
on them, so we'll track them and
wait for reinforcements. We're okay, Captain Yamato. Let's go. The Tailed Beasts may
have run out of chakra, but we're still dealing
with Gaara of the Sand and the Cloud's Killer Bee. We can't make any mistakes
from here on. And… Hidden Waterfall Village
is just as I expected, the scenery is amazing. But Octopops… What do we do now? We don't even know what the Seven Tails Jinchuriki
looks like, right? It's sure to work out quick. Jinchuriki are fans
of arithmetic. I hate arithmetic! And stop talking nonsense! Be careful, Bee. I sense something ominous
coming our way. Naruto! Gaara! That guy's Itachi… Akatsuki… That's them? Each member in the Akatsuki
has a unique ninjutsu. What's more,
Itachi possesses the Sharingan and can put Tailed Beasts
under genjutsu. Do not look directly
into his eyes. We have learned that Jinchuriki
have joined together and are behaving suspiciously. And we, the Akatsuki,
cannot overlook that. Fool, ya fool…
You stole our line. What about that Akatsuki,
what's your design? You guys want to tangle
with us? I'll take that one. It's an even three versus three. Yeah! That's perfect! Hold your horses, you guys. We Jinchuriki, get into formation,
dance in joint collaboration. Naruto! I'll take care of that one! Looks like I get to take you on. For some reason,
I really want to take you down. I'll beat you at
your own game, hmm. Not if I can help it! Itachi! Sasuke left the village
to go after you! What are you gonna do?! Wake up, Naruto! It's a genjutsu! We don't want a brawl
We just want safety for us all. Acrobat! For Jinchuriki… Yearlong security! Gimme a fist bump!

 Just hearing that we're Jinchuriki

 makes people hate us
and detest us.

 That's our fate as Jinchuriki!

 Fool ya fool!

 Then we're just gonna have to
bust through that fate, right?

 We're the same Jinchuriki as you.

 I won't fear. I won't hate.
I won't detest.

<i>Is Naruto dead?</i> Look at that... I wonder if he still wants

I have Sasuke with me... Oh, uh... <i>Damn!
<i>I didn't make it in time...</i> I won't let you step in. You're rushing to conclusions. I don't plan to fight you guys
anymore. Actually...it's the opposite. What do you mean? We both have the same goal. The Akatsuki are in the way. If I let you live... I think you might

is still alive, huh? So... What do you want to talk about? I have a message from Danzo
to Lord Orochimaru. The truth is... Before that... Choose your words carefully
when you talk to me. If not, you'll die. I can only relay
what Danzo has told me. If that does not satisfy you,
then I'll leave it up to you... Captain, can you teach me the Jutsu
you used earlier? That is impossible. Why? I am the only person in the Leaf Village
who can use that Jutsu... because I inherited
the First Hokage's cells. It's always like this...
I can only do little things for Naruto. The size of the things you do,
big or small, are not important. What is important is
how you feel about Naruto. I can tell by just watching.
The truth is, you are... Next episode:
"The Secret of the Battle!" Killer Bee Rappuden: Part 2

 Acrobat! So the Jinchuriki can fight,
a little. I can fight well, I'm infallible.
But to you, I can't be affable. If you know where Sasuke is… …tell me! What? Sasori! Deidara!
I'm done here. What do you mean, "I'm done"? I'm leaving the Akatsuki. What are you saying? I'm leaving with Nagato. Don't run away! Hey, so what are we going to do,
Sasori, my man? Do you need to even ask? We're going to
take them down ourselves! It's three against two. Doesn't matter. Guess you're right, hmm. I'll show them my art. What is this? Hey, you! Why are you causing an uproar
in the Hidden Waterfall Village? Who is that? That's the Seven Tails' Jinchuriki! She is? Hey, Chomei! Fuu, they're comrades. Comrades? Of mine? Hey, Jinchuriki!
They're the enemy! I don't understand
what you're saying. Now it's four against two. Okay, let's retreat! What? Okay! I'll get you next time! What? They took off! You're Fuu of
the Hidden Waterfall, right? Gimme a fist bump! Hey, what's the matter? You're kinda shady, mister. What're you saying, baby? C'mon, gimme a fist bump! Hey, what's the matter?! You're kinda shady, mister. What're you saying, baby? C'mon!
Gimme a fist bump! No! – A fist bump!
– No! – Give it here!
– No! – Give it here!
– No! At any rate…
just give him a fist bump. Gimme a fist bump! No! Wait! You have a mission
to carry out! I don't take orders from shinobi
from another village! We're comrades.
You could even say we are friends. Friends? We're friends? Yes. You are not alone. Fuu seems to have
softened up to Gaara! This started out
with a lot of trouble. But I'll say,
the result is acceptable. Octopops, I think your facial hair
and shades are to blame. Shut up!
Let's move on to the next one! Ten Tails?
What's that? A gigantic weapon that
the Akatsuki summoned! It absorbed
the Tailed Beasts' chakra which is why we can't
utilize our full power. Right now, Ten Tails can't summon
its full power either. The princess of Rappu Castle
sealed it. But the Ten Tails has ultimate power
on the night of the full moon. They'll target the princess
and go to the castle. Unless every Jinchuriki
comes together, we won't have a chance against it. The nine of us will protect
the princess and the castle…yay. Gimme a fist bump. W-What's the big idea? Hey, Son Goku! Tell him that we're not enemies! You heard him. I'm sorry about that. Suspicious characters
have been showing up lately. So I assumed you were one of them. I'm telling you…
it's that facial hair and shades. No need to critique my physique. What do you mean by
"suspicious characters"? I don't know who they are… but they've been kidnapping
children from our village. It definitely appears like
it's tracking prey… Chomei! Let's chase 'em away! Agreed. Scale Powder! It was a summoning? If you interfere,
I'll show you no mercy. Sasuke! Naruto…
You were able to leave the village? What about you?
You're coming back to the village! I don't take orders from you! Are you the kidnapper?! What of it? Sasuke! You've stooped so low
to be Orochimaru's underling, that you've started
doing things like this? And you don't even know
how Itachi's feels! Don't you dare mention
Itachi's name! Itachi deserted the Akatsuki
and is looking for you! What? My, my… A gathering of Jinchuriki… I wonder what
you're all planning to do? Orochimaru… Although you're probably helpless because your Tailed Beast powers
have been stolen… Sasuke… Shall we destroy them? Orochimaru… I'm done here. What? What do you mean
"I'm done"? I'm going after Itachi. Hey, hold it! Naruto! Don't forget the mission at hand! You're the one
behind the kidnappings! I'll punish you now! Powerless Jinchuriki… I wouldn't talk if I were you… Summoning Jutsu! So, what are you going to do? Son Goku! Lord Orochimaru! I'm okay! I'm out of chakra… Shukaku! Lord Orochimaru! I'm okay! My turn! Lord Orochimaru! I'm okay… Tailed Beast Lariat! L-Lord Orochimaru! Oh my…This is too much
even for me. Take this! – Well?!
– We did it! No, that's just shed skin. Even if they're weakened, they still pack a punch
when they join forces. He's as tough as ever. But he looks worn out! Lord Orochimaru… I'll get you next time! One down… Come with us so that we can
put a stop to the Akatsuki's plot. All right. We'll join up with Yugito
and the others. I still can't locate Yagura,
the Three Tails' Jinchuriki. He wasn't in the Land of Water. Any clues? Yagura is supposedly heading to
some wetlands somewhere… But I can't verify it. Even if you can't, we need
all of the Jinchuriki, right? Yeah, unless every Jinchuriki
comes together, we can't beat the Ten Tails! Those guys will begin their attack
on the next full moon… targeting the time when
the seal will weaken. How much time do we have left? About seven days. Let's split up and
search for Yagura. Otherwise, we'll have to fight the Akatsuki
with one member short? We'll split up into two-man teams
and search in all four directions. All right, everyone! No matter what the result, do not fail to gather at
Rappu Castle in seven days! Let's go, Yugito! Look forward to working with you. Okay… Can you see anything? No…
There's mist everywhere. Then I'll check around in Sage Mode. What's that?! What's wrong? Pursuers from the Leaf… They're looking for me! Get on! It seems no one wants to give
Jinchuriki their freedom. Yeah… They treat us like dangerous vessels
that contain Tailed Beasts. We're not dangerous,
and neither are Tailed Beasts! It's Yagura,
the Three Tails' Jinchuriki. Gimme a fist bump. I refuse. Isobu, tell him! Without a doubt,
these two look suspicious, but they are Jinchuriki friends. Jinchuriki don't have friends. Just being Jinchuriki fills people
with fear, resentment and hatred. Sometimes, we're hunted by
people of our own village. That's our fate as Jinchuriki! So I want no part of this. I'll stay here by myself. We need your power. Go away! Come with us. That is your destiny. Don't force anymore destiny on me. Do you want me to force him? Stay out of this. We are all Jinchuriki. The fate forced on me as a Jinchuriki
is more than enough for me! Whether it was forced on you or not,
this is your fate! Shut up! Fool, ya fool… As long as it's your destiny,
you've got to see it through! Bee?! You! We're the same Jinchuriki as you. We don't fear you.
We don't resent you. And we don't hate you. Gimme a fist bump. Let's combine your power
with ours. It will soon be the night
of the full moon. How come Octopops isn't here?
He's the one who planned all of this. Not just one person is missing,
but three. Will we be able to pull this off? Probably not. What should we do, Aunty Yugito? "Aunty"? Oh, I mean… Sister Yugito. We have no choice but to have faith
that Bee and the others will come. They've appeared. Go! Let's go too, hmm. No need to rush.
Wait for the moon to rise. The Akatsuki genin are attacking! Defend the castle!
Don't let a single one get inside! Water Style: Bubble Jutsu! Lava Style: Scorching Rocks Jutsu! Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! Looks like we have to
get involved, hmm? That's not necessary. The Gedo Statue?! They're gonna use that to attack! It won't be at full strength,
but it should suffice. But there isn't a single fragment
of art to it though. It's a Tailed Beast Bomb! Damn! The way I am right now,
I can't take it down. Is everyone okay? Now! Charge! Th-This isn't good! Steam Dash! That's...! Friends! Now that I'm here,
you don't have to worry! Sorry to keep you waiting! You're late, Octopops! But you found Yagura of the Three Tails! Yeah! All nine of us are together! Okay, Jinchuriki! Raise your fists! What is that?! One Tail. Two Tails. Three Tails. Four Tails. Five Tails. Six Tails. Seven Tails. Eight Tails. And Nine Tails, y'know! We are the Jinchuriki
who stand before you! That's kind of artsy! It doesn't matter at this point
if they're assembled together. Hey, hey… There are Tailed Beast Bombs
over there too. What of it? Shukaku! Matatabi! Isobu! Son Goku! Kokuo! Saiken! Chomei! Gyuki! Kurama! This isn't good! Don't think you've won! Next time,
I swear you're going down! Hmm! Phew…
I'm pooped. I'm out of chakra again. We won. We did it! Yeah, we did. But unless we get back
our Tailed Beast power, we can't call this a true victory. That said… Today's a huge win! Karin! Wake up!

 Karin! Get a hold of yourself!

 I'll go get the Medical unit now!

 Sasuke, Sasuke, it's okay…

 It's too—

 So…so…I have a request…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 "To See That Smile,
Just One More Time."


 Like that one time, back then…


 TO SEE THAT SMILE,
JUST ONE MORE TIME


 Tune in again!

 Karin! Wake up! Karin! Hang in there! I'll get the Medical Corps
right away! Sasuke, Sasuke, it's okay… It's too— It's okay… So please… Please… Okay? Sasuke, please…smile. Smile, Sasuke. Like that one time. To See That Smile,
Just One More Time

 No! Karin… You said you didn't feel well. Hurry up! We have to help out. It's the requirement for us
being allowed to stay here. But! I'll be right back. No! Be a good girl. Mom! Mom! Mom… Stand up. MEDICAL
                      HIDDEN GRASS HOSPITAL Where are we? We took huge losses
from a surprise attack. The village is overflowing
with the wounded. We won't make it with
just your mother. Mom?! Let me go! My mom…! My mom is—! There was no other choice
in order to protect the village! What—?! It's unfortunate that
you lost your mother, but we still have more wounded. You're late! Where's that woman? She's dead. She's going to take over
from today. Huh?! This child? Can she handle it? She is that woman's daughter. She has the same ability. No! Let me go! No! We're letting you stay because you have
nowhere else to go. Work enough to earn your stay! It hurts! Damn it! It hurts! Don't worry! We'll heal you in no time. No! Now go on, bite! Please…stop. We took your mother
to your house. From tomorrow, go to the hospital even
if no one comes to get you. Over there! Send more chakra! Forget him! It's too late. Check the one next to him. Don't dawdle! Come with me! That one can be treated
with medicine. Continue just like that. Now this one! Hurry and come with me! Hey, you have work to do! Don't stop here! But I've never been
on a battlefield… Shut up! If you can't run, I'll kill you. Stand! Go. Come on! Mom… The higher-ups have decided
to let you take part in the next Chunin Exams. Me? This exam displays the strength of each Ninja Village through
their genin's abilities. It's considered a war by proxy. We cannot afford to lose. Your duty is to keep the other two
completely replenished. We took in an outsider like you… Keep that in mind and make sure
you get us good results. Yes. NO TRESPASSING Damn it… They're all monsters! How can we steal a scroll when defending ours
takes everything we've got? But we can't back off! The honor of our village rests with us! Then we'll go back to tracking. And we'll definitely
get it done this time. What should I do? You'll only be in the way
if you come along. Take this and stay hidden. Okay. Oh yeah.
I have to keep hiding. Lions Barrage! The Earth Scroll…same as us. My glasses! Later. MEDICAL
                     HIDDEN GRASS HOSPITAL You've been such
a disappointment. I hoped for better results
than this! I guess you're just an outsider… so you don't feel any loyalty
for the village. That's not true! I—! Then prove it. Hurry to the north fortress. North fortress? The fighting's raging there. The north fortress? Of all missions… That place is teeming
with the Kaguya Clan. They're a terrible, bloodthirsty bunch. So far, the north fortress
is keeping them at bay, but… Yeah… I hear this is going to get real ugly. You're going to be a great help. There are only so many fighters. But with you here,
they'll heal much faster, right? Please start right away. Oh, but… I should have known
an outsider wouldn't… What amazing dedication! Hey, everyone… Bring in the wounded
from outside one by one. I can't go on… If I stay here…I'll die. Help me! I'll bet this redhead is a remnant
of the clan from the Hidden Eddy… You were right when you said
she'd be worth something. A shinobi without a homeland
is quite tragic. But, you know… You must decide for yourself. If you come with me,
no one will ever touch you again. You're Karin? The one Lord Orochimaru mentioned? I understand you have
an unusual power. So…where is Lord Orochimaru? He's a very busy man. So you're assigned to me.
Come with me. Who are these people? We use them for experiments. The research Lord Orochimaru is
conducting requires a lot of data. I'm thinking that
you can help with that. Okay, here we are. He was the subject
of an experiment, but we're in a bind
because he's gotten so weak. I also want to see your power. Okay… That's quite amazing! Leave it to Lord Orochimaru
to see your potential… I'm counting on your help. Where are we? The Northern Hideout… The old place doesn't compare
with this one in scale and set-up. This is what you would call
a real experimental laboratory. From today,
you'll be helping with the experiments
on Jugo for a while. Jugo? Jugo…the one and only
killing machine of the Curse Mark. Karin, you did well. Thanks to you, I was able to perfect an enzyme
from Jugo's bodily fluids. So, how about it? It's up to you, but would you like
to be in charge of this place? Lord Orochimaru… You've been through
many hardships. You should stay here
and take it easy for a while. I'm humbled by those words. Though I'm still young
and inexperienced, I'll do anything you ask of me,
Lord Orochimaru. Please excuse me. Now…I'll finally… Number 97 is scheduled
for surgery this afternoon. It will be difficult,
but I want you to assist. I got it. I just have to keep him
from dying, right? Exactly. Who is that? Oh, that's Sasuke. He's Lord Orochimaru's favorite. He's a bit strange. He sought us out in order to
become strong for a certain goal. "A goal?" But he probably won't fulfill it. He's destined to be
Lord Orochimaru's next vessel. I am…the one who will unravel
the mysterious of this world! I am the one
who will receive everything! So it was you after all, Sasuke. Karin, come with me. I need you. Huh? Why would I follow you? I'm under orders
to oversee this place! Orochimaru is gone. Suigetsu, release everyone held
prisoner here in this hideout. What—?! As usual, ordering people around… You can't just come here
and take over! You don't know what it took
to keep things in order here… Without prisoners, there won't be
any need for a warden. I'll say it once more.
Come with me, Karin. What will you do? Sasuke! This is bad… Here, Sasuke… Hurry up and bite me! Do it now! Sasuke! Are you all right? Hurry and bite! Karin, Suigetsu, Jugo… Thanks to your help, I was able to bring down
Danzo the Hokage. But my goal now is
to destroy the Hidden Leaf, become the Hokage and build
a new Hidden Leaf Village. This is the critical moment. How is the war going? The same… They're such jerks. Taking advantage of the chaos from you becoming
the Hokage to attack… Bad news. Karin's been… I thought you were a spy
from the Leaf. But we've stumbled across
someone very interesting. Do you know her? Long ago, the Grass took
in this wanderer. If you bite into her and
suck out her chakra, it will heal every kind of wound. Hey! Take her to the medical tent! Stop! I don't care if it kills her. She betrayed the people
she was indebted to! Suck out every ounce of chakra
until she dies! Karin! Wake up, Karin! Hang in there! I'll go get the Medical unit now! Sasuke… Sasuke… It's okay…it's too— I just have one favor to ask… Please, Sasuke… Please smile…Sasuke. The next episode is the first
of Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:

 The Tale of Naruto the Hero!

 Grandma Tsunade is under
the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

 In her dream she reads
a story Pervy Sage left behind.

 And, the protagonist
in the story is…

 M-Me?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Loser Ninja."


 The protagonist, is a loser? 


 THE LOSER NINJA


 Tune in again!

 Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero
The Loser Ninja



 This…can't be. What is happening?! Snap out of it, Tsunade! What's going on?! I've completed my latest work! Jiraiya!
You never even contacted me—! JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS SAKA-SAKAYA What are you doing? I'm in the middle of writing
my latest work. Another "Makeout" whatever…
So ridiculous. Now that hurts. This new novel is different from
the others and very innovative. I'm still in the middle of it, but it will be a masterpiece
about the "future of shinobi." You'll be the first to read it
when it's finished. No thanks. "Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls"… "Long ago, there was a Fox Spirit.
This fox had nine tails…" "If this fox lashed its tails once," "it could smash mountains
and create tidal waves." "A band on ninja arose to defend
their village from attack." "A lone shinobi staked his life
to seal away this beast." 'Morning. 'Morning! You came home late last night. Yeah… I was with Lord Third. How did your discussion go? Huh? You mentioned an important meeting.
Did it go well? There's no need for you to
dirty your hands anymore. The unlikeliest alliance between
the Uchiha and Senju has protected the peace
of the Hidden Leaf Village… And will continue
from this night forward until the end of time. Oh, it was fine. Where's Naruto? He said an important mission
was going to be assigned today so he couldn't be late, but… Naruto! Naruto! What?!
It's already this late? 'Morning! I'm off! Hey, that's bad manners! I have to hurry or I won't make it for the meeting time
Kakashi's Sensei set! It's always like this. You spoil him too much!
Can you please scold him too? All right… All right. All right! We're going to get
an S-ranked mission today! Oh, isn't that the Nine-Tailed… He's still the Hokage's son. Just let sleeping dogs lie… I don't like it one bit. All right! Who's there?! Scaring me like that! Hey! Oh, it's you, Young Lord Naruto! Mister, how much is this mask? Don't even ask! I can't take money from you,
Young Lord! Lord Hokage would
scold me if I did! Please take it. That's okay.
I don't have any money today. I see… Thank you though.
I'll come back to buy it. Sheesh! Lord Hokage this,
Lord Hokage that… Hey, throw some salt! It's supposed to be a secret
in the village… But everyone knows
what that kid is. If he weren't the Hokage's son, he'd have been chased out of
the village by now. Hey, Shiro! 'Morning! Oh, Naruto! Good morning. Hey, Big Brother Itachi!
Good morning. Is Sasuke around? Thanks for coming
to see him all the time. My kid brother is
just so unfriendly. Leave him to me! I'll train him right. Thanks. Be a good friend to him. Sure. Who's training whom? I'm not so pitiful that I need
a loser like you to train me! It's okay! I don't mind at all.
We're friends, aren't we? Since when are we friends?! You don't have to come and
get me every morning! Just seeing your face during
missions is more than enough! Yeah right…
you're actually happy that I came. What's wrong? Who's that?! What happened?! Are you okay? Hang in there. A-Ageha… Kakashi Sensei,
what's our new mission? Before that,
I want to show you something. Look here. The names of legendary heroes
are carved here. Legendary heroes? I'm definitely going to make it
so my name gets on here! They were all killed in action
during missions for our village. Huh?! But there are those who
put their lives at risk and fought for the village… and even saved their comrades. Yet, they weren't given
a heroes' burial, let alone buried in
an ordinary grave. Why isn't this person
with the others? During an extremely
difficult mission, he was a captain and
infiltrated enemy territory… There, he was faced
with a difficult choice. Continue the mission or
sacrifice the lives of his men… Which did he choose? Clearly, he chose
his comrades' lives, right? In order to save the lives
of his comrades, he cancelled the mission. I knew it! However,
the village suffered huge losses. He was held responsible
and blamed for his actions… In the end, even the men whose
lives he saved criticized him. As a result, the deep hurt took
its toll mentally and physically… and he took his own life. – But…that's—!
– Why?! He broke the code in order to
save his men's lives! The first thing we learn
at the Academy is that the mission takes utmost priority,
under the shinobi rules. But! In the shinobi world,
those who break the rules are scum. That's… However! Those who don't
value their comrades… …are worse than scum. And so, until you get
the signal to assemble… go do some training. Scatter! – R-Right!
– R-Right! What's the matter? So tell me… Why was I grouped together
with Naruto? Do you object? No, I don't have a problem with it. But if he's put on a team where there's too much of
a difference in skill levels, he's bound to suffer. You were the Academy's
most promising student. Are you blaming Naruto for S-ranked missions
not coming your way? Because it certainly seems that way. I didn't mean it like that… It could just be the opposite. I have a feeling that today's the day
that we'll get an S-ranked mission! All right! I'm gonna go all out! Honestly… How can you be so positive
about life? Well, I'm gonna be
the Hokage some day! For the sake of the village,
I can't be a downer! Talk about dreaming… No… It's possible Naruto
might become the Hokage. Sasuke! So you do acknowledge
my abilities, after all! Don't be stupid. You're the son of the Fourth Hokage. I'm just saying even the biggest loser can follow in the Hokage's footsteps
with a little favoritism. What?! You have no right to
talk to me like that until you beat me with your ninjutsu! I don't need ninjutsu to beat you! Lions Barrage! Stop! Don't fight!
We're on the same team! That was nothing… Sasuke! Let's race to see who can
make it to the top of that rock. On your mark! Hey! Get ready…go! He doesn't know when to give up! Lord Hokage just gave us
the sign to assemble. But Naruto is… What about Naruto? Damn it! Like I'm going to give up. I'll never give up
despite what anyone says! Sasuke… I don't see him catching up!
I knew it! Damn it! It will be interesting to see… whether the power
you have been given is truly for you. If you don't want to die,
figure it out yourself! I'll never give up!
Never! Never! No way! A voice in pain…
A bitter and sad voice… Y-You're huge! You're the—! I wasn't expecting to
hear that from you… Didn't your parents tell you? Oh, you're the Nine-Tails, right! Then this will be quick. What brings you to me? I'm letting you live inside my body.
You owe me some rent. What?! Lend me your chakra! You, ordering me around? You're greatly mistaken… Anyway, if you die, I die. I'll show you first. Watch carefully! Summoning Jutsu! If I could do that… Summoning Jutsu! I'm safe. So Naruto dashed off for that rock? Yes… He challenged Sasuke
to a race. But I didn't want to get involved. It seems he jumped over this. What?
He fell from here?! What a fool. Hey! What are you doing? Better hurry or Dad
will get mad at us! FOURTH HOKAGE Jiraiya Sensei… Over there! I must put up a barrier immediately… My chakra is almost… I can still do it…Minato. Kushina! Did I wake you up? I'm sorry, Naruto… Kushina… I'm going to pull the Nine Tails
with me… to my death… Then… Kushina, there's no need for you
to die with the Nine Tails… You sealing the Nine Tails' chakra in
your state is physically impossible. But half should be possible… And the other half? I will seal it inside Naruto
with the Eight Signed Seal! I know what you want to say… But in time, the Nine Tails' chakra… will open up Naruto's future
as a Jinchuriki. I believe that if Naruto is ever
in danger, it will be invaluable. But right now,
it seems to be just the opposite. Well, he's just not able to manage the Nine Tails'
enormous power yet… I'm sure he'll learn to
control it in time. If…Naruto is truly
the Child of Prophecy. But if he's not able to
fully control the Nine Tails… Was it too soon…
to let you go on this mission? No, sooner or later…
You'll have to overcome this trial. All of our classmates have
assembled for this mission. Yeah… It's turned out just as we feared, huh. What? Well, I want as little as possible
to do with that guy and complete the mission
successfully. Each team will take
a separate route to the target site. Once there, you will search
for the missing shinobi. Send word the minute
you discover them! Do not rush out to try
and rescue them! Understand? You don't have to keep reminding us. I'll rescue every one of them! Seems like someone over there
doesn't get it. I knew it… This is going to
turn out to be a drag. Scatter! All right! Let's do this! Right around then, the young shinobi
who just made genin,

 made their way to a village
that had lost their jonin.

 Amongst them was
the Child of Prophecy, Naruto.

 I know it's sudden, but let me
go over the next mission.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Search Mission."


 Naruto, you will most likely be
the one who…


 JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS:
THE TALE OF NARUTO THE HERO
THE SEARCH MISSION


 Tune in again! This…can't be. What is happening?! Right around then, the young shinobi
who just became genin, made their way to a village
that had lost their jonin. Amongst them was
the Child of Prophecy…Naruto.  Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero
The Search Mission


 What happened? If there's something that you know,
please tell me…whatever it is. I'm sorry. Izumo and Kotetsu
suddenly disappeared and I just got out of there
as fast as I could… To be honest, I don't even
remember how I made it here. I understand. I'm sorry to put you
through all that. But even if you remember
something minor, please tell me. Ageha… An Ageha butterfly… He's probably talking about
the Shinobi Ageha… During this season, it's not unusual to see them
in the forest near that village. Is it a poisonous butterfly? No. Its powdery scales
stimulate chakra flow and it's even a main ingredient
in food pills. I can't believe Izumo and Kotetsu
were beaten so easily… Looks like we're all set. No, Team 7 is still… Sorry, Team 7 is late. We're all here now. I know it's sudden,
but let me go over the mission. I hope its way more exciting
than looking for a lost cat. This mission is very important. Three teams of shinobi that were
dispatched on secret missions have all gone missing. Your mission is to
search and find them. Yahoo! However, you are to contact
the Hidden Leaf the moment they are found. Any attempts at rescue
are forbidden. Why?! Considering who's been chosen, the answer should be
pretty obvious to everyone. Is it because we're all elite ninja
overflowing with talent?! Nearly all the shinobi who
went missing are capable jonin… But the only one who was able to
make it back to the village, was a genin. So it could mean, experience
and maturity are being targeted. Which means? In other words, we were picked
because we're newbies who just became genin. Well, you could put it that way… What? Is that all? Naruto, you will most likely
be the one who— Everyone, stop! What is it? Isn't our target village
further ahead? Look. What's that? Shinobi Ageha? All right! I'm gonna go catch 'em! Hey! You! That's really not necessary… I'll bring him back! Oh really? Come on! Oh boy… Eight Trigrams Grid Palm! This is… Kakashi Sensei! Naruto! Get back here right now! What the hell? I almost had it! Don't go off on your own
during a mission. What did you just say? I don't take orders from you! What? This isn't an order! I'm telling you to act
more like a shinobi! Going off on your own
puts others in— Sasuke!
Kakashi Sensei's in trouble! – What happened?
– Kakashi Sensei's… When I noticed, he… He was dragged underground, huh? No way! What—! Asuma! Damn it…
They got him. What? What happened? Where's Asuma Sensei? I-I don't know… Is this… …sensation, chakra?! What happened, Akamaru?! Akamaru's barking not because of
something happening. It's because
he lost track of Kurenai Sensei who should be present. What is this? Byakugan! There's a current of chakra
underground… Where is it coming from? Neji! Where are you going? I want to check something! Stay with Guy! Guy Sensei! Does your chest hurt?! It's nothing that
a little perseverance can't… Guy Sensei! Don't push yourself! I'll go get some water. Tenten, stay and watch Guy Sensei. All right! What happened? Guy Sensei felt sick and… Where's Guy Sensei?! Black vine-like things sprang up, wrapped around Sensei,
and pulled him underground. What? The current of chakra is gone. Hey! Kakashi Sensei is probably
in enemy hands. What are we supposed to do? What else is there to do?! We're gonna find him no matter what
and get him back! Damn it. I'm never giving up! Hey, what are we going to do? What's going to happen? First, we should contact
the other teams, then contact the Leaf Village
like Lord Hokage ordered, right? Wait. Don't move! What? Damn it. What the Fourth Hokage feared
would happen just happened… Huh?! It's probably safe to assume that the same thing has happened
to the other team captains. The other teams? So it's not only us… But Sasuke and Kiba and… Everyone's been left behind? Yeah… I just hope Kakashi's team isn't
arguing with each other right now… Since they have someone
who can be a real drag. Why you—! Wait, you loser! I already told you! I'm not giving up! But where are you going? Well, I don't know, but… Are you really the son of
the Fourth Hokage? What did you say?! Do you really think the Hokage
would send us out without making any
preventive measures beforehand? I saw the Hokage
pass out special kunai to the captains, back then. Special kunai? Yeah… The one he marks when he uses the Transportation Ninjutsu
to teleport. As long as the mark is there,
he can track anyone, anywhere. Transportation Ninjutsu? You know what
the Summoning Jutsu is, right? Uh…yeah! Think of it as
a type of that jutsu. The special kunai is the target and no matter
how far away you are… you can transport to the kunai
in an instant… Lord Fourth is the only one
who can use that jutsu right now. I see. I gotta admit… My Dad's pretty awesome! Wait! I don't think…
that's going to happen. Huh? That's… I found it at the spot right now. This is the worst situation
we can be in… I think I can visualize Lee making
a big fuss over Guy Sensei. Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei!
Guy Sensei! Guy Sensei! Wait, Lee! Calm down! That's impossible for me! Is the Shinobi Code more important
to you two than Guy Sensei's life?! Don't get the wrong idea! You blockhead! Guy…Sensei. What are you doing? Just listen! Just before Guy went missing, there was an unusual current
of chakra underground. You saw it with your Byakugan? Yeah. But it's disappeared now. So, I'd like to check in on
the status of the other teams. Linking up with the other teams
is our priority right now. So, the key players
will be Kurenai's team. How so? Kiba's sense of smell, Hinata's Byakugan and
Shino's Parasitic Insects… With their sensory skills, it will be easy to find the current
locations of the other three teams. And they can probably find the location where
the team captains are being held. You're right! That would make it way faster than
just proceeding blindly. In situations like this, panic and proceeding without
thinking is our worst enemy. It makes more work for everybody. So until we join up
with Kurenai's team… …we'll just sit tight. Choji must've had
barbeque last night… – Kiba!
– Kiba! – How is it going?
– Hey! Asuma's team is over that way. Those guys aren't moving at all. They know we're looking for them. They're just sitting back
and resting. In any case, let's join up
with Shikamaru quickly. Then we'll pass on his ideas
to the other teams, and come up with a unified plan. That's because I have a feeling there's someone who's going to
act without thinking through things… And that's where
our abilities come in. Exactly! Shikamaru's acclaimed intellect
still needs us! According to the plan,
Kurenai's team should be over here. Right. Blood?! I have already cursed you. Huh? Preparations for the ritual
are complete! Now! Let's experience
the ultimate pain together! What's with this guy? He keeps talking about
curses and rituals? He's dangerous! – Naruto!
– Naruto?! Doesn't it hurt? It's gonna be excruciating
so prepare yourself… It's god's commandment!
Tremble in fear! He's fast asleep. He may seem so,
but he wakes up sharp and alert. Besides,
it helps replenish his energy. You're too easy on Choji. And you're too tough. I knew something was up. I totally thought it would
happen later though. I should have known they weren't
going to let us rest so easily. It's coming! Paper Shuriken! Wind Style: Gale Palm! Damn it… We have to
get out of this Paper Storm… Choji! Can you break it apart?! I've had enough rest! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! Roll, roll, roll, roll! Roll, roll, roll, roll! – Roll, roll, roll, roll!
– Water Style: Raging Waves! You're the ones! You guys took Asuma Sensei, right? Bring Asuma Sensei back! Just who the hell… …are you? Don't think you can
escape my curse! The shinobi world is cursed! Just give up! When the man in the strange cloak,

 impaled himself
with his pointed scythe

 Naruto felt an excruciating pain…

 Seems like this guy
is more than you can handle.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Team Jiraiya


 Long time no see!


 JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS:
THE TALE OF NARUTO THE HERO
TEAM JIRAIYA


 Tune in again!

 Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
Tale of Naruto the Hero
Team Jiraiya


 When the man in the strange cloak, impaled himself with
his pointed metal weapon, Naruto felt an excruciating pain…
in the same area of his own body. Don't think you can
escape my curse! The shinobi world is cursed!
Get over it! What? A Clone? Na… Ru… To… Uzumaki Barrage! Did you see that?
It's my Naruto Uzumaki Barrage! An imitation of my Lions Barrage. What did you say? This is not the time to be arguing. Oh yeah, that's right… Where's Kakashi Sensei? Who knows? We were merely hired to help
with the experiment. Experiment? Yeah… To prove that there's no hope
in a cursed shinobi world. It's a pain… so I figured I'd give you
the answer real quick, but… What? I don't think he's the kind of
opponent you can handle. Why you! Hey there, long time no see! Trained by the Great Toad Spirit
of Mount Myoboku, also known as the Toad Sage… …we are the trio from the Hidden Rain known as Team Jiraiya, remember that
and let our presence be known! T-Team… Jiraiya? Jiraiya? Are you talking about one
of the Legendary Sannin? The one who's cool and suave, with that irresistible
sidelong glance that makes a girl fall madly
in love in a second? Also the one who's admired by
every guy in the Hidden Leaf and who ranks at the top of
the most desired master list? What the hell is this?! Jiraiya's too full of himself! Team Jiraiya… Actually, we're called
the "Akatsuki" which isn't too catchy
or cool at all… But just remember the three of us
as Team Jiraiya. So you're Jiraiya's pupils? Are you implying that only guys
from the Hidden Leaf can train under Jiraiya Sensei? What? I didn't mean it that way! It really rubs me the wrong way… When you imply that
we're not shinobi since we're not from
the Hidden Leaf and the Five Great Nations
and the Five Hidden Villages? Like I said…I didn't say that! We're not a big, fancy village… but guys like us
from the Hidden Rain are just as good as you, got it? Remember that and
let our presence be known! All this time, the Hidden Leaf,
Stone, Sand, and Cloud have waged war whenever
they felt like it… And we got stuck in the middle
with nowhere to go… our homeland got ravaged
and destroyed… All the while, you could care less
about our suffering! Wind Style! Gale Palm! But we'll rise up. And we won't let our bitterness
hold us back. We'll move forward even
if we have no place to go. Liberty is Team Jiraiya's goal! And we'll turn the tables
on you all! And that's why you took
Asuma and the others?! Your passionate speech just now… I understand where
you're coming from. But I don't understand
why you would capture Asuma and my comrades
from the Hidden Leaf… The Leaf, The Leaf, The Leaf! Does the world revolve
around the Hidden Leaf? Give me a break! Seriously, give me a break! Sasuke! Why you—! You dare to kick
an apostle of god?! Curse you! What the hell is this?! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! Are you okay, Sakura? Thank you Sasuke! Whaaat?! Judging by this, there's no doubt the other teams
are in the same predicament. You're right…so what do we do? The sooner we join up with them,
the better. Any objections? N-No… What's going on? This is weird. We can't go
in the direction we want to. It's possible
we're being led astray! They're not coming after us… Why did you cut in like that? I could've offered those kids as
a sacrifice to Lord Jashin, while I was at it! It's because we're not
under contract for that and you were about to mess up. Our job is simply to capture
team captain-level guys. We won't earn money
just killing brats. The world doesn't revolve
around money. What's the use of living
if you can't enjoy life?! That's a luxury we can't afford. Every action we take
has a priority. That's pretty harsh. Here you go. What? You take care of this one. I'm going to round up the rest
of the captains we've hidden. Hey! Oh, Akamaru Yeah, it reeks here with the scent
of Shikamaru and the others. I picked up the scent
of three guys. It seems like there was fighting
here until just moments ago. They moved as they were fighting… I can tell because… …they left telltale signs
of their movements. Shikamaru and his team are okay… I don't smell any blood. Let's hurry after them. A village… But don't you think
something's not right? Not one sign of anyone in
a settlement this large… It seems they wanted
to lure us here. What do we do? Wait for Team Kurenai here? Yeah… Those guys just now
probably laid out a trap and are just biding their time. The more of us there are to fight,
the better. We don't have a clue about
the enemy's strength, so it's better to join up
with the others first. Why are you the one giving orders? Our captain's gone. Isn't it standard procedure for the next best-qualified person
to make the decisions? I agree…
If it's between Sasuke, who graduated at the top of the class
from the Academy… …and you, who came in last
in our class, and was only allowed
to graduate out of pity… Yeah, if your dad wasn't
the Hokage… What? Wanna fight?! Now that would be interesting.
I'll prove who's better. There's nothing I'd like better! Hey, you two! Never say that again in front of me… You haven't sensed it yet? Huh?! Hey guys! You were all okay? I don't see Guy Sensei. Yes. Guy Sensei went missing suddenly. Kakashi Sensei also disappeared. There were signs that showed
he was dragged underground… Yes, a black rope-like organism tangled
around Sensei and dragged him away! Yeah! That thing attacked us too. You encountered the enemy? Yeah… They claimed to have been hired. Hey, let's hurry and rescue them! Don't be in such a rush. But—! I saw chakra flowing underground
just before Guy went missing. We've pretty much pinpointed
the source of the chakra. Then… The remaining teams
should be nearby too. We need to regroup
with every team first… and set up base camp. Who knows what's happening
to Sensei and the others while we're wasting time like this… First, we need to regroup
with the rest of the teams. There are a few things
I want to confirm with them. Like the status of Asuma and Kurenai. Guy lost consciousness…
and went missing. The exact same thing happened
with Kakashi. Why do you think they
both lost consciousness? Come to think of it… Kakashi Sensei was looking at the Shinobi Ageha butterfly
before he disappeared. The powdery scales of
the Shinobi Ageha and the chakra flowing underground
possibly interacted with each other… There's probably a jutsu
that doesn't work on us, but affects only the jonin. But the scales of the Shinobi Ageha
aren't toxic. I don't know how the jutsu works. But, like I mentioned,
there's one more thing I want to verify! What? That's—! Lord Fourth's kunai? What's going on? Isn't that the kunai that
you found earlier, Sakura? No… This is one that Guy Sensei dropped. Two jonin dropped the kunai entrusted to them by Lord Fourth
at the spur of the moment… That's hard to believe. So if we figure that the enemy
dropped them intentionally… It's got to be someone with
considerable knowledge of various jutsu? It's probably someone who knows
the secret behind Lord Fourth's kunai… We'd better hurry and join up
with the other teams fast. The tracking team of Kiba,
Shino and Hinata would be able to pinpoint
the location quite accurately. Yeah, I'm sure of it. And once we know the location,
can we rescue the captains? No. Once we know their situation,
we'll send word back to the village. Right. We haven't been given
the orders for a rescue. Sticking to the rules again?! We don't have time to wait for
reinforcements from the village! I don't care what anyone says.
I'm gonna rescue them. Mmm… I smell food. How about doing some search
and reconnaissance inside the village? Are you kidding?
That's just looking for trouble. I guess you're right… Shh! Look! Let's follow. Now Komichi… Let's hurry and get Kenta. Fighting's going to start soon right? If there's a fire, Kenta will die. Then why'd you leave Kenta? Well, because—! Thank goodness!
It hasn't burned down yet! Kenta! I'm sorry! I'll never leave you again! We were just like them
back in the day. Caught up in other nations' wars… Running scared… We didn't want any villagers to
get hurt from our strategy… So we told them all to evacuate… Damn it… Now we're no different from the Hidden Leaf
and the Sand from back then… Komichi! Hurry up! We have to run away before
the fighting starts. Wait, big brother! Hey… Are you kids from this village? Please tell us.
Where's everyone else? You don't have to be scared. We're not scary people. Run away, Nagato! Hurry! Get away! Damn it! All right then… Have you seen a group of
two guys and a girl…just like us? Yahiko…! Nagato…! Nagato! Komichi! Those kids are—! This is bad! No way… Did I…? What was that? It's coming from inside the village. Is it the enemy? Is there a team fighting over there? What's happening inside the village? That direction is… …the village marked on the map. The scents of Shikamaru and
the others are coming from that way too. We should head there immediately. That's because that cloud
of dust is a sign of something big happening
over there. What're you doing! Hurry up! W-Wait! You should listen until a person
is done speaking! That's because…Hey! Wait! This is bad. We have to save those kids! Wait! We can't. Don't go. Why? Shikamaru… The siblings fall into the sinkhole,

 Team Jiraiya rushes in to help,

 but Shikamaru does not make a move.

 We have to do what
we came here to do.

 The cave-in that suddenly occurred
swallowed up the siblings. Yahiko, Konan and Nagato,
who call themselves Team Jiraiya, immediately went after them. But, Shikamaru did not budge. This is bad. We have to save those kids! Wait! We can't. Don't go. Why? Shikamaru! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero -
Order of Priority


 The enemy's up ahead!
Watch out! What is that? What do you see, Hinata? Looks like the ground caved in. Do you see Shikamaru
and his team? No… There's no a sign of them. I can't track their scent
because of the cave-in. I won't be able to
until the dust settles. I can't believe the cave-in
could be just a coincidence. Hey, can you hear me? Hey, kids! Hey! Please answer us! Where are you? We're coming to save you! Could they have been swept away? Let's go! My… My eyes…did this again… They did this to those kids… Nagato. Look… we have to find
those kids first. Just focus on that right now. Is this really okay? Are you sure we don't have
to help rescue them? Those guys are on their way. That's not the point… It just doesn't seem right… Think about our priorities. Right now, our team captains
have been taken and our mission is at a standstill. It's our priority to regroup
with the other teams and come up with a plan of action. I know that, but… The shinobi who were here
in the village have gone to rescue them. We have to do what
we came here to do. Even if it is a drag… We can't afford to be indecisive. Let's move to a bigger area where Kiba and Akamaru
can track us easily. The Leaf isn't coming after us. Now we know what
they're really like inside. This should be good enough. I'll let him know
just what happened. Yahiko! Konan! This tunnel… Hey! What's the matter? These walls…this tunnel… Were they…created naturally? W-What?! Lord Mashima… Lord Mashima… Please protect my sons! Please… Please… Please protect them
and keep them safe! I'm sorry to interrupt your prayers… We're just passing through, but… What is this? It's Lord Mashima. He sleeps beneath the earth… …and protects our village. Did something happen
in the village? We maintained a modest,
peaceful way of life, so as not to awaken Lord Mashima. But then, just recently, strangers came to our village and warned us it might
become a battlefield. They told us to evacuate to
a safer place for a while. We were forced to leave our village. But… My two boys returned
to the village… I tried to go after them, but they were much faster
and we got separated. That's why I'm praying to
Lord Mashima for their safety. Lord Mashima? Here it comes! It's huge! What is it? Not good! There's no place to escape! You saved us, Nagato… Thank you. We barely made it. What was that just now? I don't know. We have to get to the kids. What is that? Kakashi Sensei! Kakashi Sensei… Come here,
if you want to save them. If you don't, I'll execute them. Don't move! Guy Sensei! Calm down! Don't fall for their trap! We have to get word of this to the Leaf Village
as soon as possible. Yes. We'll have to break up
into two teams. One stays here, the other goes
to notify the village. No… there's a chance
we'll be ambushed on the way. We have to maintain our combat power
as much as possible. You'll abandon your friends…
to follow the rules. So the essence of the Hidden Leaf
has been passed down to its younger generation too. That's right.
And that's how it should be. Whoever he is, that guy
is trying to challenge us… and break up our strength. I'm… I'm not like you. – What?
– I'll never turn my back on them! – Naruto!
– Why that—! Come back! I'll go! Take care of things here! Neji! Big brother…
We lost Kenta! We'll find him later. You promise? Big brother! Big brother, I'm scared! It's all right. Kenta! Hey, Shikamaru. Let's not do this. I don't think this is right. Deities are supposed to be
inside these shrines, right? You're asking for
divine punishment! I knew it. I was right, after all. Okay… Let's go meet this Lord Mashima. What? This is—! Come on! I'll filet you into three pieces! Nagato! There they are! It's coming! What? A second one?! Stay away! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder! Komichi! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! You guys… …came. What happened to Neji and Naruto? What was that just now? It's probably some kind
of time-space jutsu. But who could use such
a high-level ninjutsu? Damn it… Thanks to him,
we have more trouble to deal with. Where are we? I don't know… Are you the one responsible
for all this? Hey! Return Kakashi Sensei and
everyone else from the Hidden Leaf! Or else…you're gonna get it! Naruto, get away from him. Don't butt in! I'm about to settle this right now! Look at his eyes. Huh? The Byakugan? You're no match for him. Who are you? How do you possess the Byakugan? Don't tell me you have ties
to the Hyuga? Look at the cloud of dust… Your comrades did that. What happened? They put their village's rules
before the lives of children. The Hidden Leaf hasn't changed
a bit in all these years. What would you know
about the Hidden Leaf? Oh, I know plenty. In fact, I know more
than anyone presently here. Follow me… Neji Hyuga. If you want to know
the ugly truth that the Hidden Leaf has covered up
in this village. What? What is he talking about? Let's hurry back to the village and
report our present status.

 We don't want
any more casualties.

 What are you saying?

 It's not just Guy Sensei,
but Neji is missing!

 As well as Naruto,
who's on your team!

 Neji and Naruto looked up… and found themselves in
a space different from before… Are you the one responsible
for all of this? Hey! Let Kakashi Sensei and everyone
from the Hidden Leaf go! Or you're gonna get it! Naruto! Get away from him! Don't butt in! I'm about to settle this right now! Look at his eyes. Huh? The Byakugan? You're no match for him. Who are you? How do you possess the Byakugan? Don't tell me…
Do you have ties to the Hyuga? Look at the cloud of dust… Your comrades did that. What happened? They put their village's rules before

 Komichi! Shadow Strangle Jutsu, complete. You guys… …came. Hurry, get the child! Damn it! Komichi! Ino! Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu! No! Nagato, go! Hurry and find that monster! Leave it to us! Her psyche has entered
the child's body. That's…possible? Ino's probably jumping
around inside of it. Konan! Now! Ino! Komichi! Big Brother! Choji! Hey! I almost got blown up! What's up with his eye? – Mommy!
– Mommy! Ashitaba! Komichi! You two—! I'm sorry, so sorry! Lord Mashima protected you…
the both of you! No, it was the people over there… Where did they—? Tell us… Right from the beginning, I didn't get the feeling that
you wanted to kill us. You were trying to get us
to do something. I was wrong about you. You'd never disobey an order
from the Hidden Leaf… You can't live outside
the rules of the Hidden Leaf. I assumed you were
that kind of shinobi… But I was very wrong. Through your actions, you demonstrated what
Jiraiya Sensei taught us to do. You used your powers
to help people in need, even if they aren't from
the Hidden Leaf… I was really happy that
you came back. Thanks to you,
we were saved too. Are you joking? Would the three of you like
to work with us? What are they talking about? Didn't they abduct Asuma Sensei? Yeah… I'm not asking you to join us… I don't care if you stay with the Leaf. We can travel from nation to nation, like Jiraiya Sensei, and cross over
meaningless borders… Let's show the world
that we're free! What does that mean? Well, it's kinda unclear… In other words,
be like Team Jiraiya, right? I want our aspirations
to be united…with you. You haven't even told us where
Asuma Sensei and the others are… We're not that naïve… First, you have to help us
get Asuma Sensei back. Yeah, that's right. We can't help you with that. There's someone else
pulling the strings, isn't there? This "test" doesn't seem
to be your idea either. Sorry. They haven't given us
the details. You don't have the details, but you have some idea
of what's going on. What a drag… I guess it means
we'll have to fight it out… If we're at odds with each other… there's no other way. One of yours? Yeah, three plus a dog. And they're strong. Are you implying that we're weak? Shikamaru! Choji! Ino! Hey. We were waiting for you. You're late. Oh, we ran into some trouble. Wasn't someone else just here? No… It's just been us all this time… Strange… I caught scent of a few others… Oh, really? Anyway… What do we do, Shikamaru? Yeah! That's why
we rushed over here! Yes, we'd like you to take the lead. Our first priority is to report
on the situation to the village. We need to get instructions
from Lord Fourth. Of course… We'll do what we can to get Asuma
and the others back! In order to allocate the tasks, we'll join up with
Teams Kakashi and Guy. It's a drag…
but let's wrap this up quick! We can't waste any more time. We'll return to the village immediately
and report on the situation. We can't afford any more casualties. What are you saying?! We've already lost Guy Sensei. And now, even Neji is missing! And Naruto from your team! This all started because
he took off on his own. After I warned him not
to make a move… We're from the class
ahead of yours, so we don't know him that well… But isn't he an important friend
and member of Team 7? Friend? Not only that… He's the precious son
of the Fourth Hokage. Who cares? That has nothing to do
with the mission. How can you be so cold?! To me, Guy Sensei is
a dear mentor! And Neji is a precious friend. I can't just turn my back on them! Lee, calm down! Anyway, I'm going to look
for Guy Sensei, Neji and the others! They're bound to be
somewhere nearby. So there's no way I'll stop looking
and return to the village! I won't let you. We have no clue
what the enemy will do, so we can't split up
our fighting power. We must move together. Oh! Neji, Guy Sensei! I'm coming to rescue you! Okay, Lee! I get it! I'll help you, so please—! I'm surrounded by idiots. But… What are you going to do? The two teams did
meet up perfectly… But now, they're moving
in different directions. I wonder if something happened… Can you tell anything specific? One group is moving away
from the village. The other one is frantically
scrambling around the village. That's got to be Lee… So then Team Kakashi is trying
to leave the village? Are they heading back to
the Hidden Leaf Village? It's plausible. That's because Sasuke,
who's cool-headed and rational, is on Team Kakashi. Anyway, we'll regroup with
the ones closest to us. That would be the group
in the village, right? Yeah… If we're going to rescue
Asuma and the others, the last thing we need is someone
making a fuss and standing out! We need to go and
calm Lee down first. Now, follow me… If you want to discover
the true nature of the Hidden Leaf. What is this?! What's going on? Old Man Third! And… Who are the others? Hey, hey, Neji? Be quiet! You can make
all the noise you want. These are just images
of past occurrences in the Hidden Leaf Village. It can't be helped. If my life alone will save the village… Hiashi… Don't be hasty. The Hyuga Kekkei Genkai is
a crucial secret weapon for the village. It is your duty as the head
of the main family to protect it. But if my duty to my family results in embroiling the village
in a hopeless war… I understand. That is why there is a branch family. We have no choice,
but to hand over… Hizashi's body as your stand-in. Father… Who's that guy? Do you know him? Hizashi Hyuga… He's my father. It went down exactly
as Lord Hiashi told me…  Where is the strong-willed Hiashi
I've always known? The magnitude of this is greater
than anything we've faced before. I can't just agree to it. Hizashi, you…! Please let me go. But you have…Neji! Why would you choose death
for the sake of the main family? You are wrong. I've always resented
the main family. Truth be told,
I even hate it now. That's why… I want to die,
not to protect the main family… but to protect you,
my older brother. This is the first time in my life where I have the freedom
to choose. I have shown Neji
only the hateful side of me. So… Please relay this to him… I am not being killed in order
to protect the main family. I have chosen death
of my own free will to protect him, my brother,
my family and the village. Are you saying that choosing death… is freedom? Elder Brother,
just once in my life, I wanted to change
my destiny as a Hyuga. That is all. Do you get it? Do you understand how
he must have felt? Having no other choice
but to say those words. He had to die for
the Hidden Leaf Village. It was a fate
he could not change. The one sliver of freedom he had was choosing to die
to protect the ones he loved. You're wrong! The Hidden Leaf isn't like that! That's my hope too. It's now the era of
the younger generation… and I hope there is change. H-Huh? However… You are already bound
hand and foot to the code of the Hidden Leaf. You have no choice
over your future or the future of the village. I know that now. That's not true, you—! And now that you know… What will you do? If the village cannot be changed
from the inside, there's nothing left but to force
a change from the outside. What do you say? Would you like to follow me? Neji! You're not thinking of—! Imagine finding you here…hiding. It's been a long time… Orochimaru. Are you telling me you can change
the Rules of the Leaf?

 Yes.

 To do so, I need collaborators.

 Come with me!

 I understand…

 Neji! Don't go!

 Wait here. I just want to hear
what he has to say.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Sealed Power." No! I won't let you go! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Sealed Power Tune in again! Lady Tsunade? What is it? You haven't eaten at all today. Oh, I didn't realize
it was this late. Is that work? No. Just Jiraiya's silly novel. Oh…you mean
the "Make Out" series… Actually, no.
This one's a little different. It's about Naruto, Sasuke,
and the young generation of the Leaf. It's actually a good read… I can't put it down. Really? Anyway, what would you like
to do about dinner? I'm at a really good part right now… Shall I have dinner brought to you? Oh, I'd appreciate that. All right,
it will be just a moment. Okay…where was I? How do you know about my father? Why would someone like you,
from another village, want us to change
the laws of the Hidden Leaf? Our dissatisfaction is common
throughout the Shinobi World. If we first change
the Five Great Nations and its most influential village,
the Hidden Leaf, the entire Shinobi World will change. Are you telling me
you can change the laws of a village as great
as Hidden Leaf Village? Yes… And that is why I want
collaborators who will cooperate. Is it them? You will suffice… Follow me! All right. Neji! Don't go! Wait here. I'm just going to
hear what he has to say. No! I won't let you go! You just aimed for Chakra Points
that would paralyze. Yes. His life isn't in danger. Hang in there for just a while. I want to see what he's planning,
then I promise I'll be back. N-Neji… Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Sealed Power


 No need to worry about them. They share my views. We would like to present
our report… Is this about the disturbance
involving the young siblings? Yes… This is in regard to
the cave-in that occurred while we were fighting
a few of the Leaf Genin. At one point, a monster that
was nesting underground endangered the kids' lives. For a time, the Leaf Genin coldly put
their mission first and left. Leaf Genin? So the accursed laws
have found their way deep into the hearts
of the younger generation… But it hasn't. They returned soon after to rescue the children, and us
even though they had no ties… They were good people. At least, at that moment they were… I feel they can become a force that will rouse the future
of shinobi. As for the Hidden Leaf
as an organization, we'll probably have to see
how they make their move. Good work. I want you to continue
your surveillance. That incident you were speaking of… Was it about my fellow genin
from the Leaf? Yes… What is your objective?! What are you trying to confirm? Would you like to find out with me? Like that man said… To see if those genin
can become a force… that can rouse the future of shinobi? D-Damn it! Chakra Points or whatever… It's sad that I can't move! If only I had more chakra, a jutsu like this would be easy to… Dad. I've got this thing called
the Nine Tails sealed inside me… And this is a huge problem! Naruto… I once told you, remember? I split the Nine Tails in two and
left half inside your mother and sealed the other half inside you.
And the reason was… Uh-huh… to save Mom's life,
because she's a Jinchuriki. Yes. But that wasn't all. Huh?! I sealed the other half of
the Nine Tails inside you because I had faith that you would be
able to master the use of its power. The Nine Tails' chakra will become
an immense power for you… as long as you can control it. But what's the purpose…
of such a power? One day, that power will
become necessary. When you are able to find
something precious that you really want to protect… I guarantee it. Something precious that I want
to protect with its power… Hey, you dumb fox!
Lend me your chakra again! Use your chakra and turn
my Chakra Points back to normal! What's the matter? Why aren't you answering me,
Nine Tails?! We'll rendezvous with Team Asuma
and Team Kurenai here. This spot will be easy to sense. But… Considering the time, Teams Asuma and Kurenai
have probably joined up. They should come
looking for us next. Even if it's just the two of us, shouldn't we head back
to the village? Lord Fourth didn't choose us
for this mission because of our fighting ability. He chose us merely because
the younger we are, the harder it is for the enemy
to use their jutsu on us. That's why he ordered us to return
to the village immediately without engaging as soon
as we scoped out the situation. Oh. We still haven't identified the enemy
and don't know how many there are, so it's bad to divide up
our fighting power. Then what about the others who
went to save their teammates? A shinobi puts priority
on the rules… and the orders given
under the rules… We can't be swayed
by compassion. Guy Sensei! Neji! Wait, Lee! What are you saying? We have to find Guy Sensei! But searching blindly
like this isn't… Blind or not,
I will find Guy Sensei! Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself! What? Unless I'm doing something,
I feel so uneasy and scared. And I end up thinking about all of
the bad things that can happen… Calm down… Your perseverance
is sure to pay off! You're right! It's okay! All I have to do
is persevere! Guy Sensei! Neji! Well, Kiba?! Will we be able to join up
with everyone? Lee's started running around again. I wonder if Tenten's with him. Yeah, she's right behind Lee. They're on the same team, but she must be going crazy
trying to keep up with Lee. True. What's Neji doing? If Neji's around, Lee won't be
able to do whatever he pleases. That's because… The thing is… I can't pick up on Neji's scent. No, Neji is there… Near Sasuke and Sakura. Is he alone? What about Naruto? I don't see Naruto. But…how can I put this… It feels like Neji is inside
something hazy… And there's someone next
to him. Are there any others? There's someone else lurking around
Sakura and Sasuke! Sasuke and Sakura are our comrades
from the Hidden Leaf. Then see for yourself
what they are really like. Sasuke? Be quiet… Is it Kiba and the others? Fire Style! Phoenix Flower Jutsu! I had you pegged as a brat who can't
stay still and loves to show off… Oh well, I don't like to wait,
so I guess we can start this. Who the hell are you? You can think of me
as a gatekeeper. I'm not letting you
go any further. Yes… We can't smell Neji, but there's no mistake that
there's another guy close to Sasuke. If you can't smell him, how can he
be seen with the Byakugan? What does it mean? I don't know, but it probably means
that the enemy is still detaining Neji. There's no mistake… Neji isn't trying to move out
of that haze. Then there's nothing
we can do by staying here. Hinata, lead the way. You got it. Let's go! Such annoying flies. Want me to smash them
with my fly swatter? The tip of the tail
could be poisoned! Guy Sensei! Neji! Naruto and the team captains! What's the matter?! Tenten! Run! This is bad! What are they? They must be the ones
who abducted Guy Sensei! We must capture them! We have to get away somehow, and move to a more suitable place
for close combat. Yeah, it's strange. Lee and Tenten's movements
seem irregular. What do you mean?! It could be a coincidence, but Lee and the others are heading
to where Sasuke is fighting. That's perfect! Let's hurry over there too! Right! Don't underestimate me… If a kunai won't work… Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! What the hell is he? Is he human? "Human…"? That's so boring. I'm my own masterpiece. Sasuke! This means…the poison! Sasuke! It just happened,
before I knew it. But killing one human
means nothing… You dumb fox! Why won't you answer me? Shut up! Nine Tails! Because it's impossible
for you right now. What's impossible? In order to break the immobilizing jutsu
applied to your Chakra Points, you need to be able to control
a massive amount of my chakra. But at this point,
you can't manage that. You don't know that until I try it. What? If that makes you mad, open up
the Eight Signed Seal and free me. Then I'll consider it. Dad's Eight Signed Seal? That's something I can't do yet. Summoning: Toad Mouth Trap! Pervy Sage! Wrong!

 Lady Tsunade?

 Jiraiya has absolutely no idea!

 Oh, you were just agitated
because of Jiraiya's novel…

 This is inexcusable!

 Even if it's just a novel,
you can't bend the truth!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Rules or a Comrade?"


 There's no way Sakura
would be this meek!


 JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS
THE TALE OF NARUTO THE HERO -
THE RULES OR A COMRADE?


 Tune in again!

 You're wrong! L-Lady Tsunade?! What's wrong?! Jiraiya doesn't understand
a thing! Oh, you were just worked up
over Jiraiya's novel… It's not funny!
This is inexcusable! Even if it's a novel,
you can't bend the truth! There's no way Sakura, my beloved pupil,
would be this meek! I brought you rice balls
for dinner, since I figured they'd be easier
to eat while you read… Please take a break. Is that so? That was quite
thoughtful of you. Salty! What is this? The picked plum
is ten years old. It's too salty! The tea's just been made
so it's very hot. Tell me sooner! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
"The Rules or a Comrade" The Hyuga's future,
rather the future of all shinobi, rests on this test. Watch carefully until the end. Their hidden selves will
soon be revealed. I won't let them be killed. How dare you! How dare you do
this to Sasuke! You're such a pain. Do you want to die too? Don't forget your purpose! Your orders were to uncover
their true selves… I didn't order you to kill them. So he was spying on me… I know. It's just a test, right? I'll prove to the shinobi
who's watching all of this… that there is no future! Cha! I removed all the poison. You'll be okay now. When did you learn
Medical Ninjutsu? I've been secretly apprenticing
with Lady Tsunade. Oh, really? Well, that saved my life. This is it? If that was the test,
what did it prove? No, there's more. And it's just about to begin. Your Chakra Points are clear now. You should be able to move. Th-Thanks, Pervy Sage. Take these pills…
They'll replenish your chakra. Okay. Why are you here, Pervy Sage? I've been searching for
a certain someone and came upon some intel, so I stopped by
the Hidden Leaf Village… I heard about what
was going on here and convinced Minato
to transport me here. I'm surprised he knew
where I was. Apparently, the seal that
Minato placed inside you also has a Marking. As long as you have the Marking, his jutsu can
get us to you instantly, no matter how far away you are. Aww Dad! By the way, how is everyone? Kakashi Sensei and the other captains
have been abducted. Neji and I were
locked up in here. Oh. And then what…? Neji went off with
a guy wearing a mask. And you saw the rest… Damn it! If I only had more power, I could've beaten up that
masked guy… and gone to save Kakashi Sensei
and the others! You've still have
a long ways to go. Damn it! Today's the last day
of this training. But even when I'm gone,
keep practicing by yourself. Do you remember the training
we did for the Summoning Jutsu? Yeah! Just the other day, I was falling toward the bottom
of the valley and almost died! But I was able to summon
the Great Toad! Is that so? Okay, try it again right here! All right! Summoning Jutsu! H-Huh? No…that's not good. I see you've been
ignoring your training. No! I've been doing
the training properly! And besides, Dad's been
training me separately too. The first step is…rotation… Why?! I sped up the rotation
of the water inside, but the water balloon won't break. That's it! If I just shake up the water
inside the balloon the way the cat did… Dad? I was able to do the first part! I got a hint from the way
a stray cat was playing with the water balloon! So teach me the next part! Hey, not so fast! How about a popsicle break? Huh? Okay… If I master up to step three, can you teach me
the Summoning Jutsu? If I don't know it by
the next time I see Pervy Sage, he's gonna get mad at me. With anything, you've got to
take it one step at a time. Yeah, I got it, Dad. I was able to summon the Great Toad
because of Dad's training… Even though it was only
that one time. And that's when I met Nine Tails
for the first time. Oh… All right… Why don't we try it! Huh?! I'll weaken the Eight Signed
Sealing Formula. Then the Nine Tails' Chakra
will be released. But…if you can't control
that power, the Nine Tails' will rob you
of your consciousness. I'll try it! Please do it! Hey, hey… Stop! Ouch! What's that for?! Look! No more paper shuriken
are coming at us. Huh? You're right. All signs of the enemy are gone… Or…something weird is going on… We were under such heavy attack… But we're uninjured. Y-Yes… Lee! Tenten! – Kiba!
– Everyone! We finally caught up to you! Where's the enemy? How many are there? Well… I saw with my Byakugan that you two were being attacked
and pursued… Well, you see… As soon as we got here, all signs of them
suddenly disappeared. Disappeared? Yes…almost as if
a fox spirited them away. Where is Neji? Naruto fell into the enemy's trap. And Neji went after him. Naruto too? Wait a minute. This scent… Sasuke and Sakura
should be nearby too! Byakugan! We must hurry! I see a shadowy, enemy-like figure
approaching them, but Sasuke and Sakura
seem unaware of it! Hey, hey! You promised! You're going to help me
train today right? Sorry, Sasuke… Lord Fourth just summoned me. I was looking forward to having you
watch me, Big Brother. Definitely next time. You should go ask Father
to help you today. Uh-huh. A-Amazing… This is the fundamental ninjutsu
of the Uchiha Clan… Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu. I've already shown you
the hand signs. Build up and infuse your chakra,
focus it at a point in your chest. Then release it in
one large breath. Yes, sir! Father is teaching me
the jutsu himself! Father finally acknowledges me! I can't disappoint him! I can do it! Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Why did I think
you would be like Itachi? It's too soon,
you're not ready yet. – Sakura!
– Yes! I wasn't able to inflict
a fatal wound with my attack… There is a limit to life. But, art is forever. Do you want to see… my everlasting army? Every one of them is
a truly valuable work of art that surpasses life. Secret Red Move: Performance
of a Hundred Puppets! One hundred puppets. All these puppets… This is impossible… Now, what are you going to do? Are you going to fight each
of my 100 pieces of art? Or will you just cower in fear? I will let you decide. He said he was the gatekeeper… If that's true… These guys are preventing us
from returning to the Hidden Leaf Village. And as long as
we don't try to pass them, they won't attack. Can Sakura and I take
on 100 puppets and make it through? That's close to impossible. However, if we had more
on our side… Everyone! Finally, we're able to rendezvous. We're going to hide
our presence for a while… What's going on? Are they puppets? Yeah, a hundred of them. On our side… There are ten including me…
plus a dog. What happened here? A puppet user brought them out
to create a blockade. A blockade? Where's the puppet user? He's watching to see what
our next move will be. Sasuke, what did you
first intend on doing? If we want Lord Fourth to
conduct a rescue mission, we have to return quickly to
the village and report back to him. But if we bring down
all 100 puppets here, we can get out of here. You sure make it sound easy. But it's not impossible…right? If we're going to complete
our mission, we have no other choice. Wait! We're not going back
to the village! We're not giving up on rescuing
the team captains. You plan on abandoning
the mission? No, that's not it. That's because there's also the option
of breaking up into two teams: one to look for the captains and
one to report back to the village. No… I also think we should stick together
and work as one team. What? Shikamaru!
What the hell are you—?! In the beginning, I agreed that we should break up
into two groups. But a lot of time has passed. We should keep into account
that the longer time passes, the less successful our chances of
finding Asuma and the others will be. Put simply, we don't have the time
to return to Hidden Leaf Village. Not to mention,
if we fight all those puppets, we'll exhaust all our time. Why did I think
you would be like Itachi? Well, Sasuke? Will you come with us? I'm not coming with you. I'll do things my way,
on my own. We were able to gather
the Leaf genin in one location… but things don't look so good. Are they arguing? Why? If they try to break through
that barrier of puppets, it would mean they chose
to stick to the rules and place priority on their mission. But… If they ignore the puppets
to go find their comrades… it will mean that nothing
could sway them and they made a choice of
their own free will… out of a desire to save their friends. When they finally coalesce into
a group of Hidden Leaf Shinobi, which option will they choose? What will they choose to do? That's when we'll see the true nature
of these young shinobi. Understand? When the Eight Signed Sealing
is weakened, I don't even know
what will happen! All right. But if worse comes to worst… I, Jiraiya, one of
the Legendary Sannin will stop it. I'll leave it to you! Three tails in no time! Naruto! Hold back your chakra
right there! What? The seal that keeps me
bound is weakening! Hey, demon-fox! Lend me your power! Strengthen your resolve! Use your will to control
the Nine Tails' Chakra! A fourth tail?! I guess it was still too soon
for Naruto to be able to control
the Nine Tails' Chakra… One of your apprentices
will prevent

 a great catastrophe
in the Ninja World.

 But if they go down
the wrong path,

 they will bring about great ruin.

 You said,
one of my apprentices?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Child of Prophecy."

 Impossible. To think the one who might
bring about great ruin is—?!



 Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Child of Prophecy



 Tune in again!


 What?
What happened?! Please wait a minute. I'll replace it right now. Thanks. Lady Tsunade,
are you going to stay here? Yes, just a little longer. It's not good for your health,
so please don't overdo it. I know… Lord Jiraiya put his heart
and soul into this work… I don't blame her for
getting so absorbed in it. Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Child of Prophecy



Hmm... A fourth tail?! I guess it was still too soon for Naruto to be able to control
the Nine Tails' Chakra… SUPPRESS

I have no choice but to lock
the Eight Signed Seal once more. Naruto… Stay quiet just for a little while. Art of the Raging Lion's Mane! SUPPRESS I think I broke a few ribs. Summoning:
Bring Down the House Jutsu! Earth Style: The Dark Swamp! Naruto! Take back your self! Naruto! SAGE Jiraiya-boy. The Great Lord Elder
had a dream about you. As you know, it is a prophecy. Listen closely. Yes, sir! I shall now tell you… In my dream,
you, who are solely pervy, will still manage to become
a splendid shinobi. And in time,
you will have your own disciples… "Solely pervey"? I can't believe he just
remembers that particular detail… One such disciple will come to
possess a great power. Depending on how you guide him, the future of the Shinobi World
will undergo a great change. I'm going to guide him? Furthermore,
it is your disciple who will influence the future of
the Shinobi World greatly. My disciple is? Yes… The future of the Shinobi World will
be wrought with many calamities. And one of your disciples will be the one who will
cast away those calamities. However… If they are guided
in the right direction, the world will change for the good. If they are guided
in the wrong direction, they will bring about great ruin. You are the one who will
guide the Child of Prophecy in the right direction. The Child of Prophecy? Impossible… To think the one who might
bring about great ruin is—?! Do you all plan on ignoring
the rules of the village? Yeah. We can't return to the village when our friends are
being held captive. We all agree on that. Why did I think
you would be like Itachi? Perhaps it's still too soon for you. Sasuke… Itachi was able to perfectly master it
when he was about your age. And currently, Itachi has been
appointed to the ANBU, under Lord Hokage's
direct supervision. The Leaf Police Force upholds
the laws of the village… and I was hoping to fill the void
left by Itachi's transfer… Focus! I won't lose to Big Brother! To honor the rules,
I'll destroy the puppets! I see… A smokescreen… Sasuke! He created a blind spot
for the puppet user! That was so reckless! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! So I guess it won't be that easy… Even if our goals differ,
we can't ignore our friends! Everyone, follow Lee! Human Boulder!
Roll! Roll! Roll! Cha! Fang Over Fang! Sasuke! I hope you didn't charge at
the puppets by yourself, because you knew full well that
we don't leave our friends behind… They attacked the puppets… Do they intend on
bringing down the puppets, and then return to Leaf Village? Did they choose the rules
over their friends? Even the young ones cannot
break free of the curse of rules. After all, a caged bird is a caged bird. They don't know how to fly freely
through the heavens. Has your Byakugan become cloudy? What?! They're not fighting because
they want to honor the rules… They're fighting for their friend. They're not bound by the rules… By their own will, they're fighting
to save their friend. I guess this is far enough. They've already decided. It's pretty obvious… There's no future for shinobi. There is only…hell. Let me show you an artistic
and eternal hell! Damn it! He had spare puppets! You said there are three steps
in the training…right, Dad? You've only taught me two. That's right. Now then… This is an ordinary balloon. The first step is rotation. The second step is force. I'm able to do up to there. And the third step is… The one in my right palm
looks like an ordinary balloon, right? Y-Yeah… If you reproduce the contents of
the balloon with your right hand… Amazing! Massive chakra revolves erratically…
and it goes faster and faster… But the balloon remains
perfectly round. Namely, the chakra in the second step
which was infused with force, is fixed inside the balloon. "Fixed"? As you put force into the chakra,
you compress it and fix it. Huh?! It's hard enough making it turn and
adding force with both hands! You can increase it even more?! I guess you could use all
the extra help you can get! But if you can do this… Whoa! Awesome! This Rasengan is
a super high-level ninjutsu. Only two shinobi can do this:
Jiraiya Sensei and I. Do you think I'll be able to do it too? Yeah! I'm sure you will! Oh yeah…
"all the extra help, I can get." Damn it! What's going on? There's no end to this in sight! Sakura! Wait! I'm coming to save you! Naruto?! Pervy Sage?! You're back. How did you get hurt?! It's nothing, don't worry. But I can't move,
so I'm going back for now. So you'd better get back
to the others. Reverse Summoning Jutsu! What, what?! Ouch! This isn't good.
At this rate, they'll be… – Wait!
– But?! The way things are going,
the Hidden Leaf shinobi are in danger. No…
I sense massive chakra… Why did this turn into such a drag?
I'm such an idiot! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rotation! Force! And with some "extra help,"
I can fix it! What is that?! Look at the chakra! That jutsu…
It's the Rasengan! Impossible!
That's because that jutsu is… Naruto's amazing! Naruto! Here I go! Rasengan! What?! Next one…
Let's go! Here we go! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto?! Damn you…
You ruined my art! Are you the Puppet User?! Damn it! He got away… That was amazing, Naruto! Taking down all those puppets,
by yourself. I think I might have
underestimated you all this time. Yeah!
You were hiding some amazing power! That power has to be acknowledged. That's because, everyone had
a tough time with the enemy, but you came and
took them down by yourself. As one would expect of Naruto! I was totally surprised! They say skilled hawks
hide their talons… I hate to admit it, but this is the one time
I have to acknowledge him. But the way, Naruto… We're going to save our friends. It will mean disobeying
the rules of the village… But that's what we all want. Yeah…Of course,
I feel the same way. What will you do, Sasuke?! With this much fighting strength, you can't say rescuing
our friends is impossible. Sasuke, come with us! Whatever. All right! It's decided! Everyone, you heard it!
We've joined up. We're going to rescue Asuma and… no, we're going to find our friends
and rescue them! – All right!
– All right! Has your so-called test
produced a result? I believe it's already been proven that
they consider the bonds of friendship more important than
the rules of the village. So there's no need to
continue this test. You will release all the Hidden Leaf
Shinobi you've abducted, right? Father? Who are you?

 We are not your enemies.

 First of all, we have to show you
a sign of mutual trust.

 We apologize for
getting you involved

 in the test that
our employer devised!

 The test is over.
We'll release your friends.

 Are you telling the truth?

 JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS:
THE TALE OF NARUTO THE HERO-
THE CAGED BIRD



 Tune in again!

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,270
You really don't have
any manners do you, child? When you address someone
who's higher-ranking than you... it's common courtesy
to show your face. <i>He's covered with wounds...</i> Looks like it's over... Naruto! <i>The Secret of the Battle!


</i> All right... I'll listen to you. To tell the truth, ever since the Destruction
of the Leaf incident, Danzo has been yearning... for an opportunity to come in contact
with you, Lord Orochimaru. <i>His wounds are slow to heal...</i> <i>Up to now,</i> <i>Naruto has always been a fast healer
<i>using the Nine-Tailed Chakra...</i> Naruto, being in
the Nine-Tail's state ... At first glance, it appears that
he is being protected by the Nine-tail's Cloak created
by the Chakra... But in actuality, his body is continuing to suffer damage
from the Nine-tail's Cloak After the fourth tail formed, his body, wrapped in
the Nine-Tail's Cloak, grew bloodied... and he thrashed about
despite suffering serious injuries. <i>The fourth tail that Jiraiya
<i>was talking about...</i> <i>I wouldn't have imagined that
<i>it would be as powerful as this...</i> Captain Yamato... That Jutsu that stopped Naruto
earlier on... Would you teach me that Jutsu...? That's not possible... The only person in the Leaf Village
who can use that Jutsu is me, since I inherited the First Hokage's cells. What that Jutsu does is
forcibly suppress the Nine-Tail's Chakra... It's impossible for someone
without that special power to use it. My power, which is just
an experimental copy, is certainly not on the same level as
the First Hokage's original. What Naruto has hanging around
his neck is something that belonged to the First Hokage... It's a Chakra crystal that
only resonates to the First Hokage's Chakra. With that necklace,
one can control a Jinchuriki's Chakra. It is said that this power is
the very reason that the First Hokage
became the Hokage. And it's also the reason that I was chosen to be
the Captain of this team... It's always like this... All I can ever do for Naruto... are the smallest things. It's not important whether
the things you do are large or small. What's important... is the magnitude of the feelings
you have for Naruto. Sakura... I can tell that when
I look at you. You truly... S-Sakura... Owww! Naruto...! What happened to me...? I was chasing that jerk Orochimaru...
and then... And then, what did I do after that? Hey, Sakura... Huh? Why are you crying, Sakura? I just got something in my eyes... That acid-tongued Sai said something
abusive to you again, right? Like, "You're ugly!" Or, "You're Herculean!" That jerk! Sai hasn't called me Herculean...! R-Really? Don't make up stuff...
You jerk! By the way...
Captain Yamato... Where's Sai? That's everything that Danzo
asked me to convey. That's extremely interesting... And...about that story... Why should I believe it? What's going on here? Just calm down...Kabuto. That child is going to be one of
our subordinates starting today. Can you trust...this guy...? Look inside that envelope. It's for you, from Danzo. This is... What does it say? Kabuto, let go of that child We're taking that child along with us. Sai...was it? Shall we go then...? Just as I thought... Captain Yamato? Sai is... Wait a moment... <i>The bridge...</i> I did plant one on him back at
the hot springs, just in case... Oh well. I'll continue
the pursuit as is. I might not look it, but pursuit is actually one of
my strong points. Captain Yamato... Oh yeah... Right now, Sai is... traveling together with Orochimaru. Together with...? What does that mean? Both of you follow me. The earth is still soft. The bridge is busted... and this place is in
such an awful state... What the heck...happened? Don't you remember? <i>So it's just as
<i>Master Jiraiya said, huh...?</i> <i>His anger becomes the trigger...</i> <i>And as the number of Fox Spirit tails
<i>he grew increased,</i> <i>he maintained consciousness
<i>up until the third tail.</i> <i>But by the fourth tail,
<i>he had lost all rationality...</i> <i>and was controlled
<i>by destructive impulses.</i> Come to think of it... why was I unconscious? You were unconscious because
you got creamed by Orochimaru. Are you serious?!
Damn! Sai's things are scattered
all over the place... But why is this here...? <i>A picture book...
<i>This looks interesting...</i> <i>Hey, can I take a look at it
<i>along the way?</i> <i>No, you can't...
<i>It's not finished yet...</i> <i>and I never hand it over
<i>to anyone as a matter of policy.</i> <i>Because this belonged
<i>to my elder brother.</i> Sai valued this picture book... But despite that,
here it is in a place like this. If he had to leave something
so valuable behind, it demonstrates that he was in
a tense state in front of Orochimaru. You seem to know that as if
you witnessed it yourself. Until earlier on... I placed my Wood Clone here, and
was in communication with it, using the wireless radio
implanted here. What happened to Sai? After Sai's...conversation
with Orochimaru, he went away with Orochimaru
and Kabuto. What does that mean?! What did they talk about? They were talking a distance away... so I couldn't make out
the conversation. I wonder what
they were talking about? He might have been kidnapped
and taken away. No, it seems that he approached
Orochimaru of his own volition... and handed him something. It was just like he was trying
to cozy up to Orochimaru... W-Wait a minute! Even a disgusting guy like him
wouldn't betray us, would he? No, there is a possibility... <i>A long time ago,</i> <i>he competed with
<i>the late Sarutobi Sensei...</i> <i>over the position of
<i>the Third Hokage.</i> <i>Unlike the Third Hokage,</i> <i>he's the leader of
<i>a hard-line military faction...</i> <i>based on rigid logic...
<i>and is Sai's superior.</i> <i>He hates me because...</i> <i>I'm the granddaughter
<i>of the First Hokage...</i> <i>as well as a student of
<i>the Third Hokage who was moderate...</i> Captain Yamato, do you know
a person named Danzo...? Yes, I know him. Who is...that guy? A man from the Hawk Faction who
in the past opposed the Third Hokage. He's Sai's boss... And an old gramps who doesn't
think well of the Third Hokage's will. Danzo may be using Sai to make
some kind of move. It's possible that... Sai may have been given
a mission... by Danzo that is separate from ours... There is a possibility that
he was charged... with some kind
of top-secret mission... So he's just using our mission... in order to make contact
with Orochimaru?! That's the gist of it. This may sound like
an over-the-top theory... but it is not outside the realm
of possibility...so listen carefully. Danzo... may be trying to destroy
the Hidden Leaf Village! Lord Orochimaru... I already know that, Kabuto. It looks like we're being followed. I wonder whether
we're simply being followed... or whether that guy, Sai,
is a conspirator. Are you suspecting him? After all, I don't trust him yet. Well, whatever the case,
we can't split up right now. In other words... we may need a corpse, right,
Kabuto? Next time:
"The Consequences of Betrayal" Has your so-called test
produced a result? I believe it's already been proven that
they consider the bonds of friendship more important than
the rules of the village. Hmm… So there's no need to
continue this test. You will release all the Hidden Leaf
Shinobi you've abducted, right…? Father? What?
The Masked Man is Neji's—?! I figured it was about time
you'd want this… How thoughtful of you! Here you go. Whoa… That sure hits the spot! All right, the continuation… Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Caged Bird



 That's fine… Where are you keeping everyone? I trust they're safe… Of course. I'll have the three lead you
to them immediately. You can go and gather everyone. All right. I have to tie up some loose ends,
I'll join you afterwards. You got that, everyone? We're joining up as one team to look for Asuma, I mean our friends,
and rescue them! Right! All right, let's get going! Hold it, Naruto. What is it? You're the one who said
we're going to rescue our friends! Yeah, I did. But we don't even know
where they are. Not even one clue… Unless, Naruto,
you have intel that we don't. Yeah, yeah! You think I'd have
that kind of intel? – Huh?
– Huh? Your fighting skills
may've improved slightly, but your brain's still the same. What?! Hey! Stop fighting! I guess that's
the Tracking Team's cue… I don't think you'll be needed… Huh?! Neji, I'm glad you're safe. Sorry to have worried you. What happened to the enemy? – Did you bring him down?
– No. You let him get away? No, that's not it, but… Then what happened? Naruto!
Give Neji a chance to speak. Damn it. Oh, okay… So? What's going on, Neji? Finally, we're up. I've been bored to death. The test is over. So I'm dismissing the mercenaries. You can't do that. Take a look. My art has been damaged and
you expect me to just leave? Everything is complete. I was able to verify the truth.
You're dismissed. Huh? Hey wait, partner! The job's complete. Once we get paid, we're done. Guess it can't be helped. Huh?! Huh?! H-Hey! Wait a second! I'd like you to tie up
some loose ends. "Loose ends" you say? Help the evacuated villagers
return to their homes. We'll be happy to do that. And there's one more thing
I'd like to request… Anyway, that's it. So you're saying everything
that happened was just an experiment
by this masked man? Hold on! Guy Sensei and the others
are safe? Yeah. He promised he'd free
all the hostages and lead us to them. "Lead us to them"? What does that mean? Who the hell are you guys?! We're not your enemy. First of all, we want to show you
a sign of mutual trust. We apologize for getting you
involved in our employer's test. The test is over. Your friends will be freed. Are you serious? We are Hidden Rain Shinobi. We travel around the land
in search of those who share our vision for
the future of the shinobi world. We're Team Jiraiya. Team Jiraiya?! You guys know Pervy Sage? Yes. He saved our lives and
he was our ninjutsu master. I get it now. When we were attacked,
I didn't sense any malice. Because it was just a test. So, did we pass the test? I believe so. That's why we're telling you
where your friends are. Konan. Shinobi Ageha Butterflies… The butterflies will guide you
to your friends. We must go return
the villagers to their homes. So we'll be leaving. Hold it. Damn it! I wanted to hear more
about Pervy Sage. So we just follow…them? Neji… Shinobi Ageha Butterflies… They're over there! That structure, huh? All right!
Let's go save everyone! Wait! There could be traps— He's not even listening. Damn it. Everyone! This is embarrassing. Guy Sensei,
I'm so glad you're okay. Oh! I'm super-overcome
with emotion! To be rescued by my pupil
is more than I ever deserve… Ouch! Can you be a little gentler? But it's just a scratch. Asuma… Are you hurt anywhere? No… Sorry we made you worry. I'm so relieved. Anyway, what was this incident
all about anyway? Are you guys able
to explain it to us? Y-Yeah. Allow me to me explain. Wait. He's no longer our enemy!
It's all right. Okay, then. No way…You're—! You're…Hizashi Hyuga… Impossible… You're supposed to have died
when I was three years old… What? Well, let me explain that part. Neji… When Lady Hinata
was three years old, a major crisis hit
the Hidden Leaf Village. Shinobi from the Hidden Cloud
attempted to kidnap you… but Lord Hiashi killed them. The Hidden Cloud was at fault. Naturally, relations became strained
and the threat of war loomed. In order to prevent fighting, the Hidden Leaf secretly negotiated
with the Hidden Cloud and accepted their conditions. Rather, they had no choice
but to accept. What was the condition? The head of the Hyuga who possessed
the Kekkei Genkai, the Byakugan. In other words, they demanded
the Leaf hand over the corpse of Lady Hinata's father,
Hiashi Hyuga. And so,
Hiashi Hyuga's younger twin, my father Hizashi Hyuga
became his stand-in… and peace in the village
was maintained. As for my father's decision and
the circumstances behind that, you saw it for yourself, Naruto. The terrible system
of the Curse Mark that's been passed down within the Hyuga
to protect the Main Family. We are alive, but are unable to
change the currents of fate. What you saw was my father,
who by his own will, chose to defy his fate. Kakashi… This has caused everyone
much stress. You're supposed to be dead,
so how—? At first,
I didn't understand either. But after a long slumber,
I awakened… …and found myself within
a certain man's hideout. You have been revived
thanks to my Reanimation Jutsu. But it was also because your heart
still had attachments to this world. I have no attachments.
I wanted to die… …for the sake of the clan. It was your wish to
give up your life, you say? But if your death was in vain… Perhaps that man was right. I did feel that way at the time. That is why I planned
this incident. I hoped that my death
was not in vain… That my death would
provide the impetus… for the Hidden Leaf Village
to rethink the cruel rules and destinies
which took away my life… Well, all that doesn't
matter anymore. I'm a man who should
not exist in this world. However, it seems I cannot
undo this jutsu myself. I want you to return to the village and
look into how to release this jutsu. But before that… I would like to speak
with my son Neji, alone. Neji, do you remember that day? Neji… You must survive. You have been blessed with
the gifts of the Hyuga, more so than anyone else
in the clan. How I wish you had been
born into the main family. Although it was to protect
the village, our clan, and you, the result of defying
the fate of the Hyuga, has brought you nothing
but sadness. On top of that,
I was worried about your future, tied as it was to
the Hyuga's destiny. Yes. It was only natural,
having lost you, I used that as motivation
to live every day resenting and cursing
my destiny as a Hyuga. But meeting a certain genin
changed my way of thinking. I'm destined to bear the burden
of a mark I can never remove… How can you possibly
even understand?! I do understand. And, so what of it? Quit trying to show off. You're not the only one
who's special. Everyone is desperate to
defy their own destiny. You're no different. I'm definitely gonna bring you down
and prove it to you! The Hyuga destiny of whatever
that you despise… If it's too much for you, then forget about it and
don't do anything. When I become the Hokage… I'll change…the Hyuga! Naruto Uzumaki taught me. That even a caged bird,
if it's smart enough, will use its beak
to open the latch… Because it wants to fly
free across the sky. In any case, maybe I'll end up
in the same place. But when people have a choice, they can strive hard towards
their goal in life. And, for someone to have that,
means they are truly strong. And Father… I have just one goal. To become stronger. To become someone who
cannot be defeated. That's how I feel right now. You've made a wonderful friend… Neji. Although right now, he's a rival… Father! Seems like we don't need to find
a way to release the jutsu. Yeah. You've grown up well. Father! Father… Guy… It seems Hizashi's greatest regret was not being able to
guide you into adulthood. Yes. I'm glad the villagers are back home
and peace has returned to this village. Yes. So what do we do now? Are you thinking of joining up
with the Hidden Leaf Genin? Yeah… Although we're from different villages,
I feel like we can call them comrades. Perhaps the day will come
when we'll team up with them. Nagato, what's that? Doesn't it belong
to those children? I found it on the road
to the village. It was chaotic,
with everyone trying to get home, and they probably dropped it. They're probably making a big fuss
about their missing stuffed animal. All right,
I'll go return it to them. Yahiko… I'll be right back. Wait here. All right! Let's hurry home,
so I can report to Dad. All right then Naruto,
let's race back to the village. I won't lose! Neither will I! I said I'm not gonna lose! Same here! Me too! Me! Where does all that
energy come from? Really… Hey, wait. My body's still not… W-Why don't we rest a bit? Oh boy… What? What is going on? Yahiko… Nagato… Damn it, Jiraiya!

 Why did he write something that
leaves such a bad aftertaste?

 I need to know how
the story continues…

 I thought you might like
a little something for tea…

 Perhaps this was a bad time?

 No, not at all!
I was feeling a little hungry…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:



 "Returning Home."



 All right, the continuation!



 JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS:
THE TALE OF NARUTO THE HERO-
RETURNING HOME



 Tune in again!

 What a nice day… But… Damn that Jiraiya! Why'd he write a story with
such a bad ending? I need to know how
the story continues… Oh… I thought you might like
a little something for tea… Perhaps this was a bad time? No, not at all! I was feeling a little hungry… Oh good. Please eat. These are mugwort dumplings
from Amaguriama. There's nothing like something sweet
to wake up a tired mind! Okay, continuing on. PART TWO
 Thanks to your efforts,
the mission was successful. Good job! Is what I'd like to say… But that's not quite
the case, is it? I'm very sorry. I'm the one
who disobeyed orders first. Please punish me
as you see fit. Neji, you aren't the only one at fault. He's right! If you put it like that,
I was the first… But…we had no choice at the time. But breaking the rules
is breaking the rules. But–! Hey, this isn't the place to argue. There's no doubt they may
have acted carelessly. But their cleverness saved us.
That's a fact. Please go easy on them. Well, since you put it like that… Disobeying orders cannot
be overlooked. But there are special circumstances
in all missions. Decisions must be made depending
on the situation at hand, and you must make
the best possible choice. In this case, everyone joined together to
make the mission a success. That has to be factored
into the evaluation. Lord Fourth, does that mean…? That no one is at fault…
I suppose. Yes! Way to go! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
Returning Home.
 
 
 I thought he was gonna
give it to us! I guess Lord Hokage has
a soft spot for family members. Are you still stuck on that? I still don't acknowledge you. Let it go already. We got off easy and it's over. Still, Naruto, you were amazing. Yeah, I see you in
a different light now. Yes, you really trained hard, Naruto. Well, yeah, I guess. Anyway, let's go get something
to eat and talk about it! So ridiculous. Hey, are you leaving? Oh, just let him go. It's barbecue time! What is with that guy? LEAF HOSPITAL

I said no visitors!
And you push your way in. You always overreact. The situation is under control. Still, I'm just worried. I'm sorry. My son is to blame. Don't worry about it. An injury like this is nothing. Even though he's still a bit clumsy, I can't believe how Naruto controlled
the Nine Tails' Chakra… Perhaps he really is
the "Child of Prophecy" that I've been searching for. You think he's that big of a deal? But we can't rest easy. There's still that one issue. Orochimaru… When I found his hideout… I found you, Orochimaru. I can't believe you would actually
come all this way… Orochimaru, your appearance! What in the…? Oh this… I just obtained
a new body. Don't tell me you hijacked
someone else's body? My goal is for perpetual youth
and longevity. To be young,
strong and beautiful. It's what everyone yearns for. But this is just a temporary vessel. In three years, which is when I'll be able to
use this jutsu again, I'll find a body
that's even more beautiful. Not likely.
Your scheme ends here! Earth Style! The Dark Swamp! Too bad, I've already seen
through your tricks. What? He got away! I'm not giving up. If I look around, maybe I'll find
some clues to his next move… This is–! I have to let Minato
know right away. Damn it! Summoning Jutsu! From that scroll, there's no doubt
that Orochimaru was involved in this recent incident… But we don't know what
to expect out of this. In any case,
we should be vigilant. Well then, I'd better do
what I can on my side. Excuse me. Minato seems as busy as ever. Well, we can't say the Hidden Leaf Village
is completely at peace. We were able to quell
a coup d'état by the Uchiha, but we haven't gotten to
the root of the problem yet. But Minato intends to use this as an opportunity to
confront them directly. Oh? So disobeying orders got you
involved in unnecessary trouble. Nearly everyone in
the Uchiha Clan is a respected member of
the Leaf Police Force. This sets a bad example. Well… There was someone
who acted recklessly! Not being able to stop him
shows your inability. Yes. You must be aware that this is
a crucial time for the Uchiha. Your older brother would
have done better. Excuse me. I'm back, Father. Oh, I've been waiting for you, Itachi. Did I interrupt? It's all right. Tell me what
you have to report. I'll excuse myself. BARBE-Q
 Delish! There's nothing like barbecue
after a mission. Damn Sasuke…
Acting stuck up… Well, he could just be really busy… Damn it, we can't let
Naruto show us up! Let's train hard from
now on too, Akamaru. Still, this incident left
a bad aftertaste, didn't it? Who would have thought
it would end like that… I don't get them! Those guys said the stupid test
was over… And that they needed to take
the villagers back to their homes. I can't believe
they blew up the entire village. The children we rescued
were there too. Perhaps they were erasing evidence? If that's the case,
they're horrible! They don't deserve to
call themselves Team Jiraiya… If I see them again,
they're gonna pay! That's right! We'll get them for sure! Right, Shikamaru? Y-Yeah… Father's right.
If Naruto hadn't acted on his own… Shiro… Come to think of it… He rescued you. But it's different this time. We were in the middle of
a mission. We were lucky it went well. But even still,
everyone's too easy on the guy. Did Father lecture you again? Well, it's nothing new. I see. But think of it this way… It's because
Father has high hopes for you. Also, our clan is in
a precarious position right now. We attempted
a dangerous coup d'état… and forced the Hokage
to accept our conditions. We can't afford to give him
any opportunity to reverse that. Ever since the rebellion
by our ancestor Madara, this ability of ours has been feared, and we were banished far
from the central government. In order to change our situation… But can we trust them to
keep their promise? Don't worry. That's why I've been assigned
to watch the Hokage. Big Brother… In time, you and I will be
the ones to support the Uchiha Clan. In order to protect our future, I intend to find out what
the Fourth is really thinking. So you have to hang in there too. Big Brother is amazing! So I'm not about to let a guy
like that outdo me either! Teach me a new jutsu. What a surprise!
It's rare to see you so eager. I need to get stronger. And I need to learn
a definitive jutsu for that. Well then, I have just
the perfect jutsu. When combined with
the foresight of the Sharingan, it culminates into a penetrating
technique of lightning speed. In other words,
the Chidori, huh? Even though we just got back
from a mission, Sasuke's really working hard! What are you saying? Not missing a moment to
start training on a new jutsu is just Sasuke for you. You guys should be
more like him! What a drag. Hey, is that true? Is Sasuke learning a new jutsu? Yeah. He's with Kakashi Sensei right now
at the training grounds. Seriously?! Damn it! He's getting a leg-up on me! Hey, don't get all excited. After all, you just mastered
an amazing jutsu yourself. Sorry, I'll see you guys later! I told them, no visitors! Come on…move over, will you? What's all the racket? I want you to train me, Pervy Sage! What brought this on
all of a sudden? Whatever, okay. I have to take it easy
for a while anyway. I'll watch over your training a little. – All right!
– Jiraiya! Hey, Sasuke! What do you want? I came to tell you that
I'm starting my training too! What? You're pretty dense, aren't you? I'm saying that you'll have
to acknowledge me when I master a new jutsu
before you do! How stupid. What did you say?! I don't consider you competition. I have much higher goals. I'll make you take back
those words! I swear it! Hey, Naruto! Sorry to interrupt! What's he so worked up about? I don't know. Anyway, let's continue. It's unlike you to pick a fight. Who cares? This gets me more fired up! So he's the kid you don't
want to lose to? Just watch me, Sasuke! I won't lose. And I'm going to get Father to
acknowledge me as soon as possible! Focus more! And pull out the Nine Tails
chakra with authority! Did you hurt yourself? No, it's nothing. Let me continue. Sasuke's training looks terrifying. I'm kinda scared. Dummy! That's what makes it
so cool! Those guys are such a drag. Is this the report on
the Uchiha incident? I expected opposition
from the advisors, but I didn't think there would be
such an uproar from the other clans. Everyone is afraid. That clan has
a history of betrayal, and they tend to keep
to themselves. Coupled with their keen abilities,
they just appear more suspicious. There are also
the lingering suspicions surrounding the coup d'état
we just prevented. But we can't go back on our promise. I know that. But the governing body can't ignore the voices of opposition
when it's this strong. We'll just have to keep trying
to persuade them. Anyway, so that's the gist of it. Can you give us
a little more time? I beg your pardon…
I overheard you. I'm sorry I wasn't able
to accomplish much. No…
I'm actually a bit surprised. I thought it was just
an empty promise that you had no intention
of keeping. You're not the type to be fooled
by something like that. Besides, I want to prevent
any calamity that falls within my range of power. When Master Jiraiya was
on Mount Myoboku, he was given a prophecy. That the Shinobi World will
be wrought with many calamities… And among Master Jiraiya's pupils
is a "Child of Prophecy" who is destined
to cast them away… in order to lead the world
in a better direction. Does that refer to Naruto? I don't know.
Sensei has many pupils. I'm also one of them. In any case, villages plagued
with problems will be vulnerable. For my son and your younger brother…
For the next generation… I want to leave them
a peaceful village. It's taking shape considerably. It better be. I can't stop now. With the state you're in,
we should call it a day. We can resume tomorrow. They're so carefree. Listen, Naruto. This Rasengan is merely
the foundation. With further practice,
it can evolve into new jutsu. Father… Oh, it was just you. I've been practicing a new jutsu. Is that so? Good for you. I guess he's not interested. That's not it. At this level, my jutsu isn't
worth the time for Father, who's responsible for
the entire Uchiha Clan… As expected… I'm amazed at how
you picked it up so quickly. That's because I'm an Uchiha. This jutsu can definitely compete
with that one. But–! However... I will surpass him! Kakashi, how far can I make
this Chidori evolve? Normally, one would just be happy… But this is just so like you. So, what's the answer? Frankly, the Lightning Style consumes
an enormous amount of chakra. For someone like me who
doesn't have lots of chakra, this is the limit. So it's impossible? I didn't say that. But taking it any further will
be extremely difficult. I brought some refreshments!
Let's have some together.

 You're being a nuisance!

 What are you doing?
Apologize to Sakura, now!

 Don't order me around.
A loser has no right to talk…

 I'm not a loser!

 I've already caught up to you!

 Us? Equals?
Impossible.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

to a test right now?

 Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:

The Mutual Path


 I'll soon reach the limit
of the Chidori's destructive power. I just need to make it
evolve nicely… But how? Father! What's the use if I can't
even ask him for advice? I've made up my mind
to surpass him. Father, do you have some time? I'm busy right now.
Come back later. Big Brother… Join us. I have something
important to discuss. And have you made up
your mind? Yes, Father. It's what I've decided after working closely
with Lord Fourth. It seems he is serious about changing the way
the Uchiha are treated. I want to believe him. I see. However… That means that
we must change too. We've put too much distance
between everyone else and us. That has become an obstacle
to a settlement. And? What are your thoughts? We have to show them
that we have no ill will. As a clan who is
part of this village, we must pledge loyalty
to Lord Fourth and aggressively do
our best to cooperate— So they'll accept
our conditions only if we show them obedience?! No, that's not the case. This is just
my personal observation. That's just too convenient… Be quiet, Sasuke. This is Itachi talking here… I'm sure he came to this conclusion
after careful thought. But—! Besides, we have long desired
to participate in government. Originally, our ancestors
chose to live here after fighting in wars that
sought blood for blood. We must strive to
find common ground. Thank you. You always do this, Father! Anyway, this is sudden, but… I've been given a request
from the Hokage. You're quite cunning… First, you make sure
I'm in an amenable mood… A mission to guard an official from
the Feudal Lord's office, a VIP. It's a direct request
from the Feudal Lord. The Hidden Leaf will
be dispatching an escort unit. It will be a long-term mission. If we accept this mission,
failure is not an option. Let's immediately go
through selections. It's always like this. Father only sees Big Brother. No matter how hard I try… Why did I think
you would be like Itachi? Your older brother would
have done better. This is Itachi talking here… I'm sure he came to this conclusion
after careful thought. Every single time! He never acknowledges me! See? Didn't I tell you, Naruto? Sasuke's mastered Chidori. You're right! I said it to him first,
but he's surpassed me! Sasuke… I brought some refreshments.
Let's have some together! You're being a nuisance! Sasuke… What are you doing?! Apologize to Sakura, now! Don't order me around. A loser has no right to talk… I'm not ordering you! And I'm not a loser! I've already caught up to you! You just can't accept it! Why you—! Don't be so stuck-up! You, equal to me?
Impossible. Do you wanna put that
to a test right now? Fine. Hey, you guys, stop it! Naruto! Sasuke! Stop! Dad? Sorry, but fights are
forbidden inside the village. Lord Fourth! Thank you. I'm so sorry, Sakura… Where is he—?! Ouch! Sasuke! What is that power?! How did he—? I'll never accept you. I promise
I'll knock you down! I didn't formulate the Rasengan
to hurt my friends. Why did you do that? I was frustrated. I've always tried
to catch up to him. But he refuses to acknowledge me. People's feelings
are complicated. But… But… I'm never gonna give up. Even if it's impossible now, I'm gonna become much stronger… I'm gonna get him to
acknowledge me someday! I thought you were listening
to our conversation the other day. So you're going to
criticize me again without even asking about
the circumstances? What are your intentions? Nothing. I'm just not going to expect
anything from you anymore. I've decided I'm going
to follow my own path. "Your own path"? Yeah, that's right. And right now, I want power. I have just one request
for you. All right! I'm gonna train hard
again today! What is all this racket,
this early in the morning? Okay, here I go! Naruto… Sakura? What's the matter? It's awful. Sasuke's—! Is it true, Dad? Sasuke's leaving our team?! Yes, it's true. Mr. Fugaku came by
a little earlier to inform me. Sasuke will be joining
the Leaf Police Force from today. Why so suddenly? What's going to happen
to our team? To Team 7? Well… I'm gonna go ask him myself! Hold on. Just hold on. What's the big idea? Sasuke has already left
for the Feudal Lord's office. The Uchiha have taken
on a long-term escort mission. It's the Uchiha's Elite Unit. Sasuke wants to shadow and learn from
the more experienced shinobi. It seems he made
a strong appeal to join them. Sasuke did? That's…way too sudden. We haven't even made
amends yet. You're such an idiot. You should be
a little happy for him. Why should I? He volunteered for
this mission in order to hone his skills. He probably made up
his mind right after fighting with you
and realizing something. Then, he also—?! Right. Like you,
he "doesn't want to lose." At least it means
he's aware of you. I see. This isn't the time to relax. Sasuke will become
ridiculously strong, and when he comes back,
he'll crush you and defeat you. No! That's not good! I have to train too! Hurry! I have to start right now! All right, that's the spirit. I'll be rooting you
from distant skies. H-Hold on, y'know! What you just said… Aren't you gonna
help me train, Pervy Sage?! My wounds are completely healed. I have to set out in search
of Orochimaru soon. No way! Don't get so depressed. I'll watch over your training
when I have a chance. But you're always so busy, Dad! Hey… Why don't you
take me with you? What?! You want to go
on the journey too? It's the perfect idea! I'll get lots of training
on the road! Well, uh… Jiraiya Sensei? I don't mind. But I wonder what
Kushina will say. She's really strict
when it comes to The Three Prohibitions
of the Shinobi and whatever… Well, we just have
to convince her! C'mon! Let's go! You're so self-centered… U-Um… BELIEVE

So that means…
Naruto is leaving the team too? I'm so sorry. I'll start looking into where
you can transfer to, so… No… I don't mind being on call. But… When Naruto returns,
we'll have our old team back. And even with Sasuke, there's a chance he might
have a change of heart. I understand. Besides… There's something
I want to do as well, while they're away. I think it will be
a good opportunity. Please… That jutsu you mentioned before,
I'd like to learn it. I can't be the only one on
the team who's lagging behind. I like that look on your face. Fine. But I'm warning you…
I won't go easy. Yes! Are you sure about this? I took you in because
Captain Fugaku asked me to. But everyone in the unit
is ranked way above you. The days will be long and hard
at the Feudal Lord's office. I'm looking forward to it. After my father and brother, you're the most skilled
among the Uchiha. As long as my brother is
on the Hokage's detail… I've always assumed that
you would be the next captain. And that's why you volunteered? I have a goal I must reach. And for that… All right, then it's fine by me. Let's go! Hey, I've been thinking
from before… Orochimaru is a bad guy, right? So why do you go out
of your way to look for him. Despite what he is now,
he was once my friend. But one day,
he went off the path. I should have set him right
back then. I couldn't stop him. I see… I can't help but to think… If I hadn't let him go,
he could still be here. I don't want you to have
the same kind of regrets. Uh-huh. Still, I haven't given up on him! I'll bring him back one day! Yeah! You didn't have to see me off… Now that won't do, y'know! Now listen carefully, Naruto. The Three Prohibitions of
the Shinobi must be strictly observed! Jiraiya Sensei tends to be too lax. Don't you dare imitate
his bad habits! I'm sorry… She insisted on seeing you off. That goes without saying, y'know! What if Naruto picks up
bad habits while accompanying Sensei
on his intel gathering?! PITTER-PATTER

I worry enough about his antics
and recklessness. Don't worry. If he gets in my way, I'll just transport him away to
Mount Myoboku or someplace. Mount Myoboku? No matter what kind
of food you're served, just hang in there. U-Uh-huh. Hey… Be careful on your journey. You guys! Just don't go overboard. If you try too hard, you'll make us look
like we're slacking off. What're you saying?! We're going to work hard too! I refuse to be a genin forever! I'll have you know, I'm on track to go straight
to the top. I already have a place
to train. Huh?! When did this happen?! I'm not going to lose to Naruto. Roger, y'know! Hey… It's about time to leave. Right! I'm ready! Okay! I'm off, y'know! I can't believe that a shinobi
of your caliber failed… If that plan succeeded, we could have gotten rid of
the faction of moderate jonin who support the Fourth Hokage
in one swoop, and spread our political influence. You can't blame it all on me. The plan failed due to the shinobi
that Hizashi assembled. Since you installed Hizashi
as the point-person for this plan, some of the blame lies with you. I did what I was supposed to do. So I expect the contract
to be honored. I understand. What are your wishes
for the next vessel? Well… Actually, Itachi would
have been ideal. But it was too late this time… The next time around,
he'll be past his prime. I see… I'll choose a suitable candidate who possesses even
better qualities than Itachi, one who will reach his physical peak
in three years' time. Yes, I'm counting on you. Someone young, beautiful,
and strong. An ideal body… Not yet! Ouch! Chidori Stream! All right. That's pretty good. So you're going back to
the Hidden Leaf Village as soon as
your replacement arrives? Yeah… I've learned everything I can here. Besides, I have a goal
I have to fulfill. It's none of my business, but… It's good to have a goal. But getting too attached to a goal can lead someone off
the right path. I want you to remember that. Your interference is unnecessary. Thanks for the last three years. I want to make sure
with my own eyes… But I guess it's out of
the question since I'm stuck here. You're back. I heard the report. Only the elite were sent there… But I understand that
you've developed into a shinobi who's second only to Shisui. It's no big deal. I'll surpass Itachi, soon. Listen to you,
such confidence now… This is… A lieutenant's armband for
the Leaf Police Force. Talk is easy. Now demonstrate your skills
in a real mission. Looking forward to it! I've returned, to dispel the humiliation
of that day. And this time… I'll take you down and prove to you
who's stronger! The recent activities of
the Leaf Police Force are unpardonable!

 It must be a form of protest.

 They're annoyed because their
circumstances remained unchanged.

 They're starting to lose patience.

 Especially the younger generation.

 And the one at the center
of all of this is…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 Sasuke, huh? One of the most gifted
members of the Uchiha Clan.

 Impossible… He took us all out
in one swoop! It was a blessing that this gang of thieves
escaped into our territory. Our superior is none other
than the lieutenant, the most skilled in
the organization, our pride and joy. There's no way
you could've gotten away. Brilliant as usual. So? What do we do with them…? What we always do. Understood. Hey, guys! Teach them a lesson and
make an example out of them! Do they have to
beat them up so much? Lately, their methods
have been extreme! They say it's to maintain
public morals… But they're just throwing
their weight around. Did you say something? Oh, scary! We'd better watch what we say,
or we're gonna get it too! Sasuke… LEAF POLICE FORCE

 ON STANDBY

I thought it would be
too extreme at first… But seeing the results,
it all ended up being a good idea. If we hurt them enough, bad guys won't resort
to crime again. The same goes with the villagers. This acts as a preventative so we're killing two birds
with one stone. No…We get to let off steam too, so it's like killing three birds
with one stone! Honestly, until Mr. Sasuke came,
everyone was getting fed up. Our main issue was at a standstill while our work kept
increasing steadily. All Captain Fugaku says is
to heed the Hokage and wait. If things were going
to change by waiting, they would've changed long ago. Absolutely… We have to apply pressure too. Lord Fugaku's ways
are too weak. We're going to
follow you, Lieutenant. Talk is easy. Now demonstrate your skills
in a real mission. This isn't difficult at all… The recent activities of the Leaf Police Force
are unpardonable! There's no doubt that
crime has gone down, but the villagers are
growing uneasy by the day. It must be a form of protest. They must be annoyed because their circumstances
remain unchanged… They're starting to
lose patience. Change takes time. My father understands this. However, others feel
frustrated by this. Especially the younger generation. And the one at
the center of all this is… the clan's most gifted member,
Sasuke. Sasuke, you're back. Perhaps they're being rough, but they've haven't deviated
from their duties. I believe my father would still
like to keep observing them. And if we make the wrong move,
we'll only invite more resistance. What a drag… Everyone's so uptight in
the village because of them… It's so annoying. Until recently, this used to be
such a lively place filled with food stands! Since they're so strict about
regulating everything… it's so deserted now. I know. I want to know
what Sasuke's thinking… But he's so unapproachable
these days. Do you think it will ever
go back to how it was? This is strange… Weren't there lots of
food stands here before? That voice! Is it…Naruto?! Sakura! You guys! When did you get back? Just now. Pervy Sage had to make a stop,
so I just came home first. You kinda look a little
more distinguished! Really? You guys haven't changed at all! What're you saying?
We've changed a lot. Look! That's—! While you were gone,
we all became chunin. Not only that, Neji,
who was a class ahead of us, is now a jonin. Which means… I'm the only one from
our class who's still a genin?! Actually…Sasuke is one too. Since he was at the Feudal Lord's
office all this time. What's going on with Sasuke? Yeah, well… Since you've been away, things have gotten
a little complicated. Hey you! Who gave you permission
to open up shop?! I'm sorry, but until now… Never mind. Come with me. Damn it! She's just a grandma!
That's overkill! You're—! Oh no, it's that kid… He's come back, huh? Breaking the rules
the minute you return? Seems like you haven't
grown up at all, have you? Well, you sure have changed. Choji, take granny. Right. – Hey!
– Sorry… but I can't let you pass. What do we do, Lieutenant? We're not going to back down from any obstructions
of our duties. Still talking about
that kinda stuff? I've been waiting for this day… What is this feeling? Stop it, both of you! Are you aware that
this is a public road? You're—! We're just two friends
having a friendly fight, It's none of your business
so back off, old man! You idiot! Huh?! What, Sakura?! Hey! Let's just get out of here! Are they going to run away?! Forget it. Leave them alone. But—! That's an order. Just continue your rounds. Naruto Uzumaki… He's gained a lot of strength
in three years. His master Jiraiya has
taught him well. What is it that you want to say? I'm just posing a simple question. You should be much more
than how you are right now. How long will you remain
confined to where you're at? That's all. You don't just go around
calling someone like Lord Danzo "old man." I didn't know! Who the hell was that? He's one of the Leaf's top officials! In fact, he's the one
who's always at odds with Lord Fourth
and Lord Third. Even Lady Tsunade
strictly warned me to never get involved with him. You're so dense, Naruto. Thank you for earlier. Oh no… It's no big deal. It was the right thing to do… Well, I must get going. I hear he's always been on bad terms
with the Lieutenant. I just hope he doesn't make
this any worse than it already is. – Hey!
– It's okay. There's no end
to it if you get involved. More importantly,
getting back to Sasuke… Pervy Sage told me… If a friend wanders off the path,
you have to pull them back onto it. So next time,
we have to stop Sasuke. Yeah! Are you sure about
leaving them alone, Lieutenant? I know he's gonna give
you more trouble! Shut up! Lieutenant! I have work to do. If you're a member of
the Leaf Police Force, use your own judgment instead
of always depending on me. Naruto Uzumaki… He's gained a lot of strength
in three years. I don't know how he trained… But he's nothing like how
he was in the past. I'm not strong enough. How do I—?! That child Sasuke… …possesses fine eyes. Oh yeah, the Police Force
had a run-in with the Hokage's son yesterday. What?! I just saw them. They were walking around
like nothing happened. So the Police Force acts
all big with us commoners, but their hands are tied when it comes
to the son of a powerful official, huh? They're just the Hokage's lapdogs,
after all. Everyone's started gossiping. Letting him go was a big mistake! We've been clamping down
on everyone until now. So when we make an exception
and go easy on someone… they drag us through the mud. But the Lieutenant said
to leave him alone! He also entrusted us
to handle things on our own! Thinking about the sake
of our clan, we have to make the right decisions. I'm gonna go all out and
whip up something special today! What—?! What's going on?! You can't just barge
into someone's house… especially with your dirty shoes on! Bring us Naruto Uzumaki! We want to question him about
interfering with our duties the other day. I know nothing about it. Interfering with your duty? My son would never
do such a thing! Besides, on whose authority
are you acting? I'm going to tell Minato and you're going
to get an earful, y'know! If you try to protect him,
we'll take you with us too! What's the big idea… barging in like this? Excuse me. What is it? The captain wants to see you. Please come with me now, Lieutenant. I had some misgivings, but I never expected
the members of the Police Force would raid the Hokage's residence
without the proper authorization. My sincerest apologies. Well, at least no one was hurt. So, what does Fugaku
think about all of this? He knows that he has
to take action now. I'm sure he'll take appropriate
measures of discipline. I just hope they ease up a little now. You guys! We're sorry, Lieutenant! We only did this for
the sake of the Uchiha. Enough. Lock them up. Sir! You said you'd take
a different path. And you did become stronger. But after all that boasting, I had hoped there was
some substance to it. But I guess it was for nothing. What you ended up doing
was empowering fools to indulge in idiotic behavior. Nothing good came out of this. You will never measure up
to your brother Itachi! I don't need someone
like you in my unit. You are hereby relieved
of your duties as lieutenant. I am dismissing you
from the Leaf Police Force. The Leaf Police Force did that? So what's going to happen
to Sasuke? I don't know. But I wouldn't be surprised
if he's fired from the force. We'll just slap him on the back and welcome him back
into our team again. Okay! What the hell… …was I doing for
the last three years? Why is he so different from me?! It's power… I need power. You've come. You called me, so you must have
something up your sleeve. I just came to see
what you're offering. You came just to see? I want to take advantage of you too. I figured we'd have
a nice little chat. And? What do you want? I want power… Enough to beat him. I predicted as much. But…are you sure? Not only is Naruto Uzumaki
the Hokage's son… he's also the Jinchuriki
of the Nine Tails, which is essential to this village. If you realize your goal,
it's possible that the Uchiha's standing
in the village will worsen. I don't care. Beating him means
everything to me… I don't care about
the Uchiha or the Hidden Leaf. What's so funny? I remember a shinobi who
deserted the village long ago saying something
along those lines… He betrayed everyone, committed numerous crimes
and in exchange… obtained frightening power. His name is Orochimaru… One of the Legendary Sannin,
like Jiraiya, Naruto's mentor. The Legendary Sannin. He has knowledge of
the myriad jutsu that exist in this world
including forbidden ones. I can't think of a better person
to learn from than him. However…he is a man
who has lived within the darkness. Remember that's the price you'll pay. I'm looking forward to it. Fine then. Before sunrise,
go to the tower at the border. I'll take care of the rest. We're not done yet. I want to know what
you get out of this. It's your choice to believe me
or to not… But I am one among many
who do not look too kindly on that monster, the Nine Tails. It's a monster that could
rampage at any moment, I question if it's wise to leave
such a power unbridled… I feel we need the power
to fight against it. Go. We have a contract now. The rest is up to you. Shiro! Take care of yourself. If you're gonna have
a midnight snack, it's got to be rich and heavy! Sasuke? Where's he going at this hour? Here you go.
Five orders of fried chicken bites! I gave you some extra too! Oh! Awesome! All right, our shift's over. Time to close the gate. We didn't get any advance notices
about departures at this hour… Hey, we're closing the gate! Wait! I'm grateful to you.

 But this isn't enough.

 I'm not satisfied with the lackluster
level that I'm at right now.

 I'm going to get power…

 at the side of that
other Sannin.

 Those three years…

 I can't let those three years
end in a blink of an eye!

 All right, our shift's over.
Time to close the gate. We didn't get any advance notices
about departures at this hour… Hey, we're closing the gate! Wait! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
Leaving the Village Where are you going
at this hour? And why would you need
to resort to all this? I'm grateful to you… but this isn't enough. I'm not satisfied with the lackluster level
that I'm at right now. I'm going to get power… at the side of that
other Sannin. Don't tell me you're—?! Damn it! It's too late. Sasuke! The Uchiha's genjutsu
is powerful. You won't be able to do
anything for a while. Are you all right, Kakashi? Yes, never mind me. Sasuke's… I heard earlier from
Izumo and Kotetsu. Where is Sasuke heading that he'd resort to
hurting you as well? Most likely, to Orochimaru. To gain more power. What? Orochimaru…? That's so foolish! Orochimaru will soon be looking
for his next vessel. That's what Jiraiya said. Sasuke is in danger! No way! We can't let Sasuke make contact
with Orochimaru. And… I want to prevent any rumors
that he left the village from spreading. I'm going to issue
an urgent lockdown order. That's a good idea. In order to prevent Uchiha's position
from worsening, we must handle this internally and bring Sasuke back
quickly and smoothly. NINJA ACADEMY
 What's going on? We're on lockdown,
but you called us to assemble… I'll explain once everyone is here. Heh! What's with the attitude? Oh, by the way, why are we meeting
in the classroom? U-Uh, I couldn't think
of anywhere else. HOKAGE
 Were the desks and chairs
always this small? No, we just got bigger. Guess you're right. Sakura's eyes are
popping out of her head… What's so great about
that guy anyways? I don't get it! Damn it, Naruto!
Don't glare at Sasuke! Move. Just beat him up, Sasuke! That's right! Huh? No way?!
Oops! Sorry! A headband… A current Academy student wouldn't
have one of those yet. Sorry we're late! We're late because you insisted
on walking here on your hands. Are we the last ones? Yeah, we're all here now. All here? What about that damn Sasuke? It's because of Sasuke that things
have become a bit of a drag. Right, Sakura? Uh…yeah! I was outside of
Lady Tsunade's office and overheard Kakashi Sensei
and Lord Hokage talking… Sasuke…left the village. W-What?! Sasuke did what?! W-Why? He went to find Orochimaru. I don't know why, but he left
in order to get power. Say… Isn't Orochimaru one
of the Legendary Sannin?! Yeah… Furthermore, the rumor is
that he killed several villagers for his experiments and ran away
when he was discovered. Why would he go to
someone like that? That man is still dangerous, so what kind of power
is Sasuke seeking? Naruto… This headband… Sasuke…was here. The headband, which symbolizes
the Hidden Leaf… He left it here in
the Academy classroom, which holds so many memories
for all of us. So in other words,
does it mean that Sasuke… has abandoned us,
and the Hidden Leaf? No way! Okay, so he's been a little irritable lately
and short with me, and he said some sarcastic things
that made me mad… But he's a Hidden Leaf… he's our friend! Naruto… Orochimaru is going to
steal Sasuke's body to use as his vessel… Sasuke doesn't know that. What the hell is Sasuke doing?! I'm gonna bring Sasuke back… before he meets up with Orochimaru! I'm bringing him back
to the village! Hold on a minute. We have to think of the position
the Uchiha are in too… We can't make
a big deal out of this… Still, we can't let Naruto go alone. So Naruto and I'll go. Naruto! I know, Sakura. I'll bring him back even if I have
to beat the hell outta him! See? This is our secret tunnel. Akamaru and I occasionally
go outside of the village for fancy moonlight picnics. Why are you calling it a picnic?
You just take him for walks! Yeah! You're gonna get
caught one day! I wouldn't mess up like that. Besides, thanks to him,
we can go outside now, so you should be thankful. Shikamaru, we'd better hurry. Yeah… Naruto! Sakura? Naruto, please… Please bring Sasuke back, no matter what! Don't worry! I'll bring Sasuke back. I promise you that! We're counting on you,
Naruto and Shikamaru. Yeah, you bet! Naruto… Please be careful. Sasuke boldly walked
out the front gate leaving clear tracks everywhere. That makes it easier to follow him. Sasuke… Why? Why did you—? I'm… Why did I think you would
be like Itachi? Perhaps it's still too soon for you. Itachi was able to perfectly master it
when he was about your age. Damn it… Chidori Stream! Those three years… What is this feeling? I can't let those three years end
in a blink of an eye! Naruto Uzumaki… He's gained a lot of strength
in three years. That loser! I'm going to obtain power,
no matter what it takes… Minato! Kushina! Listen to this… Despite the lockdown order, Naruto's snuck out and
gone off somewhere and hasn't come back. Well uh… You're not supposed
to leave the house either. It's not only Naruto, ya know. Shikamaru's missing too. What? Sakura and Ino were at home,
but something didn't seem right. It's like they were hiding something. Hiding? Yeah. Like what if they saw examples of
Naruto becoming a delinquent, like him going out every night,
doing something dangerous…? And because Sakura and Ino
are just too nice, they didn't tell us because
they don't want us to worry… Are you even listening, Minato?! Oh, yes. Don't worry about Naruto. I think he's probably out
doing some training. This way! Right! If Sasuke of the Uchiha Clan
leaves the village, there will be a few who
will not stand idly by… Mainly the children reared
by this cowardly system that has been passed on by
the Third Hokage through to the Fourth. Keep watch on them, and if they make a move,
follow them. I want the gift to Orochimaru
to reach him safely. If they interfere, get rid of them. Use whatever means necessary. It's possible those fools won't be
the only ones on the move. Therefore, I have gathered you,
the best of the Foundation. Do your best. Not good! Damn it! No…! What?! Bushy Brows?! Neji! Tenten! What are you doing here? We saw some shadowy figures
pursuing you as soon as you left the village. And we hurried over to
be your back up. I must say, being of help
like this is much more invigorating than
just staying in the village! Don't get too enthusiastic! Nothing good happens
when you get too excited! No, get as enthusiastic
as you want. You're a big help! Incoming! You guys are—! Those masks… ! They're ANBU? Don't tell me Dad already
found out?! Only the four here…
followed us. And there are five of us.
This will be easy! Sorry, but… We can't retreat even if
Dad tells us to! You idiots! You can't just get into
a fight with the ANBU! We definitely have
to bring Sasuke back before he meets up
with Orochimaru, ya know! So please! Don't get in our way! Get back, everyone! They're not ordinary ANBU… Naruto! Are you okay? They're coming at us
with intent to kill. This is way too harsh… considering that all we did was
disobey the lockdown order. On top of that, there's no way they would try to
kill Naruto, the Hokage's son. I get it now… These ANBU aren't the ones
under the Hokage. They're with the militant faction
led by someone else. Not the pacifist faction headed up
by the Third and Fourth Hokage. It was supposed to have been
dismantled already. I heard about it a while ago… That a separate ANBU unit
still exists which serves as
a training division. I remember it was called…
the Foundation. The Foundation? So they belong to the Foundation… Damn it! At this rate, 
we'll never catch up to Sasuke! These guys aren't
under the Hokage! They're from the underground
organization, the Foundation. I don't care if they're underground
or aboveground! If you're trying to kill me, come at me and fair and square
with your faces showing! Just try and get me! Such a hot-blooded child… Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Pursuers" We're from the same village,
but these guys… What's going on? JIRAIYA NINJA SCROLLS:

 Damn it, we lost them. Where are they hiding? Post Superflat is
my style of art, hmm! There he goes again,
making a big spectacle. We knew things would
end up like this. This is what happens when
you leave things to Deidara! But that's not good, is it? Hey, did you witness my art? I got rid of those little gnats
from the Sand in one swoop, hmm! Y-Yeah… What the hell are you doing?! If you mess up our precious targets
like that, they'll be useless! Like I care! My art culminates in an explosion! Quit messing around, damn it! I found one we might
be able to use. See! Instead of complaining,
start working like a real partner! You're gonna get it! Let's go, Hidan! I know it's upsetting,
but our comrade calls. Let's depart. Damn it! Naruto… These guys aren't under the Hokage! They're from the underground
organization, the Foundation! I don't care if they're underground
or aboveground! If they're trying to kill me, they should come at me fair and
square with their faces showing! Just try and get me! Such a hot-blooded child... Shadow Clone Jutsu! We're from the same village,
but these guys... What's going on? Even if they're after
the Hokage's son… Why now? I get it… There's another reason
why they've come after us. Bluntly, they want to make sure
Sasuke reaches Orochimaru. Sasuke? To Orochimaru? I see… We're trying to bring Sasuke back,
so they're interfering with us! So that's how it is. You've got to be kidding!
Well, let 'em try and stop us! I'll kick their butts! Neji! Lee! Tenten! Run! What?! We're gonna run away?! We're going after Sasuke! We can't be engaging in
one-on-one battles. And that's exactly what they want… So Sasuke can get further
and further away. You're right. We wasted time. Neji! Can you pinpoint
Sasuke's position?! Byakugan! This way! We can still
catch up to him! Now then… We've got to do something
about that too… Here they come! Damn it… That just cost us
quite a bit of time! Bushy Brows! Let Lee handle this.
We have to keep after Sasuke! What're you saying?! We're all going to
bring Sasuke back! Sorry, Lee, but… I understand! I'll draw these guys in! All of you, go! Go after Sasuke! Let's go! We're going to save Sasuke… and I'm not letting
a single one of you pass! Shikamaru… You used Lee to hold them back. Yeah… Considering what takes precedence, we need to get as close to Sasuke
as possible. Looks that way… You're not getting away from me! After exchanging blows,
I realize that you are very strong. And I admire your strength. And so…this opportunity to
fight you fills me with happiness. I'm not as strong as you say, but I'll give it
everything I've got. GUTS
 I will also give it my all! The Fifth Gate of Closing… open! Here's what you requested. They seem quite damaged. Yeah… If you're not interested,
I'll take 'em with me. Of course, I'll take them. They'll decide whether
they're usable or not... If they complain, you tell 'em… These are the better ones. Let's go. Hey! Hey, c'mon! Damn it… They're all so… It doesn't seem like there's been much improvement to
the Akatsuki's military power. And here we are in a rush. The other corpses were too damaged
to be of any use. After all the trouble we went through to lure talented Hidden Sand
that had potential! That's true. The talented ones
should be handled with care. Exactly! But this idiot set off an explosion
and blew up all the bodies! Shut up! My explosion isn't just
an average explosion! It's art! Art, my foot! Fine! Go ahead and criticize me! Enough! What's done is done… Besides… It's not as though
we don't have other options. Why are you taking Deidara's side?! Remember the Hizashi incident? It can be said that the Akatsuki exists
thanks to Deidara. Are you thinking of joining up with
the genin from Hidden Leaf Village? Yeah… Although we're from different villages, I feel like we can
call them comrades. Perhaps the day will come
when we'll team up with them. Nagato, what's that? Doesn't it belong to those children? I found it on the road to the village. Since it was chaotic with everyone
trying to get home, they probably dropped it. They're probably making a fuss
about missing their stuffed toy. All right, I'll go return it to them. Yahiko? I'll be right back.
Wait here. Damn it! We get called up for some experiment,
so we come all the way here… and there's nothing to do? Give me a break! My art is too extravagant and won't be
of any use for this experiment?! That's bull! Anyone who sees my art will be
captivated by its brilliance! Fine! I'll give 'em a grand performance! Yahiko… Nagato… Nagato! Nagato, hang on! Why… Why did this happen? Who did this… Was it you?! Was this your doing? No… But we found this in the village. This is…! It's a special kunai the Hidden Leaf's
Hokage uses for his Flying Raijin Jutsu. This Hokage…of the Hidden…Leaf…? Are you saying the Hokage ordered this? Yeah, probably. For the Hidden Leaf, this was an embarrassing
and disgraceful incident... They probably wanted it to look like
this never happened. I'll never forgive him! From that day forward, Nagato and Konan stopped referring to
themselves as Team Jiraiya. In other words, that was the day that triggered their desire
for revenge against the Hidden Leaf. Yeah… The greatest motivator
for humans is revenge. By the way, what's gonna happen once the Akatsuki strengthens
its military power? Beats me…
You'd have to ask the guys on top. If there's anyone they want dead, I'll be
happy to blow them up with my art. Things will start happening in the
near future. Let's just wait and see. People of Hidden Leaf Village… You must feel the same pain
that I've experienced. Unless you know the same pain, you can never really understand
what others have felt. Pain upon the great nation! Hidden Leaf Style… Crescent Moon Dance! Sasuke… He's gonna get it when
I catch up to him. He's not gonna look
so cool when I'm done… I'll punch his eyes shut
and make him cry! That jerk! You heard him, Sasuke… Three left… I wish we could weaken
their strength all at once before they come at us... Tenten… I know… This time, I'll… Just draw one of them out. Don't overdo it. Go. We hurried out…
so these are the only scrolls I have... Oh no… This scroll is—! Moonlit Night! My survival supply scroll
came in handy! Soon… I'll have power very soon! Sasuke… Sasuke! Sasuke! So you're Orochimaru?

 What did you do to Sasuke?!

 You're still as annoying as ever...

 Sasuke, I'm here to take you back!

 Give me a break!
What can a loser like you do?

 I'll take you back by brute force
if necessary...

 There it is! That tower is Sasuke's goal. Where's Sasuke? He's already inside. Our strategy to weaken them one by one
is making them impatient. Those two plan on
settling this all at once. There are just two of them,
but there are three of us! It's no big deal! No, actually, there are
quite a few problems. Neji, I'm counting on you! I‘ve got it. The three of us can handle
the two of them! Don't worry, just run! It's useless… The entry to the suspension bridge
is already within the range of
my Eight Trigrams. Neither of you can enter this area. I wonder about that. A clone? Damn it! I guess I shouldn't get too greedy,
because one is my quota… I will not let you pass! Striking Shadow Snakes! Gentle Fist! 8 Trigram 2 Palms! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! 64 Palms! He's here! Damn it…from above? Hurry to the entrance! Naruto, are you all right?! Yeah, I'm okay. Sasuke is up there… Naruto! Go on ahead! I'll stop him. What are you talking about!
You're coming with…! No…don't tell me it's because
I'm the Hokage's son?! That's right…
You're the Hokage's son. In my own way,
I've watched you two all this time. The one who can sway Sasuke… The one who can bring
Sasuke back is you, Naruto. You're the only one
who can do it. Shikamaru… He's coming! Hurry, Naruto! Yeah! I'm counting on you, Shikamaru! Shadow Possession Jutsu…
complete. So you're a shadow user… Sorry, but… …you're going to keep me
company right here. I bear no grudge toward
any one of you. This is my mission. By the way, did you happen to catch
what the weather report was today? It's supposed to be cloudy
with some rain. Damn it,
this is not my kind of thing. You must be Sasuke. I've been waiting for you. You're Orochimaru… I understand there's something
you desire very much… It's power! Enough power to be able to
hold this world within my fist! Such a promising statement. I'm sorry… I took a shortcut and
I've been waiting for you. Just a little farther,
and I'll catch up to Sasuke! Why are you interfering?! You won't get to Sasuke. I won't let you go any further. Shut up! I won't let Sasuke become a vessel! This chakra is… You want it, don't you, kid? You want my power. Four tails…so suddenly? How can this be? Hokage Style Elder Jutsu:
Tenth Edict on Enlightenment! What? Is this even possible? The fifth tail?! Power… Hurry and give me power… How impatient… He stopped… Sasuke! You can't do that after
coming this far. You need my power, don't you? I don't need power. I just want to talk to Sasuke. So can you back off right now? Sasuke! What happened to you? That's amazing, Sasuke. Your body is already adapting
to the power. You must be Orochimaru! W-What did you do to Sasuke?! I fulfilled Sasuke's desire,
that's all. What did you say? You're still annoying as ever… Sasuke! I'm here to bring you back! Give me a break!
What can a loser like you do? I'll bring you back by force,
if necessary… Just try it. I'm not going to lose to you! I feel a surge of power… What is this power? This is different…even compared
to the other day! Don't you get it, Sasuke?! Orochimaru is… trying to make you his! It's power! As long as I have power,
that doesn't matter to me! Chidori Stream! Change in Chakra Form
comes so easily… This power… I'll show you the enormous
difference in my power! All right…I'll show you too! What power is…! Well, how about it? It should be fully infused by now. Get ready, Sasuke! What? What happened to him? Just plain taijutsu? Is that all? What? I thought I dodged it
with my Sharingan…! This boy… used Nature Energy… This is… It's Sage Mode! All this power… Naruto! Why do you…?! Why does it always have to be you?! Stop saying nonsense
and let's go home. I see… That power has a time limit. Well then… Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu! You disgust me, Naruto… Get lost! Disappear along with the thunder! You lost focus, didn't you? Your real target is over here. Sasuke… You'd really do this… …to me? What's so funny? Sasuke… I've always thought that
you and I were alike. What are you saying? I'm the Hokage's son. You're the son of
the Leaf's Police Force Chief, from the prestigious Uchiha Clan. We both grew up constantly
being compared to our dads… How hard it is to live under
someone's shadow… to always be watched by others… I thought you were the one person
who understood all that. Even though our situations
were the same, you were totally different… You kept progressing and
getting better… At first, I was frustrated. But then, I was proud of you. That's why I decided to do
my best and be like you. You've been my role model
all this time! Well, I'm different. You should've just stayed the same. Why couldn't you have
just stayed a loser? The weak and useless son
of the Hokage?! Sasuke… Even you…even you had
to become strong… You don't know how much
that made me…! Is that why… Is that why you sought power?! That's right, Naruto! The power to bring you down! You're the one… who's a loser. W-What is this
red chakra… He still has power like this?! Naruto… His power is levels above this. You have no choice
but to use my power. I'm gonna stop you even if I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs! Just what are you?! I'm your friend! That's why I'm saying I'm never gonna
let Orochimaru have you! Fine, I acknowledge you. I'll fight you as an equal from now. However, you won't be able to put
a single mark on my headband. Sasuke! Rasengan! Chidori! Big Brother! I came to bring you back, but it seems I'm a little late. No way! Naruto… Naruto, please get along
with my little brother. Forgive me, Sasuke. That was quite entertaining. W-What is that?

 As you can see, it's something that
defies the boundaries of reality…

 Neji, is everyone in the village safe?

 Can you confirm what that big thing
is with your Byakugan?

 I'm already doing that!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Another Moon"



 I don't know what kind of jutsu that is,
but I'll undo it!

 Tune in again!


 Naruto! He's regained consciousness! Thank goodness. What? Where am I? Is everyone okay? We're on our way back
to the village. For some reason,
the enemy retreated. Even though we were
at a disadvantage… Their goal was to deliver
Sasuke to Orochimaru. Yeah, but that's just a hunch. Huh? Where's Sasuke? What happened to Sasuke?! When I caught up,
I only found you unconscious. Sorry… I couldn't track them due to the rain. I see… But… I promised Sakura. Take it easy! No, I can't just lie around. Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
Another Moon



 I've sent Kotetsu and Izumo home. But just to be safe,
Kakashi will remain overnight. I see…That's a relief. Urgent news! Someone has infiltrated the village! You're—! It's been a while, Lady Tsunade. Do you know him? You're the boy Jiraiya saved
and took care of… from the Hidden Rain Village. You're Yahiko, right? So you remember me… I am called Pain now. Yahiko?! The one from the Hizashi incident
three years ago?! Why did you sneak in? Our pain is twofold… Firstly, from the Five Great Nations and the Five Great Villages… The pain of being trampled
by all of you… the physical pain of
the people you killed. Secondly, from the pain
in our hearts caused by the Hidden Leaf's betrayal. And now, our pain will become
the entire world's pain. What? True Planetary Devastation! What is that?! Shikamaru, explain it to me! As you can see… it's something that defies
the boundaries of reality. Hey Neji! Is everyone
in the village safe? Can you confirm what's inside
that big thing with your Byakugan? Yeah, I'm already on it. I'm starting to see chakra and it seems
to be coming from the villagers. So they're okay?! Yeah… But I'm not positive. Why that—! Naruto! What do you think you're doing,
in your condition?! I don't know what kind of
jutsu that is, but I'll undo it! Sakura, you're okay! I was out on a mission… What happened here? We don't know! Anyway, we have to find
the guy who did this and rescue everyone! That's crazy! You shouldn't move
in your condition! But everyone's inside that thing! We can't just sit back
and twiddle our thumbs! Sit over there! Just sit down! You need to recover first! All right, I'll use this time to— What?! What's happening?! It seems the power supply was cut off and the emergency back-up
system was activated. I can't teleport outside of the village? The wall…is closing in?! At this rate—! A simple Earth Style will do! Use a rock pillar as a support…
to stop it from closing in! The Akimichi Clan will use,
their Super Expansion Jutsu to push the wall back! I'll do whatever it takes
to hold it back! The priority of the Leaf Police
is to ensure the safety of all residents! Now go! We will protect
the Hidden Leaf Village! Stop the wall,
no matter what it takes! A physical attack has
absolutely no effect! Everyone reacted swiftly… Minato! This is a special Sealing Jutsu! If this continues, everyone will be crushed
by the mass of stone. Everyone is pushing it back, but it's only a matter of time… We have to do something
about the jutsu caster… Lord Fourth! I have an idea. Kushina, please stay here
with these two. Flying Raijin Jutsu! Lord Third! Is that you, Minato? This is a sealing attack
by the enemy. Unless this jutsu is countered
with a jutsu of equal strength, everyone will be crushed. As I thought… I was thinking about using
the Four Crimson Ray Formation. If you would help me,
Lord Hiruzen… All right. Lord Fourth, Tsunade possesses powers
equal to that of a Hokage. That makes three.
The Four Crimson Ray Formation… Kushina has
the Nine Tails' chakra. And she has more experience
with Sealing Jutsu than anyone here,
rivaling that of a Hokage… But the Four Crimson Ray Formation is no match for this powerful
Sealing Jutsu… Even a Tailed Beast would
have a difficult time suppressing it. But we don't have time! If we combine our strength with everyone who is pushing
back the wall, at least we can buy some time! Buy time, then what? Unless we do something
about the jutsu itself, this doesn't solve anything… We'll think of something definitive
during that time. Please get to each of
the four points of the village. All right! Shizune, go tend to the wounded! Understood! – Four Crimson Ray Formation!
– Four Crimson Ray Formation! All right, everyone, hang in there… If we can buy time, there's hope. Thanks to you Sakura,
I'm fully recovered! Why that—! Hey wait, Naruto! You've just recovered! He's hopeless. Summoning Jutsu! Are you the ones
who wrecked the village?! First off, I'm gonna beat up
each one of you, then we'll talk! That guy?! Naruto! That guy's Yahiko! From Team Jiraiya. You destroyed that village, and you still call yourselves
pupils of Pervy Sage—? We're the Akatsuki. I'm Tendo Pain. We cast off the name Jiraiya the moment the Hokage
of the Hidden Leaf burned that village and
everything inside of it to the ground… In order to hide the injustice
that occurred there. What are you talking about? You're the ones who
destroyed that village! We have proof. All that's left is to render judgment… for the pain caused to the weak! The pain of death, of my friends…
my precious friends… The people of the Hidden Leaf Village
and the Hokage will get to taste pain! I'll settle this! Naruto! Summoning Jutsu! Naruto! Why not? He's not an opponent
that we can deal with… However, Naruto… Amazing! Summoning Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! – Sage Art: Giant Rasengan!
– Sage Art: Giant Rasengan! No doubt…
The dimensions are different. But I can't just stand here
watching this! If there's an opportunity,
we should assist! I see… You know Sage Jutsu. You've mastered the same jutsu
as Jiraiya Sensei. You're no pupil of Pervy Sage! I'll pulverize you! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Sage Art: Rasen Shuriken! As I suspected… Sage Mode lasts no more
than five minutes. What?! Universal Pull! This guy… He's taking my Sage Art Chakra… Just perfect. What was that?
Was someone watching? Will this make you behave,
my sibling pupil? Naruto! I'm coming to help you! Almighty Push! Lee! I won't let you touch Naruto! That's right! Hinata was on a mission
outside the village! Why'd you come?! Hurry, get away! You'll only end up… I'm not afraid of dying,
to protect Naruto. Naruto is my— Almighty Push… I've experienced this
countless times. People who are dear to me dying, right before my very eyes, so close I could feel their breath… Share in my pain! It was just like this… My parents were killed
before my very eyes, by you Hidden Leaf Shinobi… The Nine Tails' power… It seems to respond
to Naruto's anger. Do you hate me? That's fine… However, my pain is even
greater than yours! Almighty Push! You overcame my Almighty Push… And in the recoil, I was—! Naruto… There's six tails! Universal Pull! The power of the Nine Tails
is magnificent. Planetary Devastation! What? Something inside me is…

 Kushina, what's wrong?

 The Nine Tails…

 I can usually keep it stabilized,

 but it's irritated and unsettled now.

 Is it because you're expending
so much chakra

 for the Four Crimson Rays?

 That's not it, ya know!

 I can feel it as well…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Comrade"


 There's something happening
to the Nine Tails!

 It barely missed a vital spot.
I think she'll be all right. Naruto… Damn it! How dare you… How dare you! This is unforgivable!
I'll—! Hey, monster fox!
Lend me some more of your power! I'll shatter this wall of rock
to pieces! This seal is in a different league. It will be difficult to break
even with my power. Besides, you're not able to
control my power properly yet. You're drowning in your anger. Shut up! Don't give up, everyone! However, it's probably impossible to
completely stop the compression. Ultimately… For now, I want to
put my trust in them. "Them?" What? Something inside of me is… Kushina, what's wrong? The Nine Tails… I can usually keep it stabilized but it's irritated and
unsettled now. Is it because you're expending
so much chakra for the Four Crimson Rays? That's not it, ya know! I can feel it as well… There's something happening
to the other Nine Tails. Naruto? Ino, contact those on the outside! I need to find out
what's going on over there! Right, Lord Fourth! Shikamaru! Can you hear me? Is that you, Ino?!
How are things on your side? It's not good, but we're managing. Anyways, let me know
what's going on out there! Okay. Over here, Naruto…
and uh, well…Yahiko… The enemy used a jutsu
to trap him in a moon-like seal, like what happened to the village. Naruto was?
Naruto's been sealed? Yes… Naruto went into Nine Tails State
and went on a rampage… So the enemy pulled rocks
from the ground, hardened them and
sealed him away. Sealed even in Nine Tails State? Kushina! He still doesn't have
enough strength or chakra… No way! You can't!
If you do that, Kushina, you'll—! Naruto is my son. I'm his mother. In order to save you,
and the people of the village… In order to do that… But…then… …I'll… All right. I know that once you make up
your mind, you don't listen to anyone. I'm sorry, Minato. But I'm the only one
who can save Naruto. Give me your power! Looking at you, I can't tell which
one of us is the one in a cage… How can you stay so calm?
If this continues, we'll all—! No, never mind.
I just want to defeat that guy! Mom?
How come you're—? Why are you so angry? "Why?" Well, that guy who blew up
that other village got you, Dad,
and everyone in our village! Oh yeah, and he even got Hinata… I can't forgive that guy… If you stay angry, you'll never
be able to use your power properly, no matter how strong you are. Calm down and check in on
how everyone is doing. You should be able to
sense them now. Huh? The people of the village,
everyone, is inside fighting. Hinata! Thank goodness! She's alive. Okay, so there's one less thing
to get angry about, right? When you're nice it's kind of
off-putting, ya know, Mom! When you're angry, you can't handle
the Nine Tails' power, ya know! Mom! The Nine Tails is—! Huh?
What's going on? Long ago… When the Nine Tails
attacked the village… Minato sealed half of
the Nine Tails inside of me, and the other half in you,
who had just been born. He believed that in time,
this power would be helpful to you. But everyone hated me so much…
all because of this monster fox… I'm sorry. Both Minato and I had faith
that in time, you would be able to control
this tremendous power. So what do I do? What must I do to use
this power properly?! Like I said, don't get mad. And pay close attention
to what people tell you. And then think about what
the right way is to use this power. You need a strong will
to wield strong power. "A strong will?" That's why… I use the Nine Tails Chakra
with a strong will. Mom… I'm going to pass on
my Nine Tails Chakra to you. Yin and Yang… When the two chakra become one, I'm sure we'll be able to
get out of here. What are you saying?
You're a Jinchuriki too. If the Nine Tails leaves
your body, you'll die. No! I'm going to make
my power and my will live… I don't understand
what you're saying! That's why I said to think.
Lord Jiraiya used to say… That you might be
the Child of Prophecy who will save
the future of shinobi. Child of Prophecy? Your will is going to
save the village… Mom… You are Minato's and
my precious son… I'm sorry… This is the only way. Half will do. Half is more than enough, right? That side seems pretty cozy, so I wouldn't mind
going over there… We might have to do this
again someday too… Nine Tails!
All right! Mom! I'm leaving the village
in your hands! Kushina!
Are you all right?! Naruto! Go! What? Almighty Push! You're not in here, right? I only have business with the real you.
I want to talk to you, face to face! I want to hear
your side of the story! You're around, aren't you?
Not here, but somewhere close by! There you are! Konan, get back. Nagato! It's all right. The one in the back
is the real Pain? So the strong has come
to punish the weak? You're the one manipulating
those other Pains? The last Pain you beat was Yahiko. Yahiko? He's no longer of this world. He died three years ago
in that village. You killed him. He's—? I see… But we're not the ones
who blew up your village! Back then, the Hidden Leaf, fearing a scandal, destroyed
that village to cover it up. That's how the Great Nations
save face. I supposed it's the obvious measure to avoid being ridiculed
by other villages. You're wrong! Until now, we thought
you guys were behind it. It doesn't matter anymore
about who thought what. It doesn't change the fact that my comrade Yahiko
was killed in that incident. Comrade? No doubt about it…
Losing a comrade is tough. Right now my friend is in danger of being turned into
Orochimaru's vessel. It's a dangerous situation. We've been rivals since we
were kids, and we trained together. He's an important comrade. Yahiko was an important
comrade to us too. Sasuke… Is going through a rough time, and he set out for
Orochimaru's on his own. I just have this feeling that he'd
understand if we exchanged fists… As his friend, I want him
to have one more chance… What are you saying? That's right… We're friends, so we should be
able to come to an understanding. That's why I'll never give up! I'll never give up! We keep being tossed around
by the Great Nations… But we'll rescue people like us
who are suffering and make them our friends… That's right! That's it! We'll make them all our friends. Then we'll be able to
come to an understanding without having to fight. We won't have to have wars! That's why we just have to make
Team Jiraiya bigger and bigger! Nagato? 'Cuz if I give up, there's no way
I can become the Hokage! I'll become the Hokage and become friends with shinobi
from lots of different places… No, not just with shinobi,
but with the kids too! Anyways… If we're friends, fights like this
don't have to happen! Is this…
A coincidence? We just have to become
friends with everyone… Then we'll be able to
come to an understanding without having to fight. You won't have to fight either! Anyways, I'm not asking you
to be my friend… But for starters,
let me join Team Jiraiya. I mean,
I was also Pervy Sage's student… I'm not asking you to be my friend…
I don't care if you stay with the Leaf. I want our aspirations
to be united…with yours. What are you? Nagato… I'm asking you to let me
join Team Pervy Sage. But before that I have to
save Sasuke and… save my comrades in the village. I will take on Pervy Sage's will. It's Team Jiraiya! You're very mysterious.
You two really are alike. You're right. Release… What did you just do? I released the jutsu. You're a mystery. The things you say… It's almost like someone
planned all this… No, In fact, maybe Sensei—! Anyway,
whether or not you're suitable to become a member
of Team Jiraiya… Depends on if you can
save that friend of yours… Yahiko was a man who held
his friends in high regard. If you're like him…then we can… …definitely be friends. I'll prove it. I'll save him! Your command of
the Leaf Police Force was exemplary. Thanks to you,
there were no casualties. I'm very grateful. Oh no… It was an emergency and I just did
what was expected of a Leaf Shinobi. That aside, your son has developed
into a fine young man. Whereas, I have failed as a parent. We're continuing to search
for the two of them. Regretfully, we haven't
gotten any hopeful leads. All this for Itachi and Sasuke… Your support and that of the village,
Lord Fourth, humble me. I'm just suffering the consequences
of my own actions. Perhaps,
I only paid attention to Itachi. I'm sure Sasuke suffered, being constantly compared
to his talented older brother. Mr. Fugaku… I keep seeing images
of them together, getting along. I wish I could see them once more
during my lifetime… Yes! This Chakra Nature! But, I've never seen this Change
in Chakra Form before. Who is it? Poison? You're—!
From back then! Itachi's your older brother, right? We are the Akatsuki. We've had our eyes on you
since you went to Orochimaru. That's why we saved you…
so a word of gratitude would be nice. Did you kill your brother? Why you—! You kept shouting deliriously… So it was easy to figure out. Get lost. Why did your brother have to die? The ones who should have died,
didn't die. Naruto! Are you going to forgive them? Forgive me, Sasuke. This irony… This contradiction…
Why don't you make it right? The Akatsuki will lend you a hand. Now tell me.
What is it that you want to do? I have one goal… To destroy the ones who are
controlling the Uchiha… To destroy the Hidden Leaf! Orochimaru's dead.
And it seems Sasuke Uchiha did it.

 What about Sasuke? Is he safe?

 Yeah, he is.

 But we've received intel
that he's targeting

 each and every Shinobi Village,

 alongside jonin level Rogue Ninja,
the Akatsuki.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 Tune in again!

 Excuse me! Enter. Everyone's here. Huh? Where's my dad? Representatives from each village have been in an emergency session
since morning. Lord Fourth took Kakashi and
the other jonin with him… They're participating as well. No wonder… Naruto! I'm here too. Pervy Sage! Lady Tsunade, what did you want
to see us about? It's regarding the news going around
in each region… News? The news that Orochimaru is dead. It seems Sasuke Uchiha did it. I'm just disappointed because
I wanted to bring Orochimaru back. Sorry about that, Pervy Sage… But I'm just glad that Sasuke
didn't end up as Orochimaru's vessel. There's one more thing… That the Akatsuki have been
attacking shinobi villages, kidnapping Kage and
jonin-class shinobi. And word is going around that Sasuke is
working alongside the Akatsuki. No way! I couldn't believe it either. But I gathered intel from
several trusted sources… and it seems to be true. Around now, they're probably
adopting a resolution to sanction the Akatsuki and Sasuke. Does that mean Sasuke will
become a wanted criminal? What did Dad say? Naturally, Lord Fourth would not
want that… And so… Here's all the data we've gathered. The members of Akatsuki,
their special abilities and where they have been spotted. Use this to find Sasuke before any
of the other villages, and bring him back. That's probably the only way
to save Sasuke. Got that? We'll be the tracking team to help
each team locate Sasuke! Do not take action on your own. We must work together. The reason is because our objective
is to find Sasuke and bring him back to the village.
That's it. Especially Naruto, don't go
rushing off on your own. I know that. All right, let's go! Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero-
The Shinobi Unite


 Hey! What is this? My art…my Human Puppets. They number in the several
tens of thousands. You've been making stuff like this
with the personnel we gathered? All this military build-up…
What are you going to use it for? We Akatsuki, will rule the world
instead of the Five Great Nations. First, we will crush
Hidden Leaf Village. So your strategy is to win with quantity? Your perception of what art is
differs from mine. Art has to be an explosion! Deidara, your aerial attack will disorient
and disorganize the enemy. I'll then send in
my Human Puppet army and there will be
an all-out ground battle. After my artful explosion,
there won't even be a blade of grass left. Are you stupid? Then there won't be anything left to rule! What? You got a problem with my art, damn it? You're done, you idiot! I'm letting you handle
the destruction of the Leaf, just as you wanted. Are you still unsatisfied? I just want to destroy
the current system that has the Fourth Hokage
at its helm. I have no intention of crushing
the Leaf Village itself. Are you planning on
deserting the Akatsuki? In the first place,
I never agreed to be your henchman. We took care of you when
you were almost dead… And you're gonna betray us now? A few of them have
broken the barrier and slipped into Akatsuki territory. The Five Great Nations probably sent them. So you caught
the scent too, eh, Akamaru? Found him! Sasuke is close by. Is it really Sasuke's scent? Which way? Follow me! The Akatsuki! Sasuke… Big Brother?! I thought you died… How can I leave, when your future, and the future of
the Uchiha Clan is in flux? Healing from my wounds
took longer than I expected. I'm glad you're okay. Sasuke, what are you trying to do? Where is it that you belong? That's… You should already know
what you must do… Where's Sasuke? Isn't Sasuke with you?! He was with us until a little while ago. But he didn't care for the way
we do things and took off. Talking with these guys
won't do anything. Let's just kill 'em off. You're the one from that village… Oh, I remember you! It's payback time. Let me have this one. Sure, do whatever you like. Naruto! Huh? You're all here. Yes, I tracked you with my Byakugan. That's Hidan, right? Leave him to us. But—! Don't worry! Thanks to Lady Tsunade's data,
I have his jutsu all figured out. Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Hey, I'm not falling for that trick! You're not getting away from us! - Yeah!
- Right! Hidan's gone. What do we do? You're his partner. Do something. Who are you calling his partner? Guess I have no choice… I think his name is Kakuzu. According to Lady Tsunade's intel,
he has five hearts. My Gentle Fist should
be able to handle that. Is there anything we can do? He specializes in mid-range attacks. Gentle Fist is a short-range attack. Got it. We'll create a diversion
and distract him. In that time, Neji…take him down! Here I go! You can try to run, but it's useless! It's finally time for my art to
make an appearance. What is that?! Didn't you read through the data? Uh, no. The C2 Dragon. Deidara is an explosives expert. If you're gonna compliment me, I wish you'd say
I'm an "explosive artist." Quit messing around! Huh? What is this? Watch out, Naruto! Whoa, there! That's a landmine! One step and my art will go off! Damn it! Sasuke? What? There was no explosion! He used Lightning Style to
deactivate the land mines! Why didn't you return to the village right after you brought
down Orochimaru?! I would have been happy to
take you on any time. We can talk after we finish these guys. They aren't your comrades?! Ones who don't share
my goal aren't my comrades. Then that makes it easy. Leave the ones up top, to us! Let's go, Akamaru! Fang Over Fang! Now, Akamaru! Dynamic Marking! Ew, that's disgusting! That jutsu didn't even have
one fragment of art to it! I can't stand it anymore… I'll show you what real art is! To hell with art! Hey, wait! You bastard! Why did you save me? Because I'll be the one
to take you down. We'll talk after
we take care of the Akatsuki. All right. This doesn't look good,
don't you think? Let's get out of here quietly before we get dragged into this. Now it's only you. Sasuke, I'm disappointed in you. Die! Cha! Chidori! Rasengan! It's been a long time since
I've been outside. What?! I'm gonna turn you into Human Puppet
comrades of the Akatsuki. We'll never become your comrades! Well, we'll see about that. Summoning Jutsu… Reanimation! W-What is this? Shinobi Puppet Users that Orochimaru
and I prepared while he was still alive. It's the same jutsu that was
used three years ago to resurrect Hizashi. On top of that… Well, how do like it? This is my art that will rule the Shinobi World
from now on… …the Human Puppet Army. S-So many of them… We have no choice
but to destroy them… Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu! It's Dad! And everyone! I rushed over from the summit
as soon as I heard. We can't ignore a friend, after all. Gaara! When it comes to puppets,
we're experts. We'll take you on. Aim for the Chakra Threads! Do that and these guys
become mere puppets! Naruto, you deal with Sasori. Right! Now, it's just you. He'll be your opponent. Impossible! Is that—?! It will all be over in an instant. Sakura…? I trained hard too, and caught up
to both of you. And besides… it's full now. Anyway…just watch! Cha! Wow…! Well then, how about this? They're! No way! Current Kage were turned
into Human Puppets too?! I had a hard time turning them
into Human Puppets. I lost a lot of military strength
because of that… To make up for the loss, Sasuke… I brought you into the Akatsuki. I should've turned you into
a Human Puppet right from the beginning! So that means… Sasuke's innocent? That doesn't matter. Right now, focus on the enemy
in front of us. Now! All right, they're sealed. - Summoning Jutsu!
- Summoning Jutsu! Lady Katsuyu, we'll work
on everyone's recovery! And we'll handle the Kage! Why are you going in alone?! I'll settle this by myself! Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! What?! He took out Aoda in one hit? See? Isn't that what you call art? Now you can become part of my art! Hold on a minute! Pervy Sage?! Team Jiraiya is on the scene! Nagato? Konan? It seems you were able to save
your comrade as you promised. Y-Yeah! Although we haven't quite made up yet. Then Naruto, you're… Yeah… Yahiko is dead,
but you're his replacement. That's… Team Jiraiya is back! The Child of Prophecy who will
save the future of shinobi… Let's see what you can do! Okay! Lava Style: Lava Monster Jutsu! How disappointing… You're too reckless, Sasuke. Big Brother? Why do you have to fight alone? You have comrades. Anyway, I'll help you out here now. Do what you want. Go! Gamakichi! This is bad! Leave it to me! Particle Style: Boundary Dismantling Jutsu! I'll absorb every jutsu. Now, Naruto! All right! Rasengan! Now, Sasuke! Impossible… My art is… Damn it! Not yet… It's not over yet! SASORI I will not lose… Nope, you can't win. What did you say? Just look around carefully. A guy who turns comrades
into puppets… can never win… against…my…friends! So idiotic. Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! Inferno Style: Flame Control! SASORI It's over… Sasuke, come back to the village. Can't we start over… and be friends? Yeah, I'll return to the Leaf Village. But don't get the wrong idea. Huh?! I have no intention of joining up
with you guys. I'm going to change the Shinobi World
in my own way. My feelings won't change, ever. 

 As a friend, I'm bringing you back! 

 I first met you at the Academy's
entrance ceremony, right? 

 So what about it? 

 It's been destined that
this would happen, since then! 

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Rival."

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,970
Hey, what do you mean by
"destroying the Leaf Village"? I mean today's Leaf Village! Today's Leaf Village...?! That means, Lady Tsunade will...! - You're right...
- What? Your story doesn't add up. I know Sai's boss used to oppose
Old Man Third Hokage, but why do they have to destroy
the Leaf Village... or do something
to Grandma Tsunade? Did you forget, Naruto? Lady Tsunade used to be
a favorite pupil of the Third. Besides that, the current regime of
the Leaf Village was initiated by
the Fifth Hokage, Lady Tsunade, and it obviously complies with
the wishes of the Third. Undoubtedly Danzo
is not happy about this... but most of the people in the village
support the current regime, so the regime
can't be changed easily. The only way
to change the regime is... to cause an earth-shaking event
in the village. An event like... the "The Destruction of the Hidden Leaf
Village" that Orochimaru set up. The destruction of
the Hidden Leaf Village...! Danzo may be thinking about
conspiring with Orochimaru and making him attack
Leaf Village one more time... in order to force Lady Tsunade
from the position of Hokage... So, you're saying they want
to destroy Leaf Village... - just because of that?!
- It's not only because of that! He wants to build his ideal village
after destroying the regime... and return to center stage as Hokage. The reason why Danzo went into
action at this late date is... ...because he sees it's been three years
since the last attack, so there has been enough time
for Orochimaru... to fully regain his forces. I think that's also part of it. Or he may have thought
Orochimaru is more cautious now because of the failure
of the last attack. If he acts now, he thinks
the negotiations with Orochimaru... will get under way easily. That means he's going to propose
cooperation from the village, right? Yes... Wait a minute...
You mean Sai's secret mission is... Perhaps... <i>The Consequences
<i>of Betrayal


</i> You mean,
Sai's top secret mission... ...is probably to earn Orochimaru's trust and serve as a liaison between
Danzo and Orochimaru. He thought the odds of him
running into Orochimaru... would be high
if he was in our group. That can't be...! If that's the case... then we might have to get rid of Sai. Get rid of him? Lord Orochimaru. I know. It appears we're being followed. Is he simply following us,
or is someone making him do that? What should we do? One way or the other... I'm afraid we're going
to need a corpse. Right, Kabuto? <i>Get rid of...</i> ...<i>Sai?</i> <i>No matter how you look at it,
<i>that's too hasty...</i> Now, my clone is
following them, but there's no way of knowing
what's gonna happen... We're gonna get on their trail
right away. - But...
- Okay! Let's go...! <i>What the...?</i> Naruto! Naruto! Are you all right? <i>He hasn't fully recovered yet from
<i>the damage he suffered earlier...</i> Captain Yamato... Sakura, we better get going... I know we should catch up
right now. But... But...with Naruto's condition
being like this... In that case, we'll leave him. <i>Leave him?
<i>How could he say such a thing...?!</i> He should have
enough strength left... to get back to the village
on his own. Kakashi Sensei would never
talk that way...! Sakura... Sakura...
I'll...be...all right... I can make it... Naruto! Sakura, I know
what you're trying to say. On top of that, I've teamed up with Kakashi
in the Anbu Black Ops Unit before... I also know the kind of person he is. It's true that I'm filling in
for Kakashi. But, I'm not Kakashi. I'm sorry, but I just can't say, "I won't let you get hurt,"
with a laugh. <i>I won't let my comrades die.</i> You're no longer apprentice Ninja
in need of protection, but Shinobi shouldering
the future of the Leaf Village... who will have to eventually
surpass Kakashi. Compassion and co-dependence
aren't the same thing! If we give up now,
it'll end in failure. If we don't follow now, we're never going
to catch Orochimaru. There is no second chance
with Orochimaru. Sakura... Yeah. It's time to get moving now. Naruto, what are you going to do? Of course... I'm going! Naruto! I'm okay... If I went back to
the village now... I wouldn't know
why I came this far. Naruto... Fine, but...
if you slow us down, we have to leave you behind,
do you understand? Okay! Then, let's go! <i>That's!</i> <i>You've sure done it...
<i>Orochimaru...</i> Naruto! Sakura! Sakura! Sakura... Are you all right, Sakura! That wound is... <i>Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
<i>must have entered...</i> <i>through the wound like poison...</i> <i>This can't easily be healed even
<i>with a skilled medical Ninjutsu.</i> <i>That's why...</i> <i>That's why I'm even more surprised</i> <i>that Naruto has been able
<i>to endure that Chakra.</i> This... This...was done by Orochimaru. Well, it hurts only a little, so...
I'm okay. Don't push yourself
too hard, Sakura. I got it... Let's take a little break. Sakura is our team's
only Medical Ninja... In other words, she is a key cog
in the success of our mission. I'm all right.
If we don't leave now... even you said... <i>I'm sorry...but I just can't say,</i> <i>"I won't let you get hurt."
<i>with a laugh.</i> <i>You're no longer apprentice Ninja
<i>in need of protection,</i> <i>but Shinobi shouldering
<i>the future of the Leaf Village...</i> <i>who will have to eventually
<i>surpass Kakashi.</i> <i>Compassion and co-dependence
<i>aren't the same thing!</i> It's true what I said, but they also say that
"haste is from the devil." I mean, there is a difference between
hurrying and recklessness. I agree! Captain Yamato is right! You are the only Medical Ninja
in our group with monstrous strength... So, you're the precious cog... I told you that you don't need
to add "monstrous strength"! - What, what?!
- Shut up! I'm just complimenting your... O-Okay, okay...
I apologize! Naruto! Since Sai's out, you'll be
my partner for the battle. Let's decide on our collaboration
patterns while we have time. Can you come over here
for a bit? Got it. They stopped the chase...
I wonder if it went well... Perhaps... At any rate... you did a fine job, as usual, Kabuto... I've created countless dead bodies
since I've been with you... It might have been
a little wasteful, though... Even so, it's better to be cautious. Oh. I got a good idea,
Lord Orochimaru. How about having him help out
our experiments? I think he'll have lots of free time... besides serving as
a liaison with Danzo... Hmm... do as you please. A fake body, just as I thought... Most likely this Jutsu
was done by Kabuto... <i>Sure enough, this wound
<i>is slow to heal...</i> <i>the best I can do is
<i>to ease the pain...</i> <i>This is far enough...</i> We're gonna do it here? Yes... But, first...! One moment, my Wood Clone
has just contacted me. Yes... That's right... There's an unnatural and subtle
stitching in the head... He's done a perfect job,
it's not noticeable at first glance. If we didn't prepare for this, we would have been fooled
completely... Amazing that they've already discovered
that we've been tailing them. I was confident, but... we have to be even more cautious
from now on... <i>Since we're dealing
<i>with Orochimaru...</i> <i>we can't be too careful.</i> Captain Yamato! Ah yes, I'm done with my errand. All right! So, what are
we gonna do first? But before that...
There's something I need to tell you. The one who hurt Sakura was... you, Naruto. Hey Sakura, is that the picture book
that belonged to Sai? Yes, it is. I'm wondering what's
in the book? Don't ask me. Hmm, it seems there're
no words or dialogue, though. Well, even if we see what's inside,
I bet It's not good at all. I'm hoping this book gives some
information leading to Sai... Come to think of it,
Sai cherishes this book, doesn't he? He also said it's
his older brother's book. Hey, don't you think
the facing pages are a little creepy? Next Time:
"The Unfinished Page" It's over… Sasuke, come back to the village. Can't we start over and be friends? Yeah,
I'll return to the Leaf Village. But don't get the wrong idea. Huh?! I have no intention of joining up
with you guys. I'm going to change
the Shinobi World in my own way. Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero -
Rival


 My feelings won't change. Just what are you? I'm your friend! So that's why I'm saying I'm never gonna let
Orochimaru have you! I'm taking you back as a friend. I'm going to take you down. That's all I've ever thought about. C'mon, Naruto! I'm not gonna lose! Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Fireball Jutsu! Ever since the Nine-Tails incident, we Uchiha have lived
under suspicion. We're forced to live on
the outskirts of the village… and looked upon with distrust. If things continue like this... Negotiations with
the village are ongoing. If we are diligent
in fulfilling our duties, we are sure to get
a positive response. I promise you that. There are volatile youths among us. Ones who cannot stand
the Fourth Hokage and would rather… Watch your tongue! The Hokage… I first met you at the Academy
entrance ceremony. So what about it? It's been destined that
this would happen, since then! You're Sasuke of the Uchiha Clan? Will you be friends
with my son, Naruto? Oh, Lord Hokage… Hello. Let's see… Rather than a friend… my Sasuke will grow up to be
a fine rival for your son. This is…the Hokage's kid? At the Academy, as the son
of the head of the Uchiha... I remember Itachi
when he entered… You are definitely his brother. I was constantly compared
to my big brother. Even when I thought
the pressure would crush me… I was determined never
to lose to you, the Hokage's son. In the end,
I was ranked at the top. While you were the loser… But, rather than feeling superior,
I was annoyed. How could someone like you
be the Hokage's son? You could never be my rival. How would I know? You're talking about stuff
from a long time ago! However… That day… My dog! Someone!
Someone, please save him! It's too dangerous! Don't go! But—! If you try to save it, you'll be swept away
by the currents too. There…there…You're safe now. I was so mad at myself. I stood by the river and
couldn't move. But you didn't even think
about living or dying. You just jumped in and
saved the puppy. My body just moved. – It wasn't a big deal.
– Don't say that! I wasn't able to act. But you did,
without any hesitation. That made me so mad. Then a while after that… The dissatisfaction among
the Uchiha reached its peak, almost to the verge of revolt. There's no need to dirty
your hands any more. With the joining of
the Uchiha and Senju, which was never thought possible… peace has been preserved within
the Village Hidden in the Leaves. And it will last beyond this night… long into the future. The Fourth Hokage brilliantly averted an Uchiha coup d'état
through negotiation. My opinion towards both the Hokage
and you changed completely. Sasuke! You aren't just a loser. You possess something
I don't have. I felt we could become real rivals. But you...didn't change one bit! You stayed a loser,
always laughing foolishly... And I ended up acknowledging you! But you—! That's not my fault! I've tried hard to do
something about it. I wanted to grow strong with you. Fighting…honing our skills together… That's what I wanted. But all of a sudden, you—! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto?! Here I come! Rasengan! Naruto! You left me behind
all alone and got better. That's why I desperately
tried to keep up. Chidori Stream! I obtained power from Orochimaru… and surpassed even him… And yet, you keep progressing and
advancing further away from me. I don't care about catching up
to you anymore. I'm going to take
you down right now! You'll never get ahead
of me ever again! I'll show you who's on top
right here and right now! How's that? It's not enough! I've still got my clones, ya know! That's—! It's Sage Mode! Sage Art: Giant Rasengan! I'm not done yet! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Sage Art: Rasen Shuriken! Not yet… It's still not enough! I was able to aim for
my best… because of you! I was able to get this far
because I thought of you…as my rival! You make me sick! Don't underestimate the Uchiha... No, me! I'm gonna surpass you! He's serious. He's dead set on destroying you. Can you lend me some power? Sasuke's power is awesome. I got it. Use my power. Demon Fox! Uh, I mean... What's your name? SEAL

My real name is...Kurama. Kurama…Thank you! This is bad! Those black flames are—! Naruto, use your Tailed Beast Bomb! Huh? What's that? It's the same as the Rasengan. I'm going to bring this destiny
between us to an end. Naruto… I'm going to take you down! Just try, Sasuke! As your friend, I'll stop you! Naruto! Sasuke! You have always been, and will always be… my friend. You're my friend, ya know that? That hurt…you idiot. A punch from a friend should hurt! You could always jump
into action radiantly, in any situation. Seeing you do that was
so blinding. Sasuke… I was so jealous of you. That's all it was… Then that's what friends are. And so, the Child of Prophecy,
Naruto Uzumaki, would become the Hokage, and with his friends,
forge through thick and thin towards a bright future
for the shinobi. Thus ends the "Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls:
The Tale of Naruto the Hero, Part One." So Naruto becomes the Hokage… Talk about playing favorites... But those two, eh…? Right? It's not a bad ending, is it? Well… I guess you could say that. Tsunade… Tsunade! You're so loud! I read it all, didn't I? J-Jiraiya! Tsunade... Dan? What were you reading? Hey, where's Jiraiya's book? I don't know. I finished reading his novel and… You're still half-asleep, aren't you? Dan? There's still some time before we leave
for the Five Kage Summit… Why don't you sleep
a little bit longer? I'm tired of dreaming. "EROHARA"

Nawaki, you want something awesome? Keep this a secret from
your older sister. Hey! Ji-raiya… What's going on
outside right now?

 Sasuke?

 What difference
will it make, knowing that?

 Hey, Sasuke!
We need to work as a team!

 Team 7 needs to work together
to bring down Madara!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

 "Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness:
Birth and Death"


 We might be the only ones left.


 Tune in again!


 At last! The world of the Infinite Tsukuyomi
is now here! Naruto! You can't right now! Don't go outside! Without my Susano'o's protection, you'd be bound up in
his genjutsu as well! Itachi's Story –
Light and Darkness:
Birth and Death


 FIRE

What in the world is going on?! WIND
 EARTH
 LIGHTNING
 WATER
 Just what is this? Are they inside? Blocking the light with the Susano'o? What's going on outside right now? Sasuke? What difference will it make,
knowing that? There is nothing
you can do right now. Sasuke… That's not the point. Naruto and I also want to know. In order to analyze our next move, Sakura is… Kakashi… You're being just like Sakura now. Just be quiet for a bit. Hey, Sasuke! We need to work as a team! Team 7 needs to work together
to bring Madara down! You're right.
There's nothing I can do right now… Kakashi Sensei! If you can analyze what's outside
with your left eye, Sasuke… you should be the one to lead
Team 7's four-man squad. Huh?! I doubt he's better at planning
than either you or Sakura! Although he may be
better than me… Anyway… Madara has activated his jutsu. It's a powerful genjutsu. I suspect everyone outside
has fallen under its spell. We might be the only ones left unaffected. The Infinite Tsukuyomi, huh? So right about now, everyone's… Inside a dream. Lord Kiba! I think I'll start by establishing
a new holiday called Dog Day! It's the Hokage's Decree! Everyone will own a dog! Go get a dog! It's the Hokage's Decree! I've finally found a new species! There, there… Wow! What a feast! This looks so tasy! I went all out and cooked
all this just for you, dear! Looks like you've found a fan! Thanks for the food! I just love gluttons!
I think they're so manly! I'm sorry… I ate your share too. It's okay… There's so much more! I am so happy! How many times
do I have to tell you?! If you're going to be late
coming back from a mission, let me know! I made dinner for nothing, - Marriage is such a drag.
- and you kept me waiting. I think I'll pass. - Haven't you learned after all these years?
- Yeah. I won't let you have Ino. Ino is my woman… Get lost! No, she is my woman. Stop fighting, both of you! My daughter's so popular. This is such a pain! Great Leaf Hurricane! Youth prevails! Oh, Lee! I love you! S-Sakura! - Sai!
- Sai! Oh, Sai. Hey, Sai. Good morning, everyone. 'Morning. You have a really nice smile,
as usual. Do you think so? You really do have
a beautiful smile, Sai. It is super cool! Oh… Sai! Your smile's the best
in the Hidden Leaf! I've finally perfected it! It flies! It moves!
My ultimate puppet! He embodies all the dreams
of the Sand! You will be the guardian deity
of the Sand! Let's go! Elder Sister, Elder Sister! Please help me.
I need to pick your brain! Calm down. What is it? You see… Hold on! Let me discuss something
with you first! You're the Kazekage now.
Make your own decisions. No! I really want to hear your opinion! Me too! Please, Elder Sister! It just has to be you!
Elder Sister! Elder Sister! Elder Sister! My little brothers are so hopeless. And then Gaara—! Is that so? At the Academy? Uh-huh! Lord Gaara. Your friend is here to see you. Hey! What are we gonna play today? Let's go outside! Gaara… Don't stay out too late. Uh-huh. So when can we get outta here? It seems the genjutsu
runs on moonlight. Which will gradually wane. But as long as there's light,
it's useless. Damn it! I need to tell you everything
before we part. There's no need to lie anymore. I'll show you the entire truth. These are Itachi's memories! Back then, Itachi told me
about the discord between the Hidden Leaf
and the Uchiha… but that wasn't all. These aren't just memories… It's Itachi's knowledge,
his thoughts, his suffering… I will love you always… It's everything that Itachi Uchiha
the shinobi was… Madara…
Don't talk about the Uchiha. The only one who has that right
is my Big Brother. So this is…the Great Ninja War.  Water! Water! Th-Thank you… Ninja Tools? Father… Why did this shinobi
try to kill me? I didn't do anything… Because this is war. "War"? It's not a war between people. It's a war between nations. That's why strangers
kill each other meaninglessly. Is that what it is? That is what the shinobi world is. Listen, Itachi… Never forget this sight… Uh-huh. We managed an armistice,
but the sacrifice was just too great. Lord Third intends to take
full responsibility and retire. There are voices in support of
installing you, Captain, as the Fourth Hokage. - Please…
- Enough talk. What should we do
about Kakashi Hatake? He doesn't belong to our clan,
but he possesses the Sharingan. I understand Obito Uchiha
fought bravely. Let's respect his wishes. We should bring the Sharingan
back to the Uchiha… The war just ended. Do not sow seeds of discord. Yes, sir. We finally have peace. We will persevere to maintain it. That is the duty of the Uchiha… Grieving over the dead
is meaningless. If there's any meaning in death,
it's to take advantage of it. What is the meaning of life? There is none. There's meaning in life if it's eternal. There's no meaning… in life? No one wants to die, right? You guys… What is life, anyway? Please take care. Thank you very much! Mom… What is it? Are you sick? Oh, it's nothing like that. You see… You're going to have
a little brother or sister. Yes. You're going to
be a big brother. Mom, I want a little brother. But a sister will be cute too,
wouldn't it? I have a feeling
it's going to be a little brother. Oh! It's snowing! It will be born in the summer. It's a boy!
He's your little brother. A life… A new life. Have you decided on a name? Yes. Sasuke… Sasuke Uchiha. Oh… It's a fine name, but that's… Yes, it's Lord Third's father's name.
I've already asked Lord Third. I see. Sasuke… We shall raise him to never
dishonor his name. There, there, Itachi! Itachi! Itachi! I'm like that too. Birth…death…birth…death… Hey, hey! Aren't you Itachi?
An Uchiha in my class? Let's play together. What do you want to do today? Kick the can!
Let's play kick the can! Huh?
We played that yesterday! Hey! Are you dissing us? Say something! I have shuriken training right now. - Wow...
- Wow... Well then… Let's practice shuriken too! No, don't! That kid! Trying to act cool! What a stuck-up! Hey, you guys. Stop it! Shut up!
This is between us guys! Life is born. Life dies. Life is…a battle… Hey! Don't run away! Wow! Was it a girl? It's a boy. He's so cute! What's your name? Hey Mom… Is Lord Fourth going to
have a baby too? Yes, I wonder what it'll be. I'll be going out tonight,
so go ahead and have dinner. Okay. Your father's working too,
so please watch Sasuke. Uh-huh. It's a full moon tonight, Sasuke. What is this? Welcome home, father!
Please teach me jutsu!

 Jutsu?
 
 Aren't they teaching you
at the Academy?

 It's too easy.

 As expected from my son.
I guess it would be for you.

 Wait for me at
the training grounds.

 Make sure you're home
by dinner.

You got a little scared, huh? This is an announcement
from the Leaf Police! All civilians are to evacuate
to the southeast shelter! The southeast shelter! Dad! Mom! Come here! Itachi! Hurry! Okay! We're going to the shelter. This way! Hurry! Mom! Keep going. Itachi? Everyone will be there. Please stay calm! You're safe here! Father! I knew you would be all right. Get to the shelter quickly. Okay. We drove it out of the village. Don't let up. Keep attacking! Just about everyone has
been evacuated. Captain, we'll go after
the Nine Tails as well. The Leaf Police Force is to remain
and protect the civilians. But Captain! These are the Village's orders. What was that just now?! Looks like they sealed the Nine Tails… …somehow. Many lives were lost including the Fourth Hokage Minato
and his wife, Kushina… The facts behind the incident
are still unknown… Life is born… But for now, let us
mourn our comrades… And life…dies. Itachi! Thank you for before… Because of you, I was safe! I'm glad you didn't die. Your younger sister? Younger brother. Can I hold him? No. Why not? I don't want him to cry. You're not gonna cry, are you? There, there! There, there! There, there! Aww, come on! The Nine Tails' attack caused
devastation throughout the village. For the reconstruction, we've decided to revise a number
of the village's boundaries. We'd like the Aburame Clan
to move into this district. The clan previously submitted
a request to occupy the forest, so we took that into consideration. The Nara Clan's territory was
not part of the stricken area, so they will remain where they are. The Leaf Police Force headquarters
which sustained damage, will be rebuilt here. And the Uchiha Clan will move along
with the headquarters… Lord Danzo! The Uchiha Clan makes up
the Leaf Police Force that protects the Hidden Leaf. As such, that location is too far
from the village center. We wouldn't be able to act swiftly
in an emergency. We have the ANBU Black Ops
for such emergencies. The Leaf Police has to commute
to the training grounds, does it not? This location is near an area
that's ideal for training. You can use that area exclusively
for the Uchiha's training grounds. Continuing on… In conjunction with the reconstruction
of the Leaf Police Headquarters, the Uchiha Clan will also relocate. Home and buildings that
were spared will be… During the Nine Tails Incident, we Uchiha were not called upon
because they feared that we would use our Sharingan to
manipulate the Nine Tails. Even worse, there are some who say that the Uchiha
caused the Nine Tails Incident! They are sending us to the outskirts of
the village in order to keep an eye on us! This is just like during
the Second Hokage's era when the Uchiha were rounded up
and isolated in one part of the village! This time, it's even farther away! The village suspects us! Captain, we can't accept this decision! We should reject it outright! Captain! You are absolutely right. But the other clans have accepted
their respective relocations as well. The Uchiha cannot be
the lone voice of dissent. But Captain! I'll do what I can to negotiate
the conditions. But we must accept the move. Pass the word around. That is all. Dismissed. How do you feel? Let's go and see it, Father. The new training grounds. I like it here. Is that so? Father, teach me jutsu… Generational Uchiha Jutsu…
through the generations. All right! This is a fundamental Uchiha Ninjutsu… Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu. All right, the signs are… I did it! What a surprise. That's my boy. We'll be moving in no time, huh? Yeah. What's the matter? We're surrounded… I wish it was my imagination, but… What is it? It's nothing… "In no time," huh? The same could
be said about you, Itachi. Since you're going to be
six years old soon. CONGRATULATIONS ON
ENTERING THE ACADEMY Congratulations on your acceptance
into the Academy, everyone! From this day forth, do your best to reach your goals
to become a shinobi. I'm sure some of you have already
been taught ninjutsu in your households… But here at the Academy,
you will also train to coordinate and work together as
a team when you are in a group. The fundamentals are very important,
make sure you learn them well. All right, Kamano. What's the answer? I don't know! Then…Itachi? The seal is for the Water Style:
Water Bomb Jutsu. Correct. Keep that in mind everyone. It will be on the test. Itachi…Come at me. All right! Begin! The match is over! Okay, okay… Sorry, Sasuke.
Some other time, okay? Welcome home, Father! Please teach me jutsu! Jutsu? Aren't they teaching you
at the Academy? It's too easy. I guess it would be for you. Wait for me at the training grounds. Okay! Make sure you're home by dinner. Got it! Look over there! It's Itachi! Where? Oh, he's walking. He's so cool! Oh, he's looking this way! This is not good. Don't you think, gentlemen? For his sake, if he gets swept up by all of this
and gets the wrong idea… I agree. He's stuck up! It's me! He's looking at me! No, it's me! He started walking again! Itachi's walking! He's walking! It's decided then… - Yeah!
- Right! Ouch! Don't jump out at us like that, idiot! "Idiot"? Who are you calling "idiot"? You guys must be freshmen! You… …run into someone… and call 'em an "idiot"…? You ran into us! What did you say?! Hold it! Who the hell are you? A friend of theirs? All the freshmen this year are… …stuck up! - Wow!
- Wow! Take him to the infirmary. O-Okay. Itachi, you're really strong, my friend! "My friend"? Even upperclassmen are
easy targets for you, sir! "Sir"? Move it, move it! Master Itachi is coming through! "Master"? Make way! It's Master Itachi! - Move it! Make way!
- Stop it… - Outta the way!
- Please… Don't… There is birth… and death… Life… flocks together… SHINOBI
 What is a shinobi? What is a village? First in every class,
according to your progress report… That's my boy. Father… Hmm? Teach me jutsu. I want to know more
about being a shinobi. In cases like this, always make sure
you have an escape route. This is important.
If you're in a four-man team… You're very talented for your age. I'm no match for you, Shisui. Oh come on… What's wrong? Does the Academy bore you
so much that you're ditching? I'm not ditching. You guys! That's unfair! What's with that look? Hey! Cut it out! Hey you, stop! Itachi! Take this! What happened? He disappeared?! Yeah, he disappeared!
He disappeared! That's a clone… No… It's a Shadow Clone Jutsu! What's the matter? I have to get back. You do? Shisui… Why is there fighting in life? Who knows? But… If the fighting can be stopped,
I'd like to stop it. Me too! See you later. Aside from the clone jutsu which is a requirement for
graduating the Academy, Itachi Uchiha has already mastered
the Shadow Clone Jutsu, a forbidden jutsu. He excels in all other subjects. There's no purpose in keeping him
at the Academy any longer. Isn't he just a freshman? Yes. That doesn't matter.
This has happened before. That was a different era. This is not the age of war. The boy is a genius, no? I've never seen a student like him. So it will be better for Itachi
to let him graduate? Graduate? After only a year at the Academy? Yeah. The teacher said as long as
both parents agree. They want to talk to you at school. I see… That's my boy. GRADUATES' INFORMATION SESSION

 GRADUATES' INFORMATION SESSION

Graduates! You will now be assigned missions
from the village. We'll be forming
three-man teams led by one jonin… and you will be undertaking
your mission under their guidance. And now, I will announce the teams! Big Brother! What is this?

 This is…from back then!

 Life is born, and life dies…

 But life is saved again…

 Well…

 When I saved them back then,
I didn't really have any deep feelings.

 Itachi's Story -
Light and Darkness: The Pain of Living


 Father! We'll discuss this again later. Father! Returning from a mission, Itachi? Yeah! We haven't walked together
like this in a while. Well, I'm a genin now…
and have I missions. Oh, I see! That's right. Since the Uchiha moved here… GRADUATE'S INFORMATION SESSION …three years have passed. We were pushed to
the outskirts of the village, and the upper echelons
took away our authority… Many still voice strong dissatisfaction
towards their methods. You're aware of that too, right? We want to regain
our power one day… and step out from
the darkness into the light— Father, look! What's so funny? Sorry, Father… You're the face of the Uchiha. I'm proud to be able to
walk alongside you. Enough flattery… Should we get your favorite snack
on the way home? Yeah! DUMPLINGS SOLD OUT TODAY
DUMPLINGS It can't be helped
if they're all sold out… Itachi? Izumi… I'm sorry, Itachi. Are you sure I didn't interrupt
you and your dad? Yeah… It's okay. DUMPLINGS
 - It's been a while.
- Yeah. It's the first time since
you became a genin. That's right! I'm sorry I didn't get you
anything for your promotion… I didn't even congratulate you. I'm really sorry! You don't have to apologize
so much… This doesn't really qualify
as a gift. But if you don't mind,
won't you have one? My mom loves the tri-color
dumplings from that shop. But I guess someone like you
who's brilliant and who excels in ninjutsu and taijutsu
and whizzed through the Academy… wouldn't have a sweet tooth. Sorry for just assuming… Well, since I opened them… I guess I'll eat them all myself. Don't tell me… Do you want one? Is it strange? Oh no, it isn't that. I've known you for quite
some time, but I didn't know what
your favorite foods were. Rank and gender have
nothing to do with what someone likes to eat. Yeah, that's true. Sorry. I'm sorry… It's because, Itachi… You looked so ready
to use your Sharingan. It was funny. Okay, I won't laugh anymore.
Sorry, Itachi! Sorry, sorry! Let me make it up to you. Is there anything you want? "Anything I want"? Yeah! That's right. She's… Yeah… I thought so. But that's something
I can't give you. Hey! We have another mission… Stop flirting. We are not flirting! Itachi… I can't give them to you… But I'll pray for you… I hope that your Sharingan
awakens really soon. And when it does,
I'll congratulate you! How was the kunai
you bought the other day, Itachi? Yes, it was quite amazing. "Quite" amazing, eh? You're good with words. It's lightweight and
has a sharp edge. You couldn't get it
anywhere else for that price. Father also extends his thanks. I don't need your thanks… How about a discount on the price
of this next request, Captain? That and this job
are two separate things. I understand that, but… All right, so we have a mission. Do you understand the specifics? I don't get it, Minazuki Sensei! We just have to find a cat, right? So why do we have to wear this?! Tenma, as always,
you're so sassy. Huh?! What did you say?
You got a problem? Hey! Pipe down! You'll wake Tamaki! I'm not asking you to
find a mere lost cat. It's a search for a Ninja Cat. What's more, you'll be going
into the Den of Cats, where cats congregate. That explains this Ninja Tool. We need this Cat Tool which allows us
to understand cat language meow? Still... If it's only intel work, why… Huh?! Wow… That really looks great on you. You graduated at the top
of the class at the Academy! Have you no shame? Shame? Appearance has no place
in undertaking a mission, does it? Huh? Okay, no fighting. This is the picture of the Ninja Cat
that we're looking for. This cat is… Meow, meow, meow! Aww, don't say that,
you're super cute! Meow, meow. You're wearing that thing,
so cut it out with the cat-talk. It's even harder to understand,
especially with your heavy accent. What?! It's a mission,
so it can't be helped! That being said, this is
an embarrassment to my clan… You say that, – Hey Shinko! What's so funny?!
– but it looks so cute on you! All right! All right! First, let's gather intel. We'll split into two teams. Itachi and me,
and Tenma with Shinko. Scatter! BLACK TORTISE DISTRICT
RING DISTRICT
HOT SPRINGS
DEN CAVES

Let's get going too! BLACK TORTISE DISTRICT
RING DISTRICT
HOT SPRINGS

 HOT SPRINGS WHITE RESTAURANT

That was pretty quick. WHITE RESTAURANT

 WHITE RESTAURANT

Let's rendezvous with Tenma and Shinko. All right. I'll go get them. So what's the matter? It's nothing… No, there's something… This current mission… Rather, that Ninja Cat. It seems that cat is pretty special. Huh? Since when are you
a cat expert? I'm not! The leader of our clan… I mean, my dad's sick… The medicine for his treatment calls for some of
that Ninja Cat's whiskers. Then you should take some, right? It's okay, right? I dunno. Keep me in the dark. If you take it without my knowing,
it's okay. That's true. Just don't tell you-know-who! Huh? Talk about being a coward! Are you that jealous because Itachi,
who's way younger than you, skipped a bunch of grades
and graduated first in class? – If it wasn't for him…
– What? You'd be ranked at the top? I didn't say that! Yeah, yeah… Anyway, Itachi sure is awesome… There's no point in
competing with him. I'm not competing with him! And it has nothing to do
with being top-ranked! We've found out the location
of the Ninja Cat. Please regroup
with Minazuki Sensei. Ah, rejected again! CATNIP LIQUOR

And the clan just keeps harping on
about me getting married… So he was chasing
around some female cat and ended up here of all places… Seems like it. It seems as though our mission
is complete, but… Okay, I'll go. Everyone, hang back here. Hey! What do you want? I just overheard your story
and I sympathize, so I wanted to talk. Can you even understand
the feelings of a male cat who's been rejected meow? I do! I do understand
that feeling! I see… So you're not popular
with the ladies either. Uh… yeah, that's it. Well, have a drink meow. They just don't understand
a male's charm. That's why ladies just
don't have perspective… or rather a discerning eye… Don't insult her! Looks like there's a breakdown
in communications. Damn it! We should have done this
from the start! What's going on meow,
you brats? I'll take you on meow! You're not getting away! Damn it, he's going on ahead?! His paw…fluffy…fluffy… He's pretty good. We have to do something
about his mobility first… He's balancing himself with his tail. But that's not all… Those whiskers enhance
his spatial perception. In that case…! What are you aiming at meow? You're pretty good with the kunai, but you've still a ways to go, meow. Yeah, you're right. I thought I could have managed
five millimeters more… Huh?! Things went well here… But will it be in time? Don't underestimate
Speedy Tenma! This may end up causing
more than just a scratch… I'm glad we were
in time for both! I…did it! Thank you for your help. I did tell him to hurry up
and settle down… But I never expected him
to fall in love… This one has good skills,
but no eye for judging females. I just wanted to find the best bride
for the sake of our clan. The most important thing
is that you're okay. You fulfilled the mission just
as I requested… is what I'd like to say… But what happened
to his whiskers? To keep the fighting to a minimum,
there was no choice. So you cut them? Well, it's my fault for not giving you
a heads up on his skills… You didn't bring them back? No… they blew away in the wind. Well, I guess it can't be helped. Thank you for your efforts. Itachi… Next time you come,
I'll have you take care of the debts the Uchiha
have racked up. Good thing you got
what you needed, eh? Well, yeah… Cheer up, will ya? The fate of your clan rests on it, right? It's not that critical! But… If this cures my dad,
my clan will be secure. That Ninja Cat… And those grownups… They're all thinking about their clans… You'd better not be thinking
that you saved me. The thought hasn't crossed my mind. Even if you didn't end up
helping me… What are you doing?! Why are you still
saying stuff like that? He's your friend! Of course, he's going to help you! – Huh?! Me? His friend?!
– I was just fulfilling my mission. You stop being
so difficult as well! All right! Isn't there something
you want to say to Itachi?! I swear I'll make it up
to you for this! Why can't you just
say thank you?! Shinko, that hurt too much! Friend, huh? Big Brother! What is this? This is…from that time… Life is born, and life dies… But life is saved again… Wait… When I saved him back then, I didn't think too deeply about it. He's your friend! Of course,
he's going to help you! A clan grows… A village is born… And bonds are made… If that's what friends are… We were friends, no doubt about it. We formed a bond… That's why that happened… We had a bond… That's why he… I swear I'll make it up
to you for this! …died. I didn't understand back then… What real pain was. The pain of losing a life… I felt it for the first time
after losing it… No, I was made to realize it… The feeling of not wanting
to lose something precious. Big Brother! Your eyes! Will the day come when
you'll possess these eyes too?
 The day when you come
to know what sadness is? All right, I'll be going.

 Big Brother!
You promised we'd play today!

 That's right!

 But I have a mission.

 Forgive me, Sasuke… Next time.

 Sorry about that, Sasuke.

 I'm going to borrow your brother
for a little bit.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Shisui's Request"


 Sasuke was glaring at me too!


 Itachi's Story -
Light and Darkness:
Shisui's Request


 Tune in again!

 Are you leaving already? Yes. I see… You awakened your Sharingan
at age eight… I supposed the Village wants
to observe your abilities. This just shows how much power
and influence the Sharingan holds. I want you to be aware of that. It brings joy to the clan when
one of its own excels. Of course, I'm very proud of you too. He died… Father. But, do not rest on your laurels just because you have
the Sharingan now. In order to sharpen
the power in your eyes, you must continue to be diligent. Well, I don't need to lecture you. You are my son, after all. My friend died… But, Father is… Yes, Father. I will continue to be diligent. Good. I'll be on my way now. Big Brother! You said you'd play with me today! That's right, I did, didn't I? But I have a mission. Forgive me, Sasuke. Next time. Sorry about that, Sasuke. I'm gonna borrow your brother
for a little bit. Itachi's Story – Light and Darkness:
Shisui's Request


 Why did you lie? Sasuke resents me now. NO TRESPASSING

I know that was wrong of me… But Sasuke's a smart kid… I think he'll understand. "First, have one genin
accompany you, "and secure the scroll in question." Even if my training exercise
required a genin, it really didn't have to be you. Don't say that now! Even if it's not a real mission, none other than Shisui the jonin
requested me. I'm not lying when
I say it's a mission, right? Well, you're half right. Let's go. What are the details of
the training exercise? There are three parts. The first part is to find traces left
by a fugitive, and then to track him. Pretty good! Let's start from here. A footprint left on moss… As expected from Shisui… He doesn't miss the slightest details. This is… Our guy stepped on
a piece of a branch… Very perceptive of you! But, that's just a decoy. Dry wood like that would snap
when stepped on… but this piece still has
a lot of moisture. Also, see this clean cut? Obviously, he was in a hurry
to make a decoy… Sloppy work. Don't be disappointed… An animal could have left
that indentation in the moss, but only humans make decoys. And if he laid the decoy
over in that direction… A stone? Yes. The underside is dry
and the top is damp. Could this be a decoy too? Well…That's very possible. The moisture on the rock will tell us how long ago he was here. I see! Judging from the dryness,
only a short while has passed. This scent! Perfect! Let's go! I think a fish left that mark behind. So it's not a decoy? No. That's the main purpose
of leaving decoys. Everything starts to look
like them. Confusing their pursuers gives
the fugitive many additional options. At this rate, there's no way
I can find the fugitive by myself. I need to develop better
tracking skills. You're half right. Here. Drink up. It's because you're exceptional, Itachi… That's why… I bet you've never tried
to understand the feelings of someone who's not. Having the skills to track
a fugitive is important, but so is understanding
how he thinks. If you can understand his mindset, sometimes you can thwart
a fugitive even without those skills. I see! So… Let's move on to the second part
of the training exercise. The second part? Yeah… To encamp at night. The textbook said campfires
are prohibited. So does this mean there's another
reason behind doing this? Just eat. You're exceptional, Itachi. I'm still inexperienced. Earlier, if I had more skills… That's true. Don't laugh! Sorry, sorry…
It just makes me happy. "Happy"? Huh? No! Just listen… I thought that there was really nothing
I could teach you. But… You taught me a lot today. Yeah… And that's what
made me happy. So… Hmm? What about this campfire? Oh… It's nice to share a meal with
someone you feel at ease with. Enjoying a hot meal helps
cheer you up. Eat it while it's hot. Yeah… It's warm and tasty! Told you so! But… If I'm really exceptional… He wouldn't have died. I'm still so inexperienced. So why would someone like me… I… Hmm? Awakened the Sharingan… I see… Is that why…you lied? "Lied"? You said the same thing
at the start of practice. You're good at fooling yourself. That's why you can't grasp
your true feelings. You didn't want to stay
at home, right? That's the look you had
on your face. That might be true… Shisui picked up on how
I felt from the very beginning… I'll be happy to listen any time
you want to talk. The final part of the training
exercise is about to start. I'll assist you to the best
of my abilities! The pursuers are ANBU?! Is this an exercise? No… Put that out of your mind for now. Why are you attacking
a fellow Leaf shinobi? Would you consider forgetting that
you saw this and leaving? If you're going to kill a comrade, I can't look the other way
without hearing a reason! The truth is… We're going after those
who betrayed the village. Where's the proof that
he betrayed you? What a waste of time. Let's just kill them all. Just wait… It's not that he's a traitor. But he has evidence that proves
who the traitor is in that scroll. If he hands it over, we will disappear. So she says… You want the intel…
but for what purpose? Isn't it obvious?! Anyone who threatens the village
will be punished… We maintain the order in Leaf Village
with our code of darkness! You don't have the right to judge! I will hand this secret missive
to Lord Hokage… Lord Hokage will make
a fair and just judgment! "A fair and just judgment"? How naïve. You betray the village, you die.
That's that. Even a traitor has
a reason behind their actions! The Hokage's wish is
to investigate that carefully. That's one way of thinking. However… This involves the entire village. The gravity of one traitor versus
one village is far too great. What would Shisui…? He took the opportunity to
substitute himself out while we were "advising" him… Don't worry. My wire is coated with poison. His body will go numb and
he won't go far. Without words, they carry out
their purpose with blades… Leave it to the ANBU… Or rather, Lord Danzo's Foundation, right? Nameless individuals who maintain
peace from the shadows… I believe that is a true shinobi. Then you share our beliefs. No, you're wrong! Order maintained through
the power of the blade… …is not peace! I… Itachi…stay out of this! I am Itachi Uchiha! I will fight alongside Shisui! Itachi! So this is the how the ANBU fight. The Uchiha would dare to
push their luck and defy us? We will not show mercy,
even to children. At least make it fun for us! The one your friend is fighting, is a kunoichi who's unrivaled
within the Foundation. If you don't stop him quickly,
he will die. Retreat! Don't underestimate the Uchiha! Besides…he's exceptional! Sharingan! She keeps mixing it up
with double and triple layers. But…! I thought he was just a child,
but he has the Sharingan already? I can see it! So this is the power of the Sharingan! There's no right way or
wrong way to fight in a battle. But… I've already seen
through your attacks. I don't think so… You have already fallen into my trap. You're pretty good,
even though you're a child. What--? How?! I told you… I've seen through your attacks. That threaded ninja tool you threw… I changed its trajectory
just a little bit. You…damn Uchiha! Itachi seems to be doing fine. So I'll end things on my end! Teleportation Jutsu! Shadow Clones… No, they're just Afterimage Clones. If they're just afterimages,
I'll sense out the real one… What…? This is weird. I can't see the real one! Get the hell outta here! He didn't fly off! Namely…he has no mass.
But his attack is powerful… What's going on? My Teleportation Jutsu has no mass. But you could say everything has mass. It seems the jonin observing
our training exercise have noticed. We will be watching you
from the shadows… Shisui Uchiha… Itachi Uchiha! This is…! It's not a fatal wound.
Don't worry about it. Back then…if I had observed
the enemy more carefully… Never mind that… He wants us to forget
this incident ever happened. His life was threatened! So why? If this incident becomes known, it will sow the seeds
for a new conflict. This is not what Lord Hokage wants. The ones who aid peace from
the shadows are also…nameless. So there was fighting, but you assumed it was part
of the training exercise? I'm sorry. They were extremely strong, and I was doing my best
to protect the genin, so I didn't see their faces… No, we're at fault for not catching
their infiltration too. I'm glad neither of you are hurt. I'd like to talk to you more
about this tomorrow. But this training exercise is over. Itachi, let's go home. What's the matter? Ah… You sprained your ankle. You're making a big deal
out of nothing. When you first awaken
the Sharingan, sometimes there's a "slight gap" between the image your brain foresees
and your body's reaction time. And when you try too hard to
compensate for that slight gap… this happens. I said you're making
a big deal out of nothing. Oww! No matter how exceptional
you are, Itachi… don't overdo it. It's not funny! I'm sorry! I'm just happy. You're really like
a kid brother to me. So being able to take you under
my wing like this makes me happy. I want you to think of me
as your older brother and depend on me for anything. Shisui… Hmm? About the ANBU… Oh… Did I make the right decision? I won't say yes. I don't even know
if there is such a thing as justice in the Shinobi World. But that's…! We fight believing in our own justice. But if the enemy is doing
the same thing, who's right? You realized that during
today's exercise, didn't you? There's more than
one side to an issue. You must consider things
from various viewpoints. "Various…viewpoints"? You must be tired from
using your Sharingan. Go ahead and sleep. But there's one thing that's certain… I will never, ever betray you. That's the one thing
that's certain. So it's come to this. Shisui… I'm… I'm Itachi Uchiha.
I'll be part of ANBU from today. I'm looking forward
to working with you. I'm going to watch over the Hidden Leaf
from within the shadows. Starting from today,
you are an ANBU squad leader.

 You're not part of the Foundation,

 but your missions will
come from me.

 There's no need to tell
Hiruzen about this.

 Yes, sir.

 I know it's sudden but,
I have a mission for you.

 It's a simple assassination.

 When's the light gonna fade?! Just calm down, loser. How can I?! We don't know what's happening
to everyone outside! All we can do right now is wait. Until the Infinite Tsukuyomi subsides,
we can't go outside. Itachi's Story –

 That's my boy! You've become a member of
the ANBU and I'm very proud. However, keep this
close to your heart. Though you're an ANBU, you are first and foremost
Itachi of the Uchiha Clan. Yes. You're the only one I can count on,
my best friend. Protect the Village,
and the Uchiha name. If I die, many things will change… I've left a note. Shisui?! Don't stop me, Itachi… If you're truly my friend. Shisui! Shisui Uchiha, who threw himself
into the Nakano River and killed himself last night… I'M TIRED OF MISSIONS. IF THINGS
CONTINUE, THERE'S NO FUTURE LEFT
FOR THE UCHIHA...AND FOR ME.
I CAN NO LONGER GO AGAINST THIS PATH.

Why don't you come out and say it? Why don't you come out and say it? You suspect me, don't you? Yeah, we do, you punk. Listen, Itachi. Just try and betray the clan. And you'll pay big time. The clan, the clan... You overestimate your own abilities, and have no idea about
the depth of my own. That's why you're
groveling there now. Stop, Itachi! What is going on? Just wha— There's no hope left… for this pathetic clan. Brother! Please stop! Observe carefully with
those eyes... Sasuke. Observe how shallow this clan is. From today, you are now
an ANBU squad leader. It's not the Foundation, but mission orders
will come from me… There is no need to report this
to Hiruzen and his staff. Yes. Without further pause,
I have a mission for you. It's a simple assassination. The two behind you will assist you. We are your subordinates from today. We're honored to be of service. Good work… By the way... While you were away, the surveillance team that is
covering the Uchiha reported that the Leaf Police is strengthening
their armaments. What does this signify? Resentment towards the Village has
been increasing among the Uchiha. So we can't ignore it? No. FIRE LEAF

 Welcome home, Big Brother! I'm going to go train. Come with me. I'm exhausted from my mission. You never get tired, Big Brother. Ouch! Forgive me, Sasuke.
Maybe some other time. Man! You know about the clan meeting
in three days, right? No. Come alone to the Nakano Shrine
after the meeting. Without your ANBU subordinates. I'll be leaving tomorrow on
a mission away from the Village. Don't run away. "Run away"? From what? From your Uchiha destiny… Do you understand?
I'll be waiting. You two standby here. But, Captain! Just report that to Lord Danzo. Within the clan, only those
who possess the Sharingan can read the stone tablet… And even then,
they can read only part of it. But with your Mangekyo Sharingan,
you should be able to read further. So you want me to
tell you what it says? That's not necessary. Mangekyo?! You have them too, Father? It was during
the Third Great Ninja War… My friend gave his life to save me. Along with his tears of blood,
the Mangekyo was born. The Uchiha's way to salvation
is carved into this stone. But even with
the Mangekyo Sharingan, the end cannot be deciphered. It seems we still have a way to go. However, even if it's part way, once you read it,
you will understand, Itachi. The current situation forced upon
the Uchiha Clan right is wrong. Even so, to use force
to overcome it is… The higher-ups of the Village fear us. That is why they persecute us... out of fear towards our Sharingan. You're right. They fear we will
control the Nine Tails with the power of the Sharingan. That's just… …the legend of Madara Uchiha. Since then, no one has done
something like that. We don't even know if anyone can. But the higher-ups cling to
the ghosts of the past, and keep us at a distance out of fear. If they fear us… there is nothing else left to do,
but for us to control them. Will you use force
to become the Hokage? It's because the clan wishes it. I can't stop them. But I want to avoid
the use of brute force. That is why I kept
my Mangekyo Sharingan a secret. Why? I can control the Nine Tails
with Mangekyo Sharingan. If the clan learns of this,
they would desire even more. Watch! We've brought the Jinchuriki! Let's do it! The captain can do it! - Captain!
- Please! Use the power of the Uchiha! That's! Many in the clan resent the Village. When you're pushed into a corner,
you'll resort to things like this. There will be much bloodshed
on both sides. But Itachi... if you are with me… We can take them by surprise
and restrain the higher-ups. Some fighting will ensue, but with your help as
a member of ANBU, a bloodless revolution can happen! "A bloodless revolution"?! Itachi, you're my son. Please! Save our clan! Captain? Your orders. FIRE
 The Uchiha Clan… is intent on revolting against
the Hidden Leaf. There's no time to waste. We must strike preemptively
before them. The Uchiha were our comrades
in arms in past wars… I would like to use words
before violence. I will come up with a way. Despite what Lord Third said…
when push comes to shove… He will do what whatever it takes
to protect the Hidden Leaf. I want you to choose. Align with the Uchiha and
launch the coup d'état, and be slaughtered
along with your family… Or side with the Leaf, and before they attempt
a coup d'état, eliminate every Uchiha
except your younger brother? Eliminate the Uchiha… In order to protect the Leaf, every possible step must
be taken to avoid mayhem. The only one that can
handle this mission is you, a double agent for both
the Uchiha and the Leaf. There is no one else, Itachi. Will you accept this mission? The Village…the clan…shinobi… Is fighting…inevitable? The Village or the clan… What should I do? I wasn't serious just now. Yes , you were, loser. If I were serious,
I would have beaten you! This time, I challenge you
to the high jump! You're no match for me. What did you say?! Hey… There's something I would
like you to help me with. LEAF POLICE FORCE
 Who are you?! Itachi... What lies beyond this slaughter? Are you going to show me... a different future
from the one I showed you? This. LEAF POLICE FORCE
 Oh... Such fine eyes. No way! Help…Itachi. Help me! This is what I see for the future
of the village…and for the clan. I see… Sasuke, eh? A shadow Clone! Father is the worst possible
enemy for me. This is going to be a battle
of Mangekyo Sharingan… Over here… There are no traps.
Come inside. Father! I don't want to participate in
a death match…with my son. I see… You've aligned with the other side. Father, Mother… I… We already know, Itachi… Itachi, promise me this. Take care of Sasuke. I will. Do not fear it. This is the path you've chosen. Compared to yours,
our pain will end in an instant. Our philosophies may differ,
but I'm proud of you. You truly are a kind child. It's over. You're… Never mind. Shall we go? Go on ahead. I'm going to confirm things…
with the Leaf higher-ups. First, you have my thanks. Civil war has been averted
in the Hidden Leaf. We have maintained peace. Yes. However, I regret that there was
no other way to achieve this. I apologize. I'm the one who must apologize. You will now be branded
a Rogue Ninja who massacred his entire clan, and be listed in the Bingo Book
as a fugitive, wanted dead or alive. That goes without saying. What will you do from now? I've found aid from a group
called the "Akatsuki." I intend to stay close to them in order to make sure
a promise is not broken. What do you want now? You're a Rogue Ninja listed
in the Bingo Book, Captain. An S-class, no less. As Foundation members, we want to
make it appear like we pursued you. - Please go easy on us.
- Please go easy on us. Your swordsmanship hints at more
than just maintaining "appearances." The Sharingan won't work. We won't look into your eyes. A genjutsu?! How?! When you first came to me
as my subordinates… We are your subordinates from today. I imbedded a suggestion in case
you turned your sword on me. You didn't trust us…
from the very beginning? I was a double agent. I see through the eyes of
both the Leaf and the Uchiha. To be frank,
I don't know whose spy I was... even to this day. Within the organization, I'm known as Tobi. I'm not an official member. I'm a newbie within the Akatsuki who doesn't possess
any spectacular jutsu. You should…
treat me the same way. Why hide your true identity? If word gets out that
Madara Uchiha is still alive… things could become complicated. Only the leader of Akatsuki,
who we're meeting now, knows my true identity. Why, it's Itachi. It's been a long time. Mr. Orochimaru… That's right.
You're from the same region. Is this going to be
a touching reunion? I heard the rumors. I knew it…
so you were a shinobi like us… "Like us"? Those who consider bonds like
the village, the clan and comrades... to be a burden. The goal of the Akatsuki… is a world of true peace
among shinobi. Instead of the Five Great
Shinobi Nations, the Akatsuki shall rule the world. That's a big goal. That's why we're assembling
skilled shinobi without asking where they're from
or what they've done. Itachi of the Hidden Leaf,
we welcome you into the Akatsuki. From this moment on,
reject the Hidden Leaf. From now…
you are Itachi of the Akatsuki. SHU
 Show the world pain… Juzo... Huh? Form a two-man team with Itachi. Okay. Follow me, newbie. Yes. So Itachi, have you gotten
used to the Akatsuki?

 How would you feel about changing
partners and teaming up with me?

 I second changing partners!

 I'd like you to think about this
some more, leader.

 ITACHI'S STORY – LIGHT AND DARKNESS:
THE DARKNESS OF THE AKATSUKI.



 Tune in again!


 Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness:
The Darkness of the Akatsuki

 Do you know a shinobi
named Might Dai? I know a Might Guy. Huh, well that’s the kid from that time. I was one of the Seven Ninja
Swordsmen of the Mist. Thanks to Might Dai,
the seven of us got cut down to three. Who could have expected that
scuzzy bearded jerk would use taijutsu like that? Anyway, I wanna make
something clear... I could care less why
you joined the Akatsuki. I don’t even want
to hear your reason. It doesn’t matter why I joined either. And it’s okay if
you don’t want to know. Listen to me! There’s something
I need to ask you. And… It’s about your ninjutsu specialties. As you see, I use this Executioner’s Blade
and cut up enemies. So? How about you? Genjutsu, Fire Style and Shuriken Jutsu. You’re awfully humble! Former ANBU Itachi Uchiha, Itachi of
the Sharingan, the Clan-Killer Itachi... People throw around many nicknames
for you...you’re notorious. Let’s decide on our formations. You’ll start with a preemptive attack with your genjutsu, shuriken or
whatever’s your specialty. Then I’ll jump in. And you back me up. That will be Formation B What’s A? We each do things our own way. Understood. One word of warning. Don’t take any opponent for granted. Understood. - Who are you?
- Get out of our way! Shinobi villages only say things
about peace and order, but they’re really worried
about their roles shrinking. Behind the scenes,
they’re all trying to lessen their opponent’s power
while increasing their own. All the while, preventing other nations
from finding out their schemes. That’s why the Akatsuki gets jobs. The more peaceful the world is,
the more work we get... We accept every request.
We don’t care about the details. You scoundrels! Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Why you—! That’s why… We don’t know who’s inside
this palanquin… And we don’t want to know either. There’s also no need to think about who the hell would pay us
to do such dirty work. That’s what the Akatsuki is about. Pain, the leader, said the Akatsuki
was going to rule the world. That won’t be for a long time. We first need to amass money
and power. Speak of the devil,
he’s summoning us. So Itachi, have you gotten
used to the Akatsuki? How would you feel about changing
partners and teaming up with me? Hey, we’re just getting
our formation down. Don’t try to steal him. I second changing partners... There’s an aspect called compatibility... I wish our leader would put
a bit more thought into this. You’re one to talk, you damn snake! Thanks to your work, Akatsuki’s reputation
is growing in the underworld. The jobs we’re getting are
becoming bigger in scale, which means higher compensation
as well. But that’s only just a step. And the Akatsuki is ready to
move on to the next step… which are the Tailed Beasts. There’re supposed to be nine of ‘em.
Are those the Tailed Beasts? The Five Great Ninja Nations
harbor most of them. But the whereabouts are unknown
for a few of them. Those who aren’t on a job
will try to locate them. So we just have to locate them? For now. What will you do with them eventually? We’ll hunt down and collect
every Tailed Beast. And then? They’ll act as our deterrents in our quest
for world domination. Tailed Beasts? Seems to me there are
lots of other ways… There’s no mistake in
the leader’s reasoning. Here are the assignments. Juzo… You’ll handle the request
from the Land of Water. Isn’t there another mission I can do?! You’re familiar with the territory. This is ridiculous. I never wanted to go back
to that depressing place. Is that the village where you’re from? The job’s easy. We have to assassinate a member from the Feudal Lord's clan
in the Land of Water. I'll explain... It’s an intra-clan fight
over succession, a common occurrence in
the Land of Water. The Hidden Mist cannot interfere
in the Feudal Clan's affairs. That’s why they’ve come to the Akatsuki. This river’s the border. Have you ever been to
the Land of Water? Never on a mission. So for an outing then? You’ve got no sense of humor! But you do know, don’t you? What happens to a shinobi
from another village if he’s discovered in
the Land of Water? The Hidden Mist doesn’t have
a policy for prisoner exchange... If captured, the shinobi will be made
to divulge his jutsu and he’ll be disposed of. You have it good, Itachi. The Leaf is naïve. That’s why you and Orochimaru can go
around without a care as Rogue Ninja... There is a special unit in the Hidden Mist
that track down Rogue Ninja. If I ever get caught in this village… Oh, I forgot all about Formation C. If I’m caught by the Mist,
kill me immediately. If I have a chance. So what do you want me
to do for Formation D? Nothing in particular. Fine, let’s get going! Are you good at infiltrating? I'm average. Okay, show me. P-Please! Spare me! I don’t bear a grudge against you. This is just my job. W-Wait! Hey… Yeah. Hidden Mist Jutsu…! Wind Style! Supreme Typhoon! This is—?! Lord Fourth! Is that the Mizukage? Do you remember my warning? Any way you look at him,
he’s a kid. He’s the Jinchuriki of
the Three Tails. And they are the Mist’s
Shinobi Tracking Unit. I never expected you to reappear
in the Village, Juzo. I didn’t wanna come back either.
I had no choice. I have a ton of things to say to you… At the very least, I’m taking back
the Executioner’s Blade. Even if your partner
is Itachi of the Sharingan. So I guess a surprise attack with
your genjutsu is meaningless. What do you want to do? This one’s a Formation C. Formation C? Understood. Don’t look! It's a Water Clone! Itachi! Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu. Lord Fourth! You two… I’ll show no mercy. Tailed Beast State?! The Fourth is a Jinchuriki
who can control his Tailed Beast! This is not the Hidden Leaf! Juzo! It’s the Fourth’s Coral Palm Jutsu. Juzo?! Run… Itachi… W-What?! What is this? The power of the Mangekyo Sharingan? Why you—! Juzo…? Did you kill…the Mizukage? No, he’s not dead yet. Then… Hurry! Go! But… It's all over for me… You don’t have to be
a Medic Ninja to know that, right? I’m sorry. What a stupid thing to say. Do you have any last words
for anyone? Like I'd have anyone, idiot. I see…But you have someone
like that, huh? Hurry and go! I’m just gonna drop dead, right here,
where I'm from… …this god-forsaken,
Blood Mist Village… I thought my only partner… was this guy here, but… Juzo Biwa is dead. Oh my, and he was
your teammate, Itachi. The Jinchuriki of
the Three Tails killed him. Which means you took on
the Mizukage and came out of it alive. Another one of us is dead. Rather than being killed by the enemy,
he was killed by friendly fire. He was just too slow. Let everyone here be the judge of that. Fire Style: Searing Migraine! Done in bad faith. Sounds like it was on purpose. He should have just dodged it. You ignored your partner, didn't you? So what? You wanted to kill him, didn't you? So what? Oh, nothing. It just seems
to happen a lot. The Akatsuki works in two-man teams. What will you do, Kakuzu? Will you team up with Itachi
who’s also lost his partner? As long as he doesn’t irritate me. I wouldn’t know how to cater
to your moods. What the hell did you say?
Then let's team up and I'll show you. Wait, I’ll team up with Itachi. Are you trying to make a fool out of me?! The Akatsuki needs to
find some new members. We’ll put this issue on hold until we do. Do you know what eternal life is, Itachi? I don’t know yet, either. That’s why I need a new body. A magnificent body to link me
to eternal life. First of all, the problem with you…
is your greed. Impossible! Have I fallen prey to
the Paralysis Jutsu? What incredible Visual Prowess… Magnificent! Orochimaru… Try all of the jutsu you wish... But, my eyes can see through
all of them. You're so blunt… I’m not sure what to do with you. Whether to kill you right now,
or find a way to use you. I-Itachi! You just don’t have enough... No, you lack it completely...the greed… for human life! Lord Orochimaru! I’ll definitely get you back for this. Orochimaru betrayed and
deserted our organization. I knew it, that bastard. He always put himself
before the organization. I don’t intend to let Orochimaru
get away with this, but right now,
we’re short members. Hey! Hey! Hey! How about letting me join? Get lost! Okay… Leave Orochimaru to me. His subordinate, Kabuto, is my puppet. I’ll find out where
he’s hiding out in no time. No need to rush. I have someone in mind
to be your partner. It can wait until he joins us. What about me? Do I team up with Itachi? Work alone for a while longer. I have someone else I’ve prepared
to partner up with Itachi. I’m going to be your partner
from today. Hey, you over there!

 I’m not gonna fall for
your genjutsu ever again, hmm!

 I’m going to give you a little taste
of what art is.

 Let's leave it at that.

 Sasori…

 partner with Deidara and
go kill Orochimaru.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Partner"


 Who the hell is this Orochimaru guy?


 ITACHI'S STORY -
LIGHT AND DARKNESS: PARTNER


 Tune in again!


 Itachi's Story - 
Light and Darkness: Partner

 Over there? Yeah. The "Akatsuki"? Don't know and don't care. Now get lost! You're keeping me
from my "art appreciation" time. And I have to take this brat on
as my partner? Sure, he's full of energy, but he seems like
the type to die young. It's our leader's orders… His talent will be very useful. How do you know about my talent? Just who the hell are you anyway? We know you're aiding
anti-government factions of neighboring nations with bombings… You're a Rogue Ninja,
but what is your purpose? Purpose? I don't need a purpose! I take commissions to
cause explosions…using my art. He's annoying… Is he done? Who knows…? It doesn't matter. I'll do it. Let me make it clear,
I won't stop in my pursuit of art! Do as you please. But now that you're a part
of the Akatsuki, I expect you to fulfill your missions. BLUE
 All right, all right, I got it. But… you over there! I'll never get caught up
in your genjutsu again, hmm! Now that you're one of us, I doubt that I'll have to
use my genjutsu on you. I don't mind giving you
a taste of my art. Leave it at that. Sasori! Partner with Deidara
and go kill Orochimaru. About time. Who is this Orochimaru? I'll tell you on the way. Orochimaru has escaped
into the Land of Wind. Beyond that, I don't know. That's all I need to know. Let's go. You Akatsuki sure like
to order guys around… Hey, hurry up. I know! Itachi and Kisame,
go to the Hidden Grass Village. What about my partner? Wait just a while longer. I've ordered Kabuto to keep me
updated through several ways. If they're headed to
the Land of Wind, this is the spot… The Great Sand Dune of the East… I see… That's one place the guys
from the Village won't go near. Is that where you're from, my man? I don't want to talk about it. Anyway, that location
works out perfectly. That's his hideout. I'll blow the whole thing up
with my art, hmm! We don't even know if
he's there or not. Sand Snakes! It's useless… They know we're here. Are you serious? Let's go. I was expecting Itachi to
be the one who'd come… So you're the ones the Akatsuki sent? We're going to kill you
without hesitation, you traitor. Oh, do you really think you can? You're the boy from the Hidden Stone… You used to be in
the Demolitions Unit, right? Don't treat me like a kid! Keep watch from above and
make sure he doesn't get away. What gives, my man? Are you saying that you want
to capture him yourself? Yeah, since you have
no grudges against him, right? If you want back-up,
just call on me at any time, hmm! THREE

I have the geographical
advantage here. So that's your work, my man? You're aware of
the Third Kazekage's power, aren't you? Yes… My hobby is to collect things
that I find interesting, so I took a little bit. THREE
 What the hell? Huh? What's that over there? Is that you, Sasori…? You bastard, how dare
you do this to me! What's that, you damn snake? It‘s the Third Kazekage
that you killed. I used a Forbidden Jutsu
to resurrect him. Things won't go the way
they did last time… Enough of your resentful complaints… Now then… With your Human Puppet… and my Forbidden Jutsu. Let's see which is superior! Damn you… Iron Sand: Scattered Showers! Unlike the real thing, the puppet stops working when
Iron Sand gets into it, right? Don't lecture me about puppets! Unlike the real thing, I've built in lots of hidden tricks
into the puppet. It's your turn… Not yet. What?! This is one form of immortality… It doesn't die, even though
it's already dead. There's no way it can't die! Heargh! Well?! How do you like my art?! Why doesn't it die? After you two die, I'll resurrect you
both in the same way. Although, what I really wanted… was Itachi's body. My man! Does that guy have a weakness?! Resurrection isn't one of
the Third's abilities… You are both going to become
my pawns forever. Stop kidding around… I…am the Third Kazekage… I am not... your pawn! Oh my… I wonder if my jutsu wasn't complete? Take this! Is he dead?! Don't run away! Heargh! Art is…! …an explosion! Hey, c'mon now… We thoroughly searched
the mountain of rubble, but we didn't find his corpse. So we can't say for sure
that we killed him. If he's alive,
I swear I'll kill him myself. Besides, what was with
that ridiculous jutsu?! Do you know anything about it? It's probably the Second Hokage's
Reanimation Jutsu. You bring the dead back to life,
and control them like a puppet. You can't kill it even if you tried. So you must use a Sealing Jutsu or suppress their movement forcefully. We just have to kill Orochimaru, right? Even that won't stop a reanimated being… What's the supposed to mean? Be wary of Orochimaru from now on. If he's alive,
he's bound to make another move. Ordinarily, no one could
survive that explosion, hmm. No one who joins us is ordinary. Another immortal has appeared
out of the woodwork. We have a request from
the Land of Steam. A homicidal maniac
has appeared and they want us to eliminate him. Don't they have
their own Hidden Steam shinobi? Apparently, they can't kill it. So this homicidal maniac
is immortal too? Was he "reani-whatevered"
by Orochimaru too? I'm dispatching
a different team this time. You there… Would you like to join
the Way of Jashin? This wasn't for money or revenge. This was out of
a deep desire to kill. There are other ways
to quench blood thirst… He had some other purpose. You really have
a way of irritating me. And you… Did you come to
make sure I don't kill Itachi? There are no other
Sensory types besides me. And… The others certainly aren't
cut out to be decoys. Decoys? All right then… Hey, you over there. Do you want to join
the Way of Jashin? Way of Jashin? Yeah, the Way of Jashin… What is that? You can kill people and
you won't be punished. In fact, it just pleases
Lord Jashin even more. I see… What do you say?
Isn't that a wonderful teaching? Are you interested in joining? So you're the homicidal maniac… Homicidal maniac?
That's not it at all. I'm just offering up prayers
to Lord Jashin. Looks like I'll just have to
offer you up to Lord Jashin. Well? He doesn't seem to be
a Reanimation. Fine. I'll test him to see
how immortal he is. Who are you guys,
dressed up all the same? You in an orchestra or
band or something? Let's see… The gloomy one
over there plays bass… The girl does vocals and keyboards… No, maybe that guy there
does vocals? We're nothing like that. I think Lord Jashin would like
you guys as an offering. What's wrong?
Is running around all you can do?! Well, I won't let you get away! What? Done so soon? Ouch… That hurt! Oh… I'll punish you in the name of god! That's not gonna help you! Looks like the rumors about
your immortality are true. Okay, let's start the ritual. Everything is ready! Die…! One stab into the heart… Damn you! It feels so good… Glory be to Lord Jashin! You bastard…You got some nerve… Hey, hey… Why didn't you die? I'll beat you to death! No, you can't! Did you notice anything? He licked Kakuzu's blood and then mentioned something
about a ritual. That's probably some jutsu too. He passes on any damage he sustains
to the one whose blood he licks. However, that doesn't
explain his immortality. Can you separate them? Weren't you going to eliminate him? Yeah. W-What?! What's the big idea, Itachi?! Seems they're recruiting him. A guy like him? Are you kidding me? I refuse! Whatever the Akatsuki is… I have a mission to spread
the Way of Jashin. Then you should join the Akatsuki
for the sake of your mission too. What? Assassinations, war, you name it, the Akatsuki will do anything…
since we're a band of killers. I plan to continue propagating
the Way of Jashin. Do as you please. THREE
 Our two-man teams are in place. Go and execute your missions. I didn't expect to be
partnered with you. You took the words out of my mouth. Don't irritate me,
or I'll kill you. Like I said. Just try it! I don't want your heart. Art… …is an explosion! It's art! I still don't get what
your art is about. Soon, you'll understand the aesthetics
of something that's fleeting, hmm. Hm? It's the leader. A shinobi village named
the Hidden Sound recently came into existence. It's possible that
Orochimaru is involved. That guy! I want you two to
covertly check them out. Since you guys specialize in sneaking
around behind the scenes. I'll find him! And make him go boom! The orders were to do it covertly. There's been an incident
at the Hidden Leaf Village. Orochimaru's behind it. Orochimaru used shinobi from
the Hidden Sound and Hidden Sand to wage war against the Leaf… But he failed to completely
destroy the Leaf. Serves him right! The Third Hokage
was killed in battle. Orochimaru withdrew,
but his whereabouts are unknown. I'll send someone out
to investigate, but… I'll go. Then I'll leave this to you, as well as the status
of the Leaf's Jinchuriki. It seems they
averted total destruction, but they've sustained
massive damage. That Village was at
the height of prosperity… How tragic. That was out of character. So even you have feelings
for your birthplace, after all? No… Not at all. Sasuke… Are you safe? It's been a while Sasuke.

 Itachi Uchiha…I'm going to kill you! 

 Ah, the Sharingan.

 Nevertheless, he's a lot like you.
Who is he?

 He's my younger brother.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Truth"


 Has your Sharingan awakened?

 Itachi's Story –
Light and Darkness: Truth


 DUMPLINGS
 Kakashi. It's unusual that
you're here first. Well, it happens once in a while. What's going on?
Why did you summon us here? Sasuke! You've grown up… It's been a long time, Sasuke. Itachi Uchiha! I will… …kill you! Ah…the Sharingan. I see a resemblance…
Just who is he? He's my younger brother. So you've awakened your Sharingan. Otherwise… It's just as you've said. I've hated you, and resented you. I have lived my life… How strong have you gotten? …for the sole purpose
of killing you… Chidori?! I see…it was Kakashi, huh? Sasuke! Damn it! Ninja Art: Summoning—! Too slow! Master Jiraiya! So your target is Naruto,
after all? Taking Naruto is the overriding
mission we have been assigned to, by the Akatsuki. I can't let you have Naruto. I wonder about that… Perfect timing. I will get rid of
both of you right here. Don't interfere… If anyone is going to kill him…
It will be me. I have no interest
in you right now. Not yet, Sasuke. Sasuke! Damn it! Naruto! I said not to interfere! This is my fight! That's right. Fine by me! You still don't have enough… Forgive me, Sasuke. Forgive me! You are merciless. Hate me… You are weak. From now, for 24 hours…
Relive that day. Using Tsukuyomi on
your younger brother? That's enough…outta…you! You are weak, because
you don't have enough hatred. C'mon, Kisame! Wait! Why you—! Why did we have to retreat? You could have—! Sasuke… Even though Lord Third is dead, you still have people
who will protect you… I'll be waiting, Sasuke. Why are you so obsessed
with my brother? He's just a Rogue Ninja. That's because, unlike you… He's more of a brother to me
than you are to him… You've been trying to take Sasuke
back to the village. But what if it doesn't
go the way you want it to? I'll do anything to bring him back! You just said you consider
Sasuke to be like a brother… What if Sasuke were to attack
the Hidden Leaf Village? What would you do then? What? Why would Sasuke—? There's no way
he'd do something like that! Sasuke is still a blank canvas. He can easily be dyed
into any color. In that case,
would you be able to stop him? Even if you have to kill Sasuke? Could you weigh Sasuke against
the Hidden Leaf on a set of scales? I would defend the Leaf Village! And I would find a way to stop
Sasuke without killing him! You're such a child… What you speak of
are all fantasies. A shinobi must be capable of
making very harsh decisions. Someone else tried to tell me
the same thing before. But for me, there is no choice. I never go back on my word… That's my Ninja Way. I see. You've come… That Sharingan…
How much can you actually see? What I'm seeing right now… Is your death, Itachi. My death, huh? Well then… …make it happen. Forgive me, Sasuke… This is the end. You don't ever have to forgive me. I will love you always. I… I've made up my mind, Big Brother… All that's left…is them. So it really didn't
let the light through… Finally… Looks like it didn't affect
that black one. Sasuke! What do we do to release everyone
from the genjutsu?! Rinnegan genjutsu can be dealt with
using Rinnegan, probably. Which means we need
Sasuke's left eye. I won't let that happen. All that's left to do is to
get rid of you guys… Which I, the savior
of the world will do. Madara! That eye on his forehead! Be careful. We're surrounded in all directions
by four of his Shadows. I know that! I won't allow you to
do anything further. I just severed the Karmic Cycle
of this world. I have freed humankind from their suffering,
pain and their futility. But all this…is just a lie! Naruto, you're the one
who's interfering with everyone's happiness. Just look at this world now. All fighting between shinobi
has ceased. I've transformed hell into heaven. I've finally corrected
Hashirama's mistake. What do you mean by
the First Hokage's "mistake"? You Hidden Leaf may not
want to acknowledge it, but Hashirama ultimately failed
in reforming the Shinobi World. In the beginning, both Hashirama
and I had the same goals. And we worked together. We tried to change
the shinobi world that sent out barely grown
children out to war. The two of us created
the shinobi village. However, that does not result
in true peace. People cannot show
each other their true feelings. Fear, suspicion, and resentment… …never subside. FIRE
LIGHTNING WIND
EARTH WATER

 FIRE
LIGHTNING WIND
EARTH WATER

My opinions were pushed aside FIRE
LIGHTNING WIND
EARTH WATER

and the Shinobi World moved forward and the Shinobi World moved forward in accordance with
Hashirama's vision. And what happened because of it? The fighting between shinobi
hasn't stopped. Rather than ceasing, establishing ninja villages led to an increase in
their military build-up, which resulted in battles
that turned into great wars… with countless lives lost. The battling in what became
the First Great Ninja War… The Second Great Ninja War… The Third Great Ninja War… The fighting never stopped. That is Hashirama's legacy
to the Shinobi World. Although I admit that I triggered
this Fourth Great Ninja War… That's right! Because of you,
so many people died! I did make a proposition to peacefully hand over
the Tailed Beasts. Right now, everyone is
inside the Divine Tree. Each one of them,
dreaming their own idyllic dreams. They are in their own ideal worlds. Is this your idea of
a perfect world? You're just deceiving people. I just want to be the savior that ends the long history of
fighting amongst shinobi. Just know this… It's all over. You're wrong, Madara. You are not the savior… Nor is this the end of things… I can't…move… What's going on? How can you say that you,
unlike Obito, are able to completely
take advantage of others? Isn't that presumptuous to think
that you alone are different? My dear Madara… You have also been inside
a phantom dream… Inside a dream that I concocted. Black Zetsu… What are you saying? I created you. You are my will incarnate! Wrong again… My will is… Kaguya's! What the hell is going on? They're having a falling out,
at this stage in the game? No, that's not it. He just mentioned Kaguya. Huh? Kaguya? What is that? The one the Sage of
the Six Paths mentioned. The current Madara is
a prime example of that… He's become just like
my mother, Kaguya. He's obtained Ten Tails' power
and is getting close to me… and is trying to attain even
my mother Kaguya's power. In time, my mother's power
eventually gave rise to hubris… And the populace came to fear
the existence of that power. No way… What is it?! Is their chakra being absorbed? What's up with this guy? This chakra is ridiculous! All of Madara's shadows that were
surrounding us have disappeared! Something's about to happen! It's chakra! Is he absorbing all the chakra
that's erupting from the ground? Where is all this thick potent
chakra coming from? It's probably from everyone trapped
in the Infinite Tsukuyomi! This is really bad, Sasuke! This chakra is much stronger
than Ten Tails'! Stop them before they move! Go, Naruto! You mean while they're
still swelling up, right? Like two moths flying
into the flame… I'm going to absorb all the chakra
out of the two of you right now. Damn it! Don't, Sakura! But! Action without a plan
is meaningless. Damn it! I can't move! Sasuke! If we don't stop him now… He'll drain everyone else's chakra
before ours and they'll all die! Don't worry,
no one is going to die. Even when Kaguya previously cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi
upon the populace, she kept them alive and preserved… …in order to form them
into her soldiers. "Form"? What do you mean?! You seem to be denser than Itachi. How can one use
ordinary people in combat? You're not saying that—! She converted them
into White Zetsu. What's left of those who were under
the previous Infinite Tsukuyomi… That's what White Zetsu are. They've been transformed
ever so slowly over time. Are you saying everyone's gonna
turn into those white things?! What are you saying, Black Zetsu? The Infinite Tsukuyomi
is an Uchiha Jutsu! One that brings eternal peace
to the shinobi world. And what do you base that on? The Sage of the Six Paths…
carved that into the stone tablet. My dear Madara… I have been around
for eons longer than you. Since finding the stone tablet
left by Hagoromo, I've had quite some time
to make revisions. Did you say "revisions"? The Infinite Tsukuyomi
is not a jutsu that confers peaceful dreams. It is a jutsu to amass
enormous amounts of chakra from individuals enslaved in it. For what purpose? You acted merely for that purpose. According to my…
rather, Kaguya's will. I wouldn't!
For that?! Just as you used Obito as a pawn… You too, were merely a pawn. Hey!
Look at how big he swelled up! He's bloated because his body can't tolerate
the amount of chakra he absorbed! At this rate,
he's going to explode! Why? Why did this happen—? Hashirama…
Where…did I go wrong? He's shrinking?! Obito! Isn't she the one
Super Gramps talked about? Otsutsuki… Kaguya! Who is she?

 And why did Madara
suddenly become her?

 This chakra is far greater
then Madara's!

 I can't believe such
a person ever existed!

 Hagoromo knew she would appear,
that's why he gave us…

 Sakura, do not make
any inadvertent moves right now.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
She of the Beginning


 What are your intentions?!


 SHE OF THE BEGINNING


 Tune in again!

 Many countless nights passed… FIRE


Many countless nights passed… WIND

Chakra had been dispersed
to those who were unworthy. EARTH

The seal that caused
such deep humiliation… LIGHTNING

The seal that caused
such deep humiliation… WATER


…has now been shattered. May the infinite moonlight guide you… Use my body… and become one again! Awaken, god almighty! Progenitor of chakra! Thus concludes the tale of revival… It's chakra! This is really bad, Sasuke! This chakra is much stronger
than Ten Tails'! Stop them before they move! Like two moths flying into the flame… I'm going to absorb all the chakra out of the two
of you right now. Damn it! Isn't she… Isn't she the one Super Gramps
talked about? Kaguya…Otsutsuki?! She of the Beginning


 Sasuke! Sasuke! Naruto! The way they are currently,
those two can manage… But Sakura… Don't make any careless
moves right now! These two… are Hagoromo and Hamura's… No, rather they're… Indra and Ashura's… So it was Hagoromo
who gave them the jutsu… Sasuke! Naruto! Thank goodness! Who is she? And why did Madara
suddenly become her? This chakra is far greater
than Madara's… I can't believe such
a person ever existed. Hagoromo knew she would appear, that's why he entrusted us with— Obito… What are your intentions? Ninshu… No, you said shinobi… It's futile to speak to you about that, when all you do is just tamper
with chakra, without knowing its true meaning. This place, this land… is my precious nursery. I cannot let it be damaged further. Let us stop fighting… Then… Here that is… I shall erase… You all here… No way! Is that lava below? Is this a genjutsu? No… This feels… different! Summoning Jutsu! Sasuke! Over there! What're you doing?
Help them, not me! How did you…? Kakashi tied one end of a scroll onto
a kunai and used it like a rope. For Obito, he just pinned him
to the wall with a kunai, however… Way to go, Kakashi Sensei! Obito… Sorry for being rough with you… Oh! It wasn't a genjutsu, after all… Don't tell me… She summoned a different dimension? Eyes forward, Naruto. Naruto… I'm going to be frank with you… This world will come to an end
if either one of us dies. Only your Six Paths Power
of the Light Style and my Six Paths Power
of the Shadow Style, can seal away that being
in front of us. If we don't succeed, mankind will perish. We can't afford to die,
no matter what… When the Infinite Tsukuyomi
was launched… Kakashi and Sakura just happened
to be near you… That's just how it is. You understand
what that means, right? I know. I get what you're saying
and I know that you're right. But…this is also a situation when
your body just moves on its own… Like that time on the bridge. Sasuke, you…! Why did you protect me? What's with that look? Loser… Why did you—?! For me—? You should have just minded
your own business! How should I know? My body just moved on its own… Well, never mind. I know that you get
what I mean, Sasuke. Sasuke's right. Back then… Maybe Sasuke acted subconsciously… Even so… Thank you…Naruto. Damn it! Damn it! Now's our chance! Byakugan! Damn it! My hawk's Chakra Points
have been hit! This calls for Susano'o! Madara's rods are… I can finally move… Now if… If I head to the spot where
I sensed that massive chakra… I might learn something. But…the chakra
suddenly dissipated. FOURTH HOKAGE
 They've disappeared…
Did they defeat Madara? I've got to get to Naruto… just one more time… Naruto, you—?! Huh? You can levitate? That's right… Madara, when he was enhanced
by Six Paths' chakra, also levitated… Shadow Clone Jutsu! Take care of Sakura and Kakashi Sensei. Six Paths' Chakra… You act triumphantly just because
you have a special accoutrement. However… No matter what kind of chakra… All chakra belongs to me
and me alone. Once more… …I shall reunify all chakra! Sasuke! Now! Sasuke! Damn it! I can't stop! Sasuke! Even Susano'o doesn't work. Let's get Obito while
we still have the chance. I forgot that you could use
Teleportation-like jutsu now. You had me worried there! It's like this foothold. We've both benefitted
from Six Paths' power. But having received it is meaningless
unless we seal her away. Yeah! My children, with whom
I shared my chakra… I can't move… Now…come to your mother… She's taking…our chakra, Sasuke! Kaguya seems to see
her two children… when she looks at the two of you. Isn't that sweet? She, who was sealed away
by her own children. Such a poor, pitiable mother… Why'd Six Paths Super Gramps
seal away his own mom? I thought he sealed away Ten Tails… It appears you have the wrong idea… Just who and what are you,
Black Zetsu? I am Kaguya's child. What?! His aura seems different,
all of a sudden… I recorded everything that happened
while Mother was gone. And molded it as well. The tale of shinobi… is the tale of restoring Mother. Huh?! What're you talking about?! What do you mean? Since you know Mother's name,
you must have met Hagoromo. I knew that it was possible, depending on
the power of the reincarnates. As well as receiving the power
to seal away Mother… But we're gonna seal away
the Ten Tails! It's rare to see the reincarnates
of Indra and Ashura cooperating this closely. You two know nothing. Let me tell you her tale while
I suck out all of your chakra. Like I told you earlier… Mother was sealed away previously
by her own children. Apparently, it was an extremely
powerful seal… The jutsu transformed Ten Tails into a Catastrophic Planetary
Devastation core… …and turned it into the moon. But just before the seal took hold,
she gave birth to me. In order that she could
one day be restored. I shall now show you two
all of that… I don't have any candy,
but the puppet show is about to begin. Are you saying that she came
from the heavens?

 Yes, this woman appeared in the spot
where the light had fallen…

 What is your name?

 Answer him!
The man standing before you

 is the King of the Land of Sou,
Lord Tenji!

 My name is…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,300
You're the one...
who hurt Sakura, Naruto. <i>Naruto...</i> <i>you...</i> <i>don't...remember anything...?</i> Then...that bridge...
and that crater... Yes, <i>you</i>  did it... And Sakura's wound as well...! That's right! Sakura didn't want
to hurt you... so she lied to you. I'm also responsible
for Sakura getting injured. And here I was assigned
to Team Kakashi... for a time like this... I have special powers... with which I can control
your Nine-Tails power. So you don't really
need to worry. At least...
while I'm by your side. In other words, I didn't have
to go to the trouble of telling you the truth
at this point... But why did I tell you? There's no doubt that
using that power might be a quick way for you
to save Sasuke. But strength gained
from relying on the Nine-Tails... is not your true power. You'll end up tormenting yourself
if you rely on the power... of the Nine-Tails from here on. And it could turn into a power
that hurts your friends. Like what happened this time. You should already have
vaguely picked up on it. But you didn't attempt to stop
the release of the power... That's because
you were impatient, right? I will now completely suppress
your Nine-Tails power. But you're sorely mistaken... if you think that will
make you weaker. You should be
sufficiently powerful... without having to rely
on that Chakra. I think you've got
the wrong idea about this. The source of your strength
isn't the Nine-Tails Chakra. It's the power of
your own Chakra... that can withstand the formidable
Nine-Tails Chakra. If you want to save Sasuke,
do it with your <i>own</i>  power. If you want to see Sasuke... do it with your <i>own</i>  eyes,
not the Nine-Tails'. And if you want
to protect Sakura... do it with your <i>own</i>  power,
not the Nine-Tails'! Right! <i>The Unfinished Page


</i> Kabuto... Take care of that
after we get back. No, you see... if I don't wash these off
as soon as possible, the cutting quality will deteriorate
just like that... <i>It's okay...
<i>The pain's starting to go away.</i> <i>Are Naruto and the captain
<i>still at it?</i> <i>Oh yeah...</i> <i>Come to think of it,
<i>the thing I picked up earlier...</i> <i>It's gone...</i> <i>Here it is...</i> Please go on ahead. I'll catch up once
I've tidied up. I'll help. This...isn't printed. Did you draw this, too? Yes. Wow, it's a picture book, huh? Can I take a look at it
along the way? I can't let you see it. It's not finished yet... And I don't hand this over
to people. This is my older brother's book, so... <i>Just as I thought, it's gone...</i> How can I...
be sure that's true? <i>I lost it back then, huh...?</i> Is something the matter, Sai? No... It's nothing... I see... More importantly,
Master Orochimaru... When we get back,
can you give me... an intact male corpse
as quickly as possible? Don't you still have
bodies in stock? Yes, I do... But I'm out of
the fifteen to sixteen-year-old... We lost one in
the incident earlier, so... It doesn't feel right... unless they are always stored properly
in order of age inside the scroll. Kabuto...
Are you type-A blood? No...I'm AB... I see...
That's surprising... Not really. Okay, shall we get going
pretty soon...? We have a little further to go
before reaching the hideout. First, take a look
at this diagram. This is a diagram of a formation
for cornering an enemy. In actual missions,
various scenarios can develop... depending on the number
of enemies and number of allies. First off... What's the deal... with this book...? And then...
in a scenario like this... Hey, are you liste-- Both of you,
come here a minute! Hurry! Is something wrong,
Sakura? Look at this. Oh! That's Sai's... That's the picture book
we picked up that Sai drew, huh? What's in it? If we figure that out, we might be able
to find out a little about Sai... Right. That's what I was thinking,
so I tried reading it, but... What kind of a story is it? Actually... I don't really know... Why? What do you mean? There are no words
or dialogue at all... You're right... It kind of... looks like a story about the two boys
on the front and back cover... And...it's got the story
of the two boys... starting from both title pages
of the book... and progressing to the middle... When you look at the book starting with
this boy with black hair... the next page... always has the same boy
on the right page... And there's a different person
drawn on each left page... See...? Huh...?! This is... Go back! I knew it... This kid...looks a little different
when you go to the next page. You're right... And look... He has the same weapon as
the guy drawn on the previous page... Hmm, it looks like it's a story
where the boy defeats enemies... Look at this... After fighting, he takes the enemy's weapon
and armor... Just as I thought... The next page...
and the next page, too... Oh, come to think of it! I knew it... The positioning is reversed... but this boy with the white hair
is the same, too. So it's a story where these boys
grow by battling enemies, huh...? Just a minute... If they're defeating enemies
from both sides... then what happens at the end?! That's the problem. Look... What's up with...this picture? This is a strange picture. In this picture book... only the facing pages
in the middle are incomplete... This is...kind of creepy... He said it wasn't finished... But why isn't there a face
drawn in...? Doesn't...the guy with
the black hair... kind of look like Sai? You're right. Did he draw himself...? Then who is this boy...
with the white hair? <i>I can't let you see it.
<i>It's not finished yet.</i> <i>And I don't hand this over
<i>to people.</i> <i>This is my older brother's book, so...</i> Could it be... It's Sai's...
older brother...? <i>If you have a brother,
<i>you should be able to imagine</i> <i>what it would be like
<i>to lose him, right?</i> <i>Yeah, well...you could say that...</i> <i>My brother's dead, after all.</i> Then this... These facing pages
in the center... It's Sai...and his older brother... Let's go. Yes, sir. <i>Over there, huh...?</i> Sai's older brother...
Don't tell me! <i>Could it be...?!</i> It appears my clone
has located the hideout. Let's get going. <i>That's...</i> You're late... What's this feeling?
What's this chill and sweat? I'm not supposed to have
any emotions. Don't tell me that just by looking
into his eyes for an instant I feared him within the depths of
my soul that even I can't perceive?! Is he Sasuke Uchiha, the man Naruto has continued
to search for all this time?! Next time:
"Infiltration: The Den of the Snake!" The tale of shinobi…
is the tale of restoring Mother. I shall now show you two… I don't have any candy, but the puppet show
is about to begin… Kaguya Otsutsuki

 Look at that! It's glowing!
It looks suspicious! What is it? Is it a star? That's no star, it's moving! How terrifying! Follow it! Yes, sir! A woman? And you're saying that
she came from the heavens? Yes… This woman appeared in the spot
where the light had fallen. Be careful! Hmm…
What is your name? Answer him! The man standing before you is
the King of the Land of Sou, Lord Tenji! You there! The Land of Ka must have
sent this woman to spy on us! Interrogate her and
make her confess! - Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir! Wait. You—! What did you do?! What's the matter? My name is Kaguya. Kagu…ya? I am the one who protects
the Divine Tree. I have been assigned to
take care of your needs. I am Aino… Lady Kaguya? Several millennia ago,
that tree appeared out of nowhere and grew into a massive tree
before our very eyes. But I have heard
frightening rumors too. Anyone who approaches it is quickly
consumed by a demon spirit and dies like a withered branch. Forgive me for speaking
of such things! Do not worry.
For it is true… Huh? And some day… Lord Tenji! Ministers Suzaku and Genbu from
the Land of Ka are here to see you. This is the border between
the Land of Ka and the Land of Sou. The issue is this lake. Presently, this region is said to be
part of the Land of Sou… But an ancient manuscript
was recently discovered. On it, has been recorded
from time immemorial, that this land was originally within
the Land of Ka's territory. We wish to have this land
returned to us. But that lake is our source of water
for our farmlands in the Land of Sou. If I were to return that land… No matter what situation arises, to return what was stolen
to its true owner… is the right thing to do. If we do not receive
a favorable answer, we cannot be responsible
for whatever misfortune befalls the Land of Sou! Now, now… I'm sure you will need some time
to prepare and take care of things. We shall return in a few days
to hear your answer. By the way, I understand you have taken
a celestial maiden as a concubine. I hear she is indescribably
beautiful and mysterious. I am most curious to see her. Without a doubt, this recently discovered artifact
is a fabrication by the Land of Ka. I am aware of that… The Land of Ka makes false claims
against neighboring lands as a pretext to war. That's how they've
expanded their lands. This case is no different. But they have an army three times
greater than the Land of Sou. There is no way we can win. Suzaku and Genbu… Sending those two
as messengers means… The Land of Ka is serious. We cannot be meek— Lord Tenji, let's stand up to them! If we are doomed anyway, let's go down fighting and
show them the pride of the Sou! Do not panic just yet. Lord Tenji! What is Kaguya doing? Lady Kaguya spends her days
looking up at the sky like that. It's as though she's waiting for
someone to come for her… According to the villagers, they say Lady Kaguya
came from the heavens… The thing is…I don't remember
my first encounter with Kaguya. Oh? May I borrow that? Huh?
Oh this? You must be freezing, standing in
the cold night air for so long. I wonder if that glowing world above
is always beautiful and at peace… A strange feeling comes over me
as I gaze up at the night sky… The fact that such a beautiful light
lies afloat in pitch darkness… Just what is it?
Will I ever be able to go there? I hear that you gaze up
at the sky every night… Are you waiting for someone? It's all right if that's the case. From now on, whenever you're
lonely and look up at the sky, I shall be by your side. Is there anything that you desire? What I wish…is for peace
with no more fighting. Peace…huh? They're from the Land of Ka! Why that—!
They're messing with us! Don't! Can't you see they're just
trying to provoke us?! Damn it! Lord Tenji! The mischief caused by
the Land of Ka at our border is growing steadily worse! Unless we take action… the farmers' ire will
reach a breaking point! I understand… But I forbid you to confront
the Land of Ka. But—! I seek peace. If fighting ensues, many will die. We must move forward with peaceful
negotiations with the Land of Ka. Anyone who makes a move
on the Land of Ka will be executed on my order. What is he thinking? Is Lord Tenji here? Yes…
He comes nearly every night. It seems Lady Kaguya has come to
accept his presence recently, and they've been spending more
and more time together. I didn't ask you for details! Lord Tenji! Lord Tenji! What do you want at this hour? The Land of Ka is at the border
with a large army! What?! Kaguya… I must depart for
the front immediately. To war? No, this is for peace. But if things should go wrong… Prepare to go into hiding right away! Yes! Do not worry.
I shall return right away. Let's go! Yes! Guard the castle. Leave it to us. So that Kaguya has left
the capital of Sou… This is the perfect opportunity
to capture that woman. There's no need to rush. The Land of Sou
will be ours in no time. It's just one woman…
Be patient. It's my policy to get what I want
as fast as I can. You're hopeless… Gather skilled men.
We're going after Kaguya. Yes, sir! You can't sleep? I'll stay with you. Enemy attack!
Alert! Lady Kaguya! Lady Aino! What's going on? So this is where you were hiding! Who are you?! You dare approach knowing that
this lady is Lord Tenji's concubine?! Tenji? I'm from the Land of Ka,
why should I care about him? The Land of Sou will fall very soon. To put it bluntly, what belongs to
Tenji will soon belong to me. The rumors were right…
such a beauty. And very refined. From this moment on, you are mine! Lady Kaguya, please run! Lady Kaguya… Like you can escape! Lady Kaguya! Even in this situation,
you're not scared… Well, that just makes me
like you more! Take her! Do not touch me. Don't back off! So the bewitching beauty
is actually a monster… Th-The Land of Sou
is really doomed now… I would like you to withdraw
your troops immediately. You seem to be under
the wrong impression, Lord Tenji. We are not at war. This army is just to
protect our boundary. Such a large army just to
protect the boundary is… I do not intend to wage war either. There's proof in the fact that I have ordered anyone who draws
his sword against the Land of Ka to be executed immediately. Oh, is that so? Then I want you to execute Kaguya. This woman known as Kaguya killed
my vassal, and then tried to kill me! Impossible… Kaguya would never—! If you think I'm lying,
ask this woman. Is it true? Yes. Lady Kaguya… dispatched the soldiers of Ka
with frightening power… Lord Tenji! Unless you behead Kaguya,
this war will not end! I'm leaving. What happened to you? That woman Kaguya…
is a horrible monster. Leave the witch-hunt to them… And in the interim,
we'll conquer everything. Kaguya did this? Whatever the reason, there seems to be no doubt that
she tried to kill Sir Suzaku. Kaguya… What are you going to do,
Lord Tenji?! Are you really going to
execute Lady Kaguya? Unless I give them her head,
war will not be averted… Are you really willing to do that? Send all troops after Kaguya… Leave no stone unturned. Find her. I have no other choice… Are they… …pursuers? They're from the Land of Sou! So Lord Tenji dispatched them! Let us hurry.
My fate is with the Divine Tree! Lady Kaguya! If you explain
what happened to Lord Tenji, I'm certain that he will forgive you… Lady Kaguya… My strength… Lady Kaguya!
Could you be…with child? This is terrible! How could Lord Tenji—?! I must get to the Divine Tree… Please go…
I will stop them. Wait! Lord Tenji!
Please order your soldiers to retreat! Lady Kaguya is with… Aino! …with your child, Lord Tenji! Lady Kaguya… Please bear…a healthy… Aino! It's now time to destroy
the Land of Sou! Onward! The Land of Sou will now be ours. Kaguya… Kaguya! Shine upon the world,
Infinite Tsukuyomi! What is this? Kaguya… What…are…you? I shall rule over this world…
Together with my children. Mother loved this world.
 She tried to love humans.
 But that hope was dashed.
 She personally ate
the fruit of the Divine Tree
 to try and protect her children.
 But real despair started there…
 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Hagoromo and Hamura"

 Shortly after,
Mother gave birth to twins.

 HAGOROMO AND HAMURA

 Tune in again!

 Hagoromo and Hamura

 Mother loved this world.
She tried to love humans. But her wish was dashed so she ate the fruit of the Divine Tree
to try to protect her children. However… Mother's real tale of despair
begins from here… Shortly afterwards,
Mother gave birth to twins. They were…Hagoromo and Hamura. Mother looks up at the sky
like that every day… I wonder what she's looking for? She never tells us anything.
No one knows what's in her heart. Perhaps she has feelings that even we,
her own sons, cannot fathom. Hey, Hagoromo and Hamura!
Please come with me! What's the matter, Haori? If you use all the water at your place, there won't be any water
downstream for the rice paddies. That's not my fault! Wait!
What's going on? I'll tell ya what's going on!
This guy is taking all the water! My paddy's upstream,
so I can't help it! But until now, wasn't there
enough water for everyone? Well, all of a sudden,
the flow of the river's gotten weak. Did something happen upstream? I would go and check, but there's a huge bear
roaming around this mountain. You gotta be really careful. Just recently, an old lady went
foraging for edible wild plants, and got hurt really bad. All right. We'll go check. Really? That'd be great! Be careful, Hagoromo. We'll be fine. Let's go, Hamura. Right. See anything? Hold on a minute. There's a huge boulder upstream. I see… So this is what's blocking
the flow of the river. But where did this boulder
come from? It wasn't there the last time
we were up here. Either it fell from somewhere,
or someone put it there. What do you bean by "someone"? No one can move a boulder this big other than Mother and you,
Elder Brother. I put it there. Hey, don't brush me off
like I'm some sort of bug… ‘Cuz I'm not a bug… I'm a toad. Hey, am I going crazy? There's a toad trying to
make bad jokes… Well, Elder Brother,
it must mean I'm going crazy too. No, you're not going crazy.
I really am talking to you. But if you think my jokes aren't funny,
then that's a little crazy. No one's hiding around here… It's not some
Ventriloquism Jutsu either. You're pretty wary for a human. You're pretty arrogant for a toad. We toads have lived here
far longer than you. You just don't know it. A talking toad… You think people will be happy
if we captured it and took it home? Fool! Do you really think you both
can catch me? For a toad, you sure talk big… It seems we have a guest. That's a huge bear! Perfect timing.
I'll show you just how strong I am. I placed this boulder here
so I could meet you two. My name is Gamamaru. And you two are Hagoromo
and Hamura, right? A toad just addressed us
by our first names… Come with me, you two. Oops, I almost forgot. Oh…
Not bad. Why did you bring us here? Do you know what that is? Of course. That's the Peak of Demise. Have you ever seen
what's beyond that? No, never. Mother has warned us
not to go near that peak. Everyone must follow that law. No one has ever seen
what's on the other side. The truth behind the Divine Tree
is beyond that peak. The truth behind the Divine Tree? The Divine Tree has been
absorbing the power of this land. As long as that tree exists,
the land will continue to weaken. Is that true? But I've heard that it's because of
the power of the Divine Tree that this land has thrived. You're wrong! If you want to know the truth, go see what's on the other side
of that peak. Later! "The truth"? Is Lady Kaguya really not here? How many times must I tell you?
She's not here. Welcome home,
Masters Hagoromo and Hamura. What's the matter? This man is very persistent. Who are you? I'm a traveling medicine peddler. I wanted to do some business here and came to get
Lady Kaguya's permission. Where is Mother? She said she would be away tonight. I see, so she's gone out again. She's been away a lot lately. What do I do now? Well now, what do you have here? Let me take a look
at your medicines. What are you doing to
my products?! These are just weeds
and moldy nuts… This one's a poisonous mushroom. If you take these,
you'll get even sicker. You're just a snake oil salesman… This village has our mother,
my elder brother and me. We can cure any illness anywhere,
at anytime. No one will buy stuff like this. Your power…
Is it from the Divine Tree? Just get out of here…
or you'll be sorry. Damn it!
How dare they belittle me! They made me so mad,
my back pain is flaring up again. The Divine Tree, huh? If I take even just a small branch,
I could sell it for a fortune… Yes! While the devil is away… Just forget about it. Don't be foolish enough
to go near the Divine Tree. You'll die. You are—! I apologize for earlier. My younger brother
is quite hot-tempered. What do you want?! Oww! I want to ask you something. Are you joking?! You're not getting
anything out of me! If you answer me,
I'll heal your back. Like doing that will cure anything. If it's that simple,
no one would go through… What? The pain's gone?! Hey! You really did fix my back! So, will you answer my questions? Yes! Anything! You've traveled to
many different places, correct? Oh, yes.
That's how I make my living. Have you ever seen
what's beyond that peak? No, I haven't.
But I've seen many other lands… What do they say about
my mother in other lands? Well, that's…um… Tell me even if
it's something negative. Okay. There are rumors about people
rebelling here and there, over Lady Kaguya's
Ritual of the Divine Tree. And in order to suppress them, Lady Kaguya has
annihilated the instigators. Lately, rumors are swirling that
Lady Kaguya is just a tyrant… "Annihilated"? No wonder Mother has been
away a lot… Leave, and never return.
It's for your own good. Yes, sir! Everything is going well. Elder Brother? Hmm?
Oh good, no news is good news. Elder Brother, are you still thinking
about what that toad said? No… It's not about that, but… They're part of the Ritual
of the Divine Tree… No way! Elder Brother! Haori! Hagoromo…
Hamura… What's going on? I've received notice
to serve the Divine Tree. But—! I have no choice. This is a ceremony that Lady Kaguya
established eons ago… Hagoromo, Hamura… It was only for a short time,
but I'm glad I got to meet you two. Please remember me. Haori! Mother… Please end
the Ritual of the Divine Tree. That is not possible. But—! I will not tolerate any defiance,
even if you are my sons. Then please tell me… What happens to those who go to
the Divine Tree as part of this ritual? Why does no one ever return? This ritual is necessary…
until the others arrive. "The others"? You don't need to know
about them just yet. Hagoromo, Hamura…
I am leaving once more. Take care of things in my absence. Yes. Elder Brother…
You're not thinking of… Yes, I intend to climb that peak. If Mother finds out, you'll get
into a great deal of trouble. I'm prepared for the consequences. Okay, Elder Brother.
I'm coming with you. What is this?! Elder Brother! Hamura! What's wrong? Elder Brother!
Can you deal with this cocoon? Haori! Haori! Wake up, Haori! Elder Brother… It's no use… She's dead. So this is…the truth behind
the Ritual of the Divine Tree. Elder Brother! Your eyes! Come out, Gamamaru! It seems like you went
beyond that peak… Come with me. Where are we? This is the Land of Toads. What is this…strange power I feel? Oh… I'm impressed that a human
can feel the power here. The natural power known as
Sage Power flows freely here. And so, if you use this power… Even I can do something like this. Wow… Follow me! This is known as the Memory Stone. "Memory Stone"? Everything that occurs aboveground
is recorded in this stone… Look at what happened in the past… Long ago, that tree fell
from the sky… And, as if in pursuit, your mother
Kaguya appeared here. And when your mother arrived, she fell in love with
the emperor of this land and she became pregnant with you. However, Kaguya's destiny with humans
was to be trifled by them and in the end,
she became their enemy. Kaguya acquired the power
of the Divine Tree, and your father,
along with his people, were sacrificed to it. But, to make sure
mankind didn't perish, she revived some of the humans, erased their memories
and put them back. Only Kaguya knows the truth. Where is Mother from anyway? Why does she protect
the Divine Tree? I don't know. Perhaps it's related to the fact that
she appeared from far up in the sky. One thing is clear… Since the Divine Tree took root, the Nature Energy of this land
is being depleted. How could that happen? Not just from the land…
but from humans too. As long as that Divine Tree exists… this great land will wither,
and we will suffer the same fate. We must speak with mother. Will she even listen to us? Hagoromo,
your mother's power is immense. I doubt that you can
confront her directly. Even if you are her son. Gamamaru, will you teach me
how to use Sage Power? Elder Brother! You're not planning to fight Mother,
are you?! It's just in case… I see… If you, who inherited Kaguya's power,
acquire Sage Power… you could definitely take her on. – However…
– What is it? Teaching you Sage Power
is very risky. Why is that? Is there any guarantee that
after acquiring Sage Power, you won't become the same
as your mother? Gamamaru… After coming this far,
have you become scared? What did you say? You're contradicting yourself. Why did you lie in wait for us, then? You planned to pit us against Mother
and make us fight from the very start. You're pretty shrewd for a human,
aren't you? Yes, I had a revelation. Revelation? Yes, a dream.
Toads rarely, if ever, dream. But that dream was
more like a prophecy… I dreamed of you battling Kaguya. How did it end? I don't think his dream
went that far. If it did,
he wouldn't be so nervous. Wha—?! How can you see so far
into a toad's heart so clearly… Just who are you? Clear your mind… Just feel the Nature Energy
and take it into yourself. He's a surprise… Hagoromo's acquired Sage Power
in no time at all. Mother!
You're back so soon… Where is Hagoromo? Elder Brother is still out
patrolling the village… Hamura! Hiding things from me is useless. It's useless…even if you try to
repel me with your Byakugan… My Byakugan is far more
superior to yours. You two broke the law,
and went to the peak, didn't you?

 Hiding things from me is useless.

 I can read your thoughts
and feelings.

 Then why?

 You must know why we're
angry with you, Mother.

 It seems that you were in love
with that young girl…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Fabricated Past"


 Mother, even you must have
believed in that in the past!


 A FABRICATED PAST


 Tune in again!


 A Fabricated Past I think… I've mastered Sage Power. Well, you just might be able
to take Kaguya on. A Messenger Toad? What?! What happened? Kaguya has returned and they're not
able to contact Hamura anymore. Then… It's safe to assume that
she has seen through our plans. The moment of confrontation
has now arrived. Forgive me, everyone! But this is the only way
to save this land. This is far enough. Any closer, and it would
be dangerous. Go and hide somewhere. If you and Kaguya fight… …I can't begin to imagine
the scope of the battle. This is for the both of you. What is this tag? SAGE SAGE
Do you feel its enormous power? It's a treasure that
has been passed down in the Land of Toads. It is forbidden to take it
outside of our land, but our lives are also on the line. There is Sage Power
infused in that tag. Our ancestors sacrificed
their lives to make it. Use it when you don't have time
to replenish your Sage Power. It can only be used once,
but it can revive you, even if you're on the verge
of death. I am indebted to you. I will pray for you and
your brother's success. Mother. Hagoromo… You two broke the law and
went to that peak, didn't you? Hiding things from me
is useless. I can read your thoughts
and feelings. Then you must know
why we're angry with you, Mother. It seems you were in love
with that young girl… Not just her… But everyone from this land,
every single one of them… I loved them all, Mother. I also found out what
you did in the past. Why would you do
such a terrible thing? You both don't know
how dreadful they can be. That is why an army is necessary. They're your soldiers? Mother, just what are you? Where did you come from? I come… from a place
far, far away in the sky… A place where you two
can never go. But someday, they will come
to take me back. Love doesn't work on them… They only understand power. Still… even you must have believed
in love in the past?! We are proof of that love. But… my love was also betrayed. Lady Kaguya! My strength… Lady Kaguya is with… Aino! And now, I am to be betrayed
by the two for whom I risked my life,
and shared my power with. Mother, please feel the power
of love once more… and stop the Ritual of
the Divine Tree! I will not. Mother! I protected you,
and nurtured you all this time. It seems it was all for naught. We will never see eye to eye. So, Hagoromo… I am taking back…that power. Hamura! Mother! What did you do to Hamura?! Hagoromo, if this love
you speak of is real… you will not be
able to kill Hamura. Snap out of it, Hamura! I'm not your enemy! So she took Hamura as a hostage! If he stays on the defense
the whole time, even Hagoromo will… What's he planning on doing? Forgive me, Hamura! Elder Brother! I… Mother was controlling you. I messed up, didn't I? Don't talk.
I'll heal your wound. SAGE
 Damn it… Using the Secret Treasure of
the Toads for that purpose… The wound is healed! What did you do, Elder Brother? If we make it out of this alive,
thank Gamamaru. Hagoromo… Hamura! Mother… I am indebted to you. You enabled me to awaken
my Mangekyo Sharingan and Rinnegan. What is that? Elder Brother! Look! What in the world is that? I feel an enormous power… And that is how Hagoromo
and Hamura's battle with my mother Kaguya began. This is where
the real battle started. Mother had the power
of the Divine Tree. In order to protect Mother, the Divine Tree turned
into the Ten Tails. The Ten Tails was not
just the Divine Tree, but also my mother herself. It was not just the manifestation
of the Divine Tree trying to take back chakra… It was the will of my mother
trying to take back the chakra she had shared
with her two sons. The intense fighting between
my mother and the brothers continued for months. It took a massive toll
on the land. And at long last,
the decisive moment came to be. Hagoromo and Hamura's powers
overcame Mother's. Now, Elder Brother! Catastrophic Planetary Devastation! Mother gathered up every ounce
of energy she had left, and just before the seal took hold,
she gave birth to me. You…came out of her? Even Hagoromo did not
know of this truth… Nor was he aware that I was working on
her behalf to restore her. I split the Ten Tails
into nine souls. When you look at them like this,
they're very cute. What will you do with them? I will take care of
these Tailed Beasts. I will raise them to trust humans
and to help them. Elder Brother, I think I'm going
to stay by Mother. Hamura? When I was being controlled, Mother's consciousness
was present inside of me. I felt her emotions. Mother was afraid all
of the time. In order to protect us, Mother only did what
she thought she had to do… It made me feel that she was just
a woman, alone all by herself. I guess I love Mother, after all. Hamura… You are a kind soul. Elder Brother… I will always be up there
in the sky… watching over the world
you create. Come visit once in a while. We won't be that far apart. I will. Take care of yourself. And so, that's how the battle between
my mother and the brothers ended. But I was left, with no power at all. That is why I went deep
into the darkness, and carefully planned
my mother's revival. In the meantime, Hagoromo
was ignorant of all of this and raised Indra and Ashura. He even created that Ninshu,
Ninja Creed nonsense. Time passed and Hagoromo died… And just before passing away, he scattered the Tailed Beasts
to various parts of this world. Two things are required
to revive Mother… The Divine Tree and Infinite Tsukuyomi
by means of Rinnegan. But the Rinnegan requires
Hagoromo's chakra, which he passed on
to Indra and Ashura. And the Tailed Beasts,
which form the Ten Tails, were scattered across the world. In order to bring Mother back,
all of these things had to be collected. You can't imagine the amount time
that was required to do this. So first of all,
in order to regain Hagoromo's chakra, I took advantage of Indra who
lost the fight over succession. I tempted Indra. And later,
I selected Indra's descendants, the Uchiha to be
the cast of my tale. I revised the stupid script that
Hagoromo wrote just a little bit. You mean…?! That's right.
Hagoromo's Stone Tablet… I rewrote it to say
the Infinite Tsukuyomi was the path to save
the Uchiha. I must say… You Uchiha performed
your parts brilliantly. Why you—! Indra and the Uchiha. Ashura and the Senju. I was able to set up a pattern
of fighting and power seeking. Furthermore, time after time, I'd approach the reincarnate of
Indra and Ashura in each clan… to attempt Rinnegan manifestation. But it always ended in failure. Just with that alone,
a thousand years passed. But when Madara Uchiha and
Hashirama Senju were reincarnated, I came to believe… that Madara could achieve it. That this was the first step
towards Mother's revival. However… Madara Uchiha lost
to Hashirama Senju… I thought I had to go back
to the drawing board. But Fate did not turn
her back on me… Madara's corpse is like
a treasure trove to a shinobi. Tobirama, who had been studying
the mysteries of the Sharingan, stopped short of disposing his corpse. And instead, hid Madara deep
within the mountains of the Leaf Village. But Madara was no fool… He figured that if he lost
to Senju in battle, Tobirama would not
get rid of his body. So he placed a jutsu
on himself. You can invoke a time-delay spell
in one's eye using the Mangekyo Sharingan. Just like the way Itachi
implanted the Amaterasu with a time delay in you, Sasuke. Madara had installed
the Izanagi in his right eye. At the cost of his right eye, Madara rewrote reality
and returned to life. He then passed off
a shadow clone as his corpse. He vomited the flesh
he bit off of Hashirama, and grafted it on his wound. After that, Madara awakened
his Rinnegan… and summoned the Gedo Statue. He then cultured Hashirama's flesh
using the Gedo Statue, in an attempt to prolong
his life further. Those goblins, the White Zetsu, seemed to be an incidental
by-product of that. But they were actually the people
put under the last Infinite Tsukuyomi, whom I extracted from the statue. I just made it look that way. "Two polar opposites
operating together gives rise to all things
in this universe." Just as it was inscribed
in the Stone Tablet, Madara solidified his attachment
to Hashirama. I began formulating a plan… to collect the Tailed Beasts
by making it look like I was born out of Madara,
and to also manipulate Obito. I formed the Akatsuki and
steered them towards war. In order to increase
battle strength, I deliberately let Kabuto
discover Madara's corpse… And in addition, I guided him to use Madara's corpse
as a bargaining chip, and made Obito cooperate. This war went exactly as I planned. The Infinite Tsukuyomi was
launched during this war… And by amassing a large amount
of the human chakra that had been scattered… Mother was restored. I detest you… Hagoromo… Hamura… You are mine. My role has come to an end.

 You shall return with me to
the almighty god that is mother.

 You two alone aren't
the entirety of shinobi history!

 Besides, moms are supposed
to be happy
 
 about their kids
leaving the nest!

 Your teenage rebellion continues…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The No. 1 Most Unpredictable Ninja"

 You brats can't hope
to accomplish anything.
 
 
 THE NO. 1 MOST UNPREDICTABLE NINJA

 
 Tune in again! 
 

 I… detest you. Hagoromo… Hamura… You… are mine. My role has come to an end. You shall return with me to
the almighty god that is Mother. You two aren't… You two alone aren't the entirety
of shinobi history! Besides… moms are supposed to be happy
about their kids leaving the nest! That's what being a mom means! Your teenage rebellion continues. Mother is the very progenitor of chakra. You brats can't hope to
accomplish anything. Naruto, we need to make an opening,
so we can launch the Sealing Jutsu. Yeah! And the only thing that will work… is that jutsu! The No. 1 Most Unpredictable Ninja


 "That" jutsu? Yeah… Sasuke, hear me out. I don't know what you're scheming,
but Mother absorbs all jutsu. Your actions are meaningless. How is it going? Looks like they're just staring
each other down. I see… The power to forcefully drag us all
into this dimension, that isn't genjutsu… This is on a totally different scale. She's like… …a god. How do you plan on fighting
someone like that, Naruto? This could be the end… But we gotta give it our best shot. Just like we've been
doing all along, right? Are you serious? We won't know unless we try. I've been secretly
practicing this jutsu even more than the Rasengan,
ya know?! It's worth giving it a shot, right? If there's a chance
it'll create an opening… Fine. I'll get my left eye ready. Let's do it! Yeah! Amaterasu! They're making a move! Take this! Sexy Jutsu: - Reverse Harem Jutsu!
- Reverse Harem Jutsu! Sexy-type jutsu tend to work better
on stronger opponents, ya know! That idiot! Using a jutsu like that
in this situation?! That might work on me,
but there's no way that jutsu will work on someone so god-like! It worked?! You may be the progenitor
of chakra or whatever… But I'll bet you've never seen
a jutsu like this! This is the history of shinobi, ya fool! The number one most unpredictable… Don't tell me that
Naruto's Pervy Ninjutsu is going to save the world! I believe that Naruto is
the Child of Prophecy who will save the world. Perhaps he's a throwback to another age
in the Leaf's Shinobi Way. He's more like me than Minato,
and he can be very endearing. Master Jiraiya, are you watching?! Now, Naruto! Right! It's cold! What's going on?! Ice? It changed! This place…
Did we shift dimensions again? Whose jutsu effects are
we seeing, Naruto? Huh?! Uh, this is probably… It feels the same as the time
we were taken to that previous lava world. There's no mistake that
this is our enemy's ability. To be able to rewrite the world
in an instant and make it reality… This really is just like genjutsu. An ice world this time?! On what principle? She vanished! This ability… Can she move across dimensions? Why that—! Amaterasu! Flame Control! Thanks, Sasuke! Sorry the Sexy Jutsu didn't work. I never really expected that
kind of jutsu would work. This time, we're going
with my strategy… Help me out. Mother… These two
are quite annoying. Why don't you split them
up already… and take them on separately? Where am I? Sasuke! Damn it! Now you won't be able to
seal Mother away. First, I'll suck out all
of your chakra! You have nice reflexes. First, I have to find Sasuke! This child is fast. So I guess I won't be able to tell
where she's gonna strike from… What is that? Is it possible that… we're the only ones
who were brought to this world? No. The real me is here too. But I can't sense Sasuke. Where am I? Obito! Is that you, Kakashi? I thought I died… I healed you. Naruto! But… Yeah… I know. What happened to Madara? Did you take him down? No, things ended up
a little differently. I'll explain it simply. Might as well tell you guys
about The Sage of the Six Paths and Kaguya too, and that seal! I don't know what happened, but I assume you didn't defeat
the enemy yet? Take me to where the fight is. You can tell me on the way. I can't sense Sasuke… And my real body feels tingly. It might be real dangerous
over there! I don't know if we'll be helpful
or in the way. But I don't want
to fail because we weren't there
when we were needed. Besides, if we don't bring down
this Kaguya, our world is done for. The few of us who are left have
to do whatever we can… We had our minds made up
from the very start, right? That we're all ready to die. Nothing seems to work… It's hard to believe. So both your powers and
Sasuke's are necessary in order to seal away this Kaguya? Yeah! But like I said earlier,
I can't sense Sasuke at all! The ice…is moving. Over there! She's merged with Nature! Naruto! She's finally showing herself. What's happening? That's a form of Time-Space. Damn it! It's no good! Okay… I've made it look
like I'm restrained… I'll just wait until she gets closer! You said you suddenly
stopped sensing Sasuke? Yeah. I suspect he was taken
to another dimension. She emerged from
a different Time-Space. It's similar to
my own Visual Prowess. Can you enter it? If I resonate my Kamui the next time she connects and opens
a portal to another Time-Space, I'm positive I can enter it. If Sasuke is there, I can bring him back
to this dimension. All right! Then I'll go and support
the real me. However… I'll need an enormous amount
of chakra to do it… since it's not
my own Time-Space. If my chakra runs out
while I'm there, I'm done. Then I'll go with you. The real me won't go down
that quickly. Because I'm strong. Your Clone Chakra isn't enough. Would it still be inadequate with
my 100 Healings Chakra? That would give me
the bare minimum. Both of you, come with me. All right! We don't even know if
Sasuke is in that Time-Space. But we'll start by getting
into close range with her. I promise to find Sasuke,
and deliver him to the real you. Obito. Thanks for rescuing me… And Sasuke too. Don't thank someone like me. Just keep an eye on the enemy. So no more masks, huh? I'm…Kakashi's friend,
your father's subordinate, I'm an Uchiha just like Sasuke… and… The Hokage is someone
who endures pain and takes the lead
in front of everyone… There is no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage! There are no ways out for the one
who becomes the Hokage! The way he forges ahead
draws others towards him. He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble. I… I am your senior who dreamt
the same dream as you. I'm not going to waste time
on a speech, because I'm almost out of time. But…I just ask that you
let me walk in front of you… and die for you. I'm sorry I'm late. Have you learned anything yet? There's no one here. Just the lower half of Madara's body. Does finding Madara's lower half mean that we should
consider him dead? I have a bad feeling about this… Either way, it seems he completed
his Infinite Tsukuyomi. And apparently,
it doesn't affect us dead… How did things go on your end,
Fourth Hokage? I cut part of the tree to try to free the people
entrapped in the jutsu, but they didn't awaken. Instead, another branch immediately
wrapped itself around them. So it was the same for you. In order to verify Madara's status,
and find out what happened, we should use his lower half
to revive him with the Reanimation Jutsu. Then we'll make him talk. To do that, we'd need
a living sacrifice! How can you be
so naïve at this point? There has to be another way! You truly are a kind soul, previous reincarnate of Ashura. Wh-Who are you? My name is Hagoromo. As the founder of Ninshu,
the Ninja Creed… I am also known as
The Sage of the Six Paths. You're The Sage of the Six Paths? In order to save
Naruto and Sasuke,

 who are battling my mother
Kaguya right now…

 you must know everything
that has occurred.

 Before I talk about Ashura and Indra,

 I must first explain the origin
of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ninja Creed"


 It was some thousands
of years ago…


 NINJA CREED


 Tune in again!
  

 My name is Hagoromo… As the founder of Ninshu,
the Ninja Creed… I am also known as
The Sage of the Six Paths. You're The Sage of
the Six Paths? Indeed I am. Right now, Naruto and
Sasuke have taken on Ashura and Indra's souls and
are battling my mother Kaguya… Ashura? You just called me
the "previous reincarnate"? Yes… Ashura and Indra are my two sons. And Kaguya, the one who's
fighting right now, is my mother. What?! So Ashura and Indra's souls
are connected to you too. Their souls have transmigrated
over and over again. The soul of Ashura was
previously inside you, and Indra's soul was inside Madara. Inside of me?! Mother took advantage
of their souls, and after an extraordinary
length of time, she was resurrected. Right now, I know everything, even the intentions of
the one called Zetsu, my mother's third son
who possessed Madara. In order to save
Naruto and Sasuke, you, too, must know everything
that has occurred. Before I talk about
Ashura and Indra, I must first explain the origin
of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed. It was a few thousand years ago… My younger brother Hamura and I, sealed our mother Kaguya and
the Ten Tails in the moon. Hamura went to the moon as well,
so he could watch over Mother. Ninshu: The Ninja Creed


 Thank you for your help, Gamamaru. Without the Sage Power
that you taught me, we couldn't have defeated Mother. You insist on leaving, sibling? Yes. There is something I must do. What are you going to do? My journey will have two purposes. The first… To find a dwelling place for each
of the nine Tailed Beasts that I extracted from
the Ten Tails. I want to make sure
they don't fight amongst each other… and that people don't use
their powers for evil. I intend to choose
their homes very carefully. The second purpose is to
restore this ravaged land. In our battles against Mother, we caused terrible damage
to the land. I must atone for this crime. I see. Yes, that might be good to do. But the road ahead will be difficult. I am aware of that. You know,
I had a dream last night. A dream? Toads rarely dream. When they do dream,
it always comes true. Because a toad's dream
is destiny. What did you dream? Far into the future,
a blue-eyed youth will appear, who will amuse himself with
the names of the nine beasts. I dreamed that
he will call forth a miracle. Does that mean there will be
another age of discord? I do not know. Will everything I do from now on,
be meaningless? Don't worry. Fate is something
you cannot escape. Go on your way. And if fate wills it,
our paths shall cross again, sibling. Farewell. I guess this is my first test. Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? I'm going to fix the bridge. What? Why do something uncalled for? How is it "uncalled for"? The bridge is essential
to everyone. Everyone needs it. That's why it's a problem
for me if it's there. Oh… An interesting comment. Listen, because the bridge
is broken, everyone stops right here. That's where I come in. I go over to the guy
and take his belongings and offer to help him cross. Then, without a moment's hesitation, I make my getaway
with his stuff. I may not look fast,
but these legs never fail me. This is what I do for a living. I see. So you're a thief that uses
this broken bridge to make a living. That's right.
So just leave well enough alone. But it only benefits you. It's a hardship for everyone else. Hey! I said leave it alone.
Do you understand me? Why are you going through
all that trouble? This is to atone for my sins. So are you a criminal? Something like that. Oh man, I guess can't
cross the bridge. Mister, you seem to be in a bind. Leave it to me, I'll take you to
the other side of the river. - Oh!
- I wouldn't, if I were you. That man's a thief. What?! Don't take me for a fool! Hey, you! Quit messing with my business! I'm not moving until
I fix this bridge. You should go find
another bridge. Don't be stupid! Thieves like me have
our own territory… I can't just go somewhere else. Well then,
why don't you help me? I'll leave once the bridge
is finished. Quit messing around! I see. Then there's nothing more to say. You can wait until
the bridge is fixed. Damn it! Fine, I'll just get in his way… That bastard… Just where does that
brute strength come from? Damn it! Hey! Get it together! We've got to work fast or the logs
you went to great lengths to gather will just get washed away. Oh… You're going to help me? I just want you to go away
as soon as possible. And once the bridge is done,
I'm gonna destroy it. My name is Hagoromo. And I'm Futami. Nice to meet you, Futami. Ouch! What are you doing? Can't you tell? I'm building a bridge! You're a thief, right? Doing that won't make all
the bad stuff you did go away! Shut up! Get lost, brat! Now, you're just like me. I'm not like you. I'm not doing this
for atonement. I'm telling you… When it's done,
I'm gonna destroy it. All that work and we're only
one-third of the way done… Breaking it apart is easy, but building it back up
is backbreaking work. Something this sturdy
won't be easy to break. That's true.
If we make it too sturdy… you'll break your bones for sure
when you try to destroy it. Hey you! Don't touch those logs! We're using 'em to fix the bridge! We'll help you. Huh? Since we're going to be
the ones using the bridge. You gotta be careful. Just grab a smaller one. Okay! It's finished!
We did it! We did it! The bridge is finished! This is awesome! It's done, eh? A bridge worth the effort to destroy. Are you kidding me?! After all the work we put into it,
there's no way I'd destroy it. You did a good thing. And it's time for me to move on
to a new place. Take care of yourself, Futami. Hey, wait up! I'm coming with you! Oh? I thought that bridge
was where you lived. With an awesome bridge
like that, my business is shot to hell! When you do a good deed, people are grateful and
it's a good feeling. And because it feels good,
you do more good deeds. That's the cycle of goodness. When you put it that way…
you're right. You have a way with words. By the way,
I didn't ask you before, but… Who are you anyway? I once wreaked havoc
upon this world. Several years ago,
there were many occurrences of giant tsunami and
volcanic eruptions here and there. Don't tell me you caused them? Come on, there's no way
one person could've done that! Besides, if you were that strong, you could've fixed that
bridge in an instant, instead of working and
sweating so hard. I decided never to use
excessive power again. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to understand how people feel. Put your hand out. What is this? I feel power surging into me. I just passed my power to you. Power? Yes… Or maybe I should say chakra. It is, so to speak, the power to
connect people to each other. That's the kind of power
I want it to be. And you passed it on to me? Yes. But it's not something
I can give to just anyone. I've come to feel
very close to you. You have learned
what a good heart is. What are you doing? Please, make me your apprentice! My apprentice? Yeah! I feel something very special
in you… I've lived a meaningless life. My entire life's been worthless! But you're different. You're someone who
can do great things! So…if I stay with you, maybe my insignificant life will
start to show a little value. So you want to be helpful
to others now? When we finished that bridge… All those happy people
and their smiles… I've never been prouder
in my whole life. I'll never forget the look
on their faces! I'm positive that that's the bond
that you spoke of… I mean, Master Hagoromo. You just taught me something
very important. I think my journey has found
another important purpose. A third purpose. People bonding through chakra. Mister, hey Mister! You in a bind because
the bridge is broken? I can help you cross
to the other side… Hey, you! What are you doing here?! This is my turf! We're going to rebuild this bridge! Huh? What the hell are you saying? Listen up! From today, you're gonna
become a good person! Did you hit your head
or something? In time, albeit slowly… I found people who understood
my way of thinking. And some among them joined me
on my journey to help people. From around this time,
I made them my apprentices… and passed on my chakra. I named this bond
"Ninshu, the Ninja Creed." I trained with my apprentices… and continued to ponder… What is life? What is love? What is power? We believed that someday, this bond
with people through chakra NINSHU

would lead to world peace. We continued our travels
for a long time. Restoring places that were
nearly destroyed for no reason… And when we found a place
in those areas where we could release
the Tailed Beasts, we built a shrine for the purpose
of guarding them. Many of my pupils scattered
to different regions to repair the land in my place. And in this manner, Ninshu, the Ninja Creed, spread to
each corner of the world. And later, on my deathbed, I sent the Tailed Beasts that had been
inside me to their respective lands. Praying that they would be able
to spend their days in peace… I will not live much longer… Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu,
Son Goku, Kokuo, Saiken, Chomei, Gyuki, and Kurama… Even if you are far apart,
you will always be together. And eventually, there will come a time
when you will be united again. Each of you with a unique name… and a different form
than before. And unlike when
you were inside of me, you will be guided down
the right path. I hope you learn
what true strength is… before that time… But as you know,
contrary to my hopes… Throughout this long history,
men appeared one after another, with the desire to use
Tailed Beasts for evil purposes… which turned the Tailed Beasts
against mankind. Anyway, back to my story. We continued our long journey. When at last,
I fulfilled my three goals, I returned to my village and made it the headquarters
of Ninshu. I married and fathered two sons. They were Indra and Ashura. Their mother had a difficult recovery
after giving birth to Ashura… and she passed away
shortly after. But my two sons grew up
strong and healthy. They were close siblings. The older one was especially caring and the younger one was always
chasing after his brother. But at the time, I didn't realize that a dark force
was already at work trying to manipulate my sons… At the time,

 my Ninshu did not have
a practical application for fighting yet.

 My original intent for it was
to help bring souls together.

 But due to Indra's innovations,

 the course of Ninshu
was drastically changed.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ashura and Indra"


 He was one who was worthy
of being called the "Genius of Ninshu."


 ASHURA AND INDRA


 Tune in again!


 Ashura and Indra

 Elder Brother! How can you
read all that stuff?! And Father too… Why does he write so much? It all has to do with Ninshu. Every word means something. I know that, but… That's not it… Like this, maybe? The two studied together,
and played together. This one's huge! Ashura! The net!
Get me the net! Be careful. Go slow and steady! Gotcha! Ashura! Look! I got it, Elder Brother! Damn it. You're so impulsive. You got a bite too! You're right! It might be bigger than yours! Oh, it's just driftwood. Whoa! Amazing! It's a huge fish! Nice one, Ashura! Yeah! But Elder Brother, what did you just do? At the time, Ninshu did not have a practical
application for fighting yet. My original intent for it was
to help bring souls together. Healthy bodies to sustain
wholesome spirits… I didn't feel any need… for any martial arts
that went beyond that. But due to Indra's innovations, the course of Ninshu
was drastically changed. - Wow!
- Wow! W-What did you just do, Elder Brother?! When infusing chakra to release power, I noticed that the formation of
your hands make a difference. I think you can use various powers by the way you shape
and combine your fingers. Really? So I'm calling the formation
of your hands "sign" and the manifestation
of the power "jutsu." Sign and jutsu… That's amazing, Elder Brother! I inherited powers from
my mother, Kaguya. So I don't have to weave
signs to invoke jutsu. But this was not the case
for my pupils with whom
I shared my chakra. When Indra was
merely ten years old, he was inventing jutsu
that even I could not do. He was one who was worthy of being called
the "Genius of Ninshu." The invention of jutsu using signs changed the foundation
of people's lives. It became such that anyone
who trained hard would be able to use jutsu. But I was a foolish father. I did not notice that
the powers of darkness that were targeting Indra
were already on the move… Ashura! Are you okay? Ouch… I'm okay, Elder Brother. When releasing chakra,
you must be extremely careful. Or you can be seriously hurt. We possess more chakra
than other people. Sorry. Your invention has transformed
Ninshu greatly. Yes… But I don't know if
that was a good thing. Why is that? Training used to be more spiritual. Now it's become focused
on honing the jutsu itself. In time, it could be used
as a weapon and create chaos in the world. Your astuteness is
almost frightening, my son. I didn't realize you had thought
so deeply about it. Yes… But what will be will be. No one can stop the flow of time. Had you not invented signs,
someone else would have. If chakra is to become a weapon, then we must train the soul
even harder to control that chakra. Yes… So it was you… You inherited Mother's powers! Who's there?! Come out! I'll always be watching you. Very impressive, Master Indra! Next up, Master Ashura! Right! Stop there! Are you okay, Ashura? Yeah. You're really strong, Elder Brother. Training's over! I'm going to play with Taizo
and the others! Good grief… Father, I'm going to go train
a little more on the hill in the back. It seems Master Indra has
assumed great command of the powers
you passed on to him. And that's a good thing. Why is that? Well, if you're to name
a successor one day, it's customary to select
the first son. Having a younger son inherit
could sow the seeds of discontent. No one would object
to Master Indra, him being the one
naturally gifted with Ninshu. The future of Ninshu
is now secure. Hey! You're late, Ashura! Sorry, sorry! I'll have you know that I came
as soon as I finished with training. Anyway, what's up? Look at this! What is this? Wild boar tracks. A lot of the fields have
been damaged recently. That's not good. Why don't we go
and hunt it down? But isn't that dangerous? We should be fine! If worse comes to worst,
we've got Ashura. You can use your Ninshu
to bring it down! What?! - That's right!
- So let's go! Are you there?! I'm so happy that
you sensed my presence! It's a child… What do you want? Why do you keep following me? You will grow strong. You have the desire, potential,
and talent for Ninshu. However… You're still not aware
of your true power. My "true power"? An even greater power
lies dormant inside you. But there is one condition
for awakening that power. Who are you? How do you know that? It doesn't matter. If you awaken your power, my wish will come true one day… Well, never mind about that. We were talking about awakening
your power, weren't we? Do you want to know how? It has nothing to do
with training, you know. You must lose love… What do you mean? Like having a person you love, die. Let's test it out! What are you going to do? Wait! Ashura! Over here! The tracks continue over here! Hey… Don't tell me… - There it is!
- Run! It's coming this way! All right! I'll use that… What's with him anyway?! That's no ordinary boar. Ashura! Use Ninshu! Um…um… Watch out, Ashura! Run away! Shiro! Ashura! Elder Brother… Hurry, go! How dare you do this
to my younger brother! Elder Brother! Are you all right? Yeah… But Shiro's… Shiro gave his life to protect you. Give him a proper burial. Okay… Brother, your eyes! This is… Elder Brother? I know you're there! What did you do?! Oh nothing. That's your true power. From now on, you'll use
those eyes to see the truth. See you later! He's gone! Amazing! Ouch! Put everything you've got into it! Y-Yes! Ashura, you too! You can't expect to use
Ninshu like that! Okay… Sorry. Ever since he awakened
his Sharingan, Master Indra's progress
has been phenomenal. He's disciplined and he has
the right temperament to guide others. He can take over Ninshu anytime. Master Indra is simply amazing. When he glares at you with
those eyes, I can't even move. He's so young,
and he's already an instructor. Master Indra's the one who
invented hand signs and jutsu. But recently he's been too strict. Even earlier, he didn't go easy at all. If Master Indra becomes
the successor, I don't know if I'd be
able to follow him. You're right. Sometimes the way Master Indra
looks at us seems almost hateful. Master Ashura is much easier
to approach, but he's not skilled at all. Nothing ever goes perfectly, doesn't it? I'll say. Elder Brother! Are you going to train
in the mountains again? Yes, that's my intent. Can I come with you? I'm sorry… I want to train alone. With you, I… Yeah, you're right. We're too far apart in skill. E-Elder Brother! Hmm? I… I think you should ease up on the others a bit
during practice… When you're serious,
they end up getting hurt. You have a point.
I'll think about it. Come out, I know you're here. Impressive… It's been a while, hasn't it? I'm not like before. So it seems. Have you gotten used to those eyes? Don't glare at me like that. I wish you'd show me
some gratitude at least. Why should I be grateful to you? Well… I'm the one who awakened
those eyes. By the way… Did you see something
with those eyes? Like the future of Ninshu?
Or your dreams? You've already sensed it, right? That you're special. That you have the power to
change the future of Ninshu. You have overwhelming power. You've inherited most
of Hagoromo's power. Ashura can't hold a candle to you. In time, your power will rival
that of your father, Hagoromo. No one will be able
to compete with you… Next! What's the matter?! Isn't anyone willing to face me? Such cowards. Elder Brother! Why?! You said you'd think it over! Ashura… You don't have the Sharingan,
so you won't understand. Power is what rules the world. Power maintains order. In time, I will take over Ninshu
and fulfill my dream. Elder Brother… Hey, did you hear?

 It seems Master Hagoromo
is close to choosing

 a successor for Ninshu!

 It's between Masters Indra
and Ashura, eh?

 I wonder who it's going to be?

 It's plain as day!

 It's the eldest, Master Indra,

 who's got the outstanding natural gift
for Ninshu!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Tumultuous Journey"


 From here on, I will decide
the successor for Ninshu.


 THE TUMULTUOUS JOURNEY


 Tune in again!


 The Tumultuous Journey

 
 Elder Brother has changed… If he's just strict all the time, I feel like he's going to
alienate everyone. Oh, there you are! I was looking for you, Ashura! Taizo! Are you done with training today? Well, since Elder Brother's
going to take over Ninshu, it doesn't matter if I slack off a bit… Hmm… I see. Well, it's less pressure on me! So, what's up? Oh, oh… I need a favor. Can you use Ninshu to knock down
a few trees around here? Huh? Why? Ah…well... If we clear a path through here,
we'll have a shortcut to the fields. It will be easier on my mom… …and it's no big deal for you, right? Is that all? Leave it to me! Will this do? Yeah, you've been a big help. This kind of thing is easy. Taizo! Elder Brother!
What is the meaning of this? This man has committed a crime. He took down the trees, treating them
as if they were his property. What's in this village
belongs to everyone. That is the law. You are just as guilty, Ashura. Huh? Me too? You were gullible. This man deceived you and made you
an accomplice to his crime. Was clearing a path, a lie? My mom was sick and
needed medicine quickly. I'm sorry I got you involved, Ashura. Why didn't you tell me the truth? I could've used Ninshu if she was sick… Mom hates Ninshu. She says this world
doesn't need Ninshu… Whether you believe in Ninshu or not,
a law is a law. Ashura… You didn't know anything about this. So just this once, you will be forgiven. Indra, perhaps you are taking this too far. Everyone makes mistakes. Judging people requires prudence. I know that, Father. However, when a crime is committed,
proper punishment must be carried out. Only then, will it act as a deterrent
against future crimes. Elder Brother… Ashura! I'll let you out in a moment. But—! It's okay. I'll take full responsibility for this. Elder Brother! Ashura, what do you think
you're doing with that man? Please overlook this, Elder Brother! He didn't do this
with malicious intent. The law is the law. Haven't you already made
an example of him? That's not for you to decide. I'll convince my brother somehow. Go now. Thanks, Ashura! If you're going to break the law, you can take the punishment instead. Stop, Elder Brother! Ashura, why do we have laws? What is the purpose
of Ninshu's power? If you can't answer
these questions yourself, then you should obey me. Calm yourself! Elder Brother… SHIRO
 Father! Today's the day Shiro died. Back then, if Shiro and Elder Brother
weren't there, I would have died. SHIRO

I'm alive, thanks to everyone's strength. You possess a gentle heart… The complete opposite of Indra. Well, Elder Brother is extraordinary. He can do anything by himself,
and he has the power to do so. That is precisely why. What do you think of Indra's eyes? What do I think? Well, I do feel a bit intimidated
by them… As I thought… Indra's Visual Prowess
would not work with Ashura… Is something the matter? There's something ominous about
Indra's eyes that even I cannot fathom. Looking into his eyes
makes me remember… my mother's eyes. Perhaps Elder Brother can see things
that others cannot see? Such as? Something very advanced. Like the ideal version of Ninshu,
or the future… I don't know since I don't have
the Sharingan. But back then,
when he and Shiro saved me, Elder Brother was very kind. I have faith that Elder Brother's heart
has not changed from those days. I'll train harder and do my best to become someone that
Elder Brother can rely on. At that moment,
I felt I understood for the first time, why heaven had blessed me
with two sons. That was… Hey, did you hear? Lord Hagoromo is finally
going to name his successor. Master Indra or Master Ashura.
Which will it be? There's no doubt, it's got to be
the elder one, Master Indra… He excels in Ninshu! And now, I am going to pick
my successor to Ninshu. Father, what is this? During the battle where
I sealed away my mother, parts of the Ten Tails were
scattered throughout the world. We repaired most of the lands
during our journeys. But in that scroll, it is written
that there are two regions, which still need to be fixed. Indra, Ashura… You will each go to these lands and settle whatever problem
has occurred there. And after I see your results, I will decide to whom I will
entrust Ninshu. L-Lord Hagoromo… Why, Father?! Why are you doing this? I don't have the skill to inherit Ninshu… In fact, I have no desire
to inherit Ninshu. I'm more than happy
just helping Elder Brother. That is for me to decide. What will the two of you do
when you are out in the world? When I see what comes out of that,
everything will fall into place. Why did Father decide to do this? Don't worry. Father will come to understand quickly. Uh-huh… The younger one seems to have
matured into a kind and gentle soul. But the older one inherited the power
of the Sharingan, huh… But out of consideration
for his older brother, the younger one might
not return home. I will deal with that
when the time comes. What is it that you want to test? It's not a test or anything. The eldest excels, but due to his power,
he does not have faith in love. The younger one doesn't have the skill,
but overflows with love. Ninshu will come to exert
enormous influence in this world. In order for Ninshu to take
the true and proper path… both power and love are necessary. I want my sons to grow
during their journeys… and learn to nurture Ninshu together. Enough already! Just come out. You knew I was there? Are you all right? Yeah, as you can see! Thanks for what you did back then. Don't mention it. So, what's up? After you helped me, I hid out
in a shack on the hill in the back. Then Gasuka and Edashi… Big news!
Ashura is leaving on a journey! And that journey will determine who
the successor of Ninshu will be. After I heard that, I couldn't sit still. Take me with you! But your mom's sick, isn't she? She's okay now. Seems the medicine really worked. She's back to her lively self. So I told her about you, and she said I should go
and help you. But doesn't your mom hate Ninshu? So why—? That and this are two different things. A man's obligation
comes before hating Ninshu. But…I won't be coming home
for a while. What? Really? I'm sure Elder Brother will
pass this test with flying colors. And if I don't return, Father will choose
Elder Brother as his successor. I see… That's so like you. So then, where do you intend to go? What should I do? Didn't your dad say there are people struggling
where you're supposed to go? Wouldn't it be bad if you
didn't go to help them out? Yeah, that's right. I guess I should just go,
then figure things out later. Yeah! Let's do that! Still… It's awfully far away! According to the map,
we should be getting close. We're in trouble!
We're out of water. Don't worry. How can I not? You can't do Water Jutsu, can you? No. I can only do Wind Jutsu. Well then… It's near…
The Divine Tree. Huh? I can sense it with my chakra. Father once told me… Ninshu Chakra got its power
from the Divine Tree. Hey! Looks like we made it. This is a surprise! To find a place so fertile right in
the middle of such a barren area. How could a village
like this be struggling like Lord Hagoromo mentioned? What's up? We're surrounded! What? Who are you?! We're not suspicious characters… We're just travelers. We've had a lot of robbers lately
who've been targeting our village. We are not robbers.
Please believe us. Never mind. Get 'em! Taizo, get to the top of the tree! Stop this! I have no intention of fighting! Then leave this village now! Hey, are you all right?! Don't touch me! It's okay! I'll heal you. I just hope it works. That's amazing! What's all this ruckus about? Lord Elder… What a feast! We can really eat all of this? Please don't hesitate, eat. I apologize for
the rudeness earlier. Don't worry about it. I must say it's a shock to see such
a fertile patch in this barren land. This village is special. Special? Anyways, there's nothing much
to do here… But please have a relaxing stay. You're up early, Ashura. This is a wonderful place. The food and water taste great, and as luck would have it,
the girl you saved is quite a beauty. There are no issues here. Yes. But I still feel it…
coming from over there. Feel what? Chakra… And the Divine Tree is there? Probably. Hey, where are you going? I'd like to go to that hill. You can't. The Lord Elder says
no one is to go near there. Oh, really? Please leave! Let's go, Ashura. Yeah. Something's suspicious. Maybe there is something, after all. Oh! You're the beauty from yesterday. Perfect timing. We're planning on
staying a bit in this village… So I'm hoping you can
show us around. This is Ashura and I'm Tai—! I'm Kanna. Are you a doctor? I'm not really a doctor… He knows Ninshu. Ninshu? Oh, I see. So that's what it was… Can you heal illnesses with that too? Illness? Come with me. Where are we? A medical clinic. I want you to cure my mom's illness. Mom… She's been unconscious
for a long time. What is this? I sense a strong chakra. Could this be from the Divine Tree? It's no good. I can't cure this sickness
with my power. I'm sorry. I see… Are they all like your mother? Yes. Ashura, come here. These are graves, right? No wonder this place
felt so creepy. This illness caused all these deaths? That's right. I have no choice,
I have to go. You're—! I'm sorry, but I'm going to
need you go to sleep. What are you doing? Umm… What were the Visual Prowess
signs again? This way is much faster. There's a cave here. Let's check it out! What is this place? I didn't image it would
be like this inside! I've heard legends about
the Divine Tree, but… This is—! There's no doubt… This is the Divine Tree. That tree is the ruin of the specter
that almost destroyed our world.

 I've been ordered to
do something about it.

 The power of the Divine Tree is
indeed making this land abundant,

 but it's also affecting
the villagers adversely.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Ashura's Decision"


 At any rate, I have to—!


 ASHURA'S DECISION


 Tune in again!


 My chakra is reacting strongly. What's that? It's what was growing on
the sick people. I see! The sap from the Divine Tree's
seeped into the soil. The sap acts like a fertilizer, making this area a lush oasis in
the middle of such a barren region. The power of the Divine Tree
is making the land fertile? So…is the Divine Tree
getting its power back? No, it hasn't completely revived… But it probably will eventually. But the real problem is… Is what? The people are becoming
contaminated first. Contaminated?! The people and animals eat
the produce grown on this land, which accumulates
the sap of the Divine Tree. So does that mean… If you eat the food here,
you're gonna get sick? Probably. But I ate so much yesterday! It's all right. My jutsu can
take care of a small amount… But if you keep ingesting and
accumulating it for many years… Since the Village Elder ordered
for this place to be under watch, does that means
he knows everything? So it seems. Ashura's Decision

 I see…
You saw the Divine Tree. Yes. Traveler, why do you keep digging
for our village secrets? Forgive me. I'm from the Village of Ninshu
and was told to come here. Ninshu? The Ninshu that destroyed
the land 20 years ago… You are a pupil? Yes. That tree is the ruin of the specter
that almost destroyed our world. That is why it's so powerful. I've been ordered to do
something about it. Lord Elder, to be blunt,
that tree is a narcotic. The power of the Divine Tree is
indeed making this land abundant, but it's also affecting
the villagers adversely. At this rate… Traveler,
I am already aware of that. But I cannot authorize
that tree's destruction. Why is that? That tree started to grow powerfully
several decades ago. Until then,
this was arid and barren land. We had terrible droughts
nearly every year. I've lost count of how many
died of starvation. Why don't you try digging a well? It was futile… "Was"? We tried ages ago. One could dig for years, only to hit the solid bedrock
that runs across this land. If we cut down that tree now,
what will happen to us? I cannot tell the villagers that we will be returning to
those days of hunger and suffering. Besides, even if I told them the truth,
the villagers will not believe me. Traveler, do not get involved
any further… It would be best if you leave
as soon as possible. Kanna, how do you feel? About what? In time, you will become infected
by the Divine Tree. And?
We have no other choice! There's nowhere else for us to go! We just have to endure
and live with it. Please listen, everyone! Do you know the truth
behind the Divine Tree? Hey, Ashura! The Divine Tree is
the ruins of a specter. The Divine Tree is the cause of the illness afflicting
the people at the clinic. If you continue to rely on
the power of the Divine Tree, you will all fall victim
to the same illness! Are you okay with that?! Everyone! Don't listen to this guy! These two came from
the Village of Ninshu! They ravaged the world, and now, they want to take
the Divine Tree from us! We can't let them do that! Get out of here! What do you think would happen to us
if the Divine Tree was gone?! Get lost! Ashura, let's get out of here! I hope Masters Indra and Ashura
are all right. Brother, what kind of places
did you send those two? Simply put, villages burdened
with the same problem. I want to know how they resolve it. I see… Be honest, have you already decided
which one will succeed you? No, I haven't decided. Indra's abilities
are extraordinary, but he is too quick to try to
resolve everything by himself. Ashura is truly kind towards people,
but hesitates to take the lead. If this trip helps them mature
and learn to support each other, I would have no complaints. Gamamaru,
have you had a new dream? About their futures? If I did have a dream,
would you want me to tell you? That would be cheating. You must name your successor
by yourself. Well then, I guess I'll be leaving. Gamamaru, I hope you're
not planning on visiting them… Don't interfere. I won't! I doubt you all will ever
be able to reach a decision. Come on Ashura, let's go. Let's just go and have
a carefree journey. Uh-huh… If you're that concerned, just sneak
over there and destroy the tree. You have the power to do that,
don't you? But then, the villagers will… They'll suffer sure,
but they're going to die eventually. Oh yeah… Father didn't say to destroy
the Divine Tree. Huh? Indra… Ashura… You will each go to these lands and settle whatever problem
has occurred there. Father said to resolve the problem. Hey, hey… I hope you're
not getting any weird ideas. To resolve the problem… There's no other way
but to dig a well. Are you serious?
You heard the old man. There's solid bedrock and
you can't dig a well. Yes… But that time, Father said… The power of Ninshu,
which you have inherited… There is no handbook for its use.
Only you can decide how to use it. It's up to us… I've decided. I'm going to do
what I believe is right! Huh? Even if it takes me years! It's Master Indra! Master Indra has returned! Leave it to Master Indra!
He's back already? I'm glad to see you well. Where is Ashura? He's not back yet. I see… Is that—?
Don't tell me he's—?! Ashura! Oh, Kanna! What are you doing?! Can't you tell? I'm digging a well. Are you serious? Yes. If you have water, you won't have to
rely on the Divine Tree. That's impossible. The villagers have tried
digging for years. And they've never found water. I already told him that. But once he gets an idea,
he just won't listen. It doesn't matter whether
it's possible or not. I've decided to do it. See you, Kanna. Are you two…stupid? I might be…
But he definitely is. Even if it takes years,
I'll make it happen. I've returned. Welcome back.
How did it go? I did exactly as I was told. Were there any problems? No.
Peace has returned to the village. Lord Hagoromo… Master Indra has returned first. Which means the successor
of Ninshu is… No, I'm not interested in
how fast things were resolved. I will wait for Ashura to return. Then I will decide. Is that all right, Indra? Yes. It's been awhile, Indra. Oh?
You're in a bad mood. Didn't you come to see me? I'm aware of everything, you know. You did exactly as Hagoromo wished.
But he's still not satisfied. The future Hagoromo envisions for
Ninshu is not the future you envision… You've improved. No matter what happens,
the two of us will follow you, Indra. I will remember your words. Lord Hagoromo… It's been one year since Master Ashura
set out on his journey. But he still hasn't returned. Your pupils are becoming restless. Perhaps, you should
decide on a successor… I realize that. No one will object to Master Indra. Why do you insist on waiting
for Master Ashura? Don't worry.
Ashura will return soon. Lord Hagoromo! What's going on? Master Indra! Master Ashura has returned! Hey! It's not just Master Ashura!
There are so many with him! I recognize Taizo,
but who are the others? So he's back. You are astute about your own sons. I think this water jar
has seen its day. My, my, it took a long time. The younger one is very clumsy… But his tenacity
is quite something. I told you to mind
your own business. I didn't do anything. I just watched, that's all. But I want to let you in
on something. About the village Indra went to. Welcome back. It's great to be home.
Have you been well? Yes. I'm glad you're well too,
Master Ashura. Please go and see Lord Hagoromo. What? Didn't he decide on
Elder Brother already? Is Father still? He's been waiting all this time
for your return, Master Ashura. I see… Father, I've returned. You've become very dignified,
Ashura. We got tired waiting for you… Forgive me Elder Brother. With the level of my strength, I needed much longer to resolve
the problem in the village. Who are those people? Oh, yes. These are some of the villagers. They all helped me. And are now valuable friends. We heard about this village,
and we wanted to see it, so we accompanied Master Ashura. I see.
Welcome, good of you to come. Ashura, let me hear your story. The village I went to relied on
the Divine Tree's water source. So I decided to dig a well. Ashura! Are you seriously
digging a well? It's what I've decided. What the hell?
Are they back to throw rocks at us? Wait. You guys… We'll help you. We want to do it because
it's for our village. If you can,
could you teach us Ninshu too? Uh-huh! Everyone, please be quiet! What's the matter, Ashura? Can you hear it? That sound… It's water! – What is it?
– What happened? This is—! – Water!
– We hit water! – We did it!
– We did it! You did it, Ashura! We did it! We did it! Mom… Kanna. Mom! We are finally free from the curse. I see… So the Ninshu that you spread
has saved many people. Yes! I will now name
the successor to Ninshu. The one who shall
take over Ninshu shall be… Bonds allow people to share
in each other's joy and sorrow.

 In the beginning, bonds overflow
with love and emotion.

 As long as there are bonds,
Ninshu will not be used for evil.

 But power without bonds will surely
bring calamity to this world.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
The Successor


 From here on out,
I entrust my power to you.


 THE SUCCESSOR


 Tune in again!

 I will now name
the successor to Ninshu. The one who shall take over
Ninshu will be… Ashura! L-Lord Hagoromo! Why?! I have nowhere near the skills for
Ninshu that Elder Brother has! The difference is immeasurable! I've made my decision. Please tell me why you were
dissatisfied with me. I received word that the village
I had left you in charge of is near destruction. What? How?! You didn't forcibly use
the Divine Tree to… Do I look like a fool? Tell me what you did. I did the same thing Ashura did. I gave the people the water
they desired… and dealt with the Divine Tree. The only difference was that… I did it alone. And that drastically affected the result. After you left, the villagers fought over water rights
and ended up destroying themselves. Happiness obtained with
the easy way never lasts long. But Ashura labored alongside
the people to open up a path. Hard-earned happiness
is difficult to destroy. Indra, you have a wonderful power
known as the Sharingan. Ashura has matured,
but still lacks in power. Lend him your power going forward
and support the growth of Ninshu. Elder Brother… The Successor
 
 Why? Why didn't he choose me? Exactly! The one with power rules the world!
That's just common sense! Indra has the power
to decide everything! Let's appeal to
Lord Hagoromo again. We'll support you! Thanks, both of you. No need for thanks.
We just want to support you. Yes, just tell us anything
that you want us to do! Really? This is amazing! I've never seen such a feast! Today is the auspicious day
the successor of Ninshu was chosen! Everyone, eat and enjoy
to your heart's content! Let's eat, everyone! I think we came at a bad time. Don't worry about it. To be honest, I'm relieved. That Ashura was chosen
to be the successor. Ashura's big brother is smart
and he's a genius with Ninshu, but there's a coldness to him. If he was named successor,
I think we'd all be scared of him. I see. But Ashura understands a person's pain. He's a bit dense, but this last journey
really matured him. Enough to make you
fall in love with him and follow him all the way here. W-What're you saying?! You're blushing. You idiot! Ouch! Really… Hey, where is Ashura anyway? Ashura… You're not satisfied? Yes. Indra has changed… It's because of the Sharingan. Sharingan? Everyone who sees Sharingan is
overwhelmed by its power. And that happened
way before Indra realized it. That's how powerful
Indra's Sharingan is. That power stopped Indra from
understanding how others feel… And in the end, it closed his heart. But you are different. You understand the human heart. That is why you enhanced
Ninshu with love. And that nurtured trust among people,
created bonds and friendship. Friendship? A bond is only created after
sharing hardship together. A bond overflows with love
and compassion. As long as there are bonds,
Ninshu will not be used for evil. However, power without bonds will
bring about calamity in the world. Ashura… Join forces with your brother and
spread the bonds of Ninshu. Father… From this moment onward,
I entrust my power to you. Ashura! Where did he go? What is that?! W-What is it? Kanna! Are you all right? Yes… What just happened? Elder Brother! Indra… What is the meaning of this? Why? Why didn't you choose me
as your successor? It isn't power that
controls Ninshu, but love. That is what I have decided. Love?
There is no need for love! During my journey, like Ashura,
I searched for the villagers' pain. But ultimately, the villagers
ended up relying on my power. The weak revered me as their king
and wanted my power. Ashura was lacking. That is why he found it necessary
to get the cooperation of others. But I'm different! I don't need the help of the weak. I can use my power
and I can establish total order! A world completely
devoid of conflict! That's just like my mother, Kaguya… Especially those with power,
must never forget the human heart. People cannot progress
as swiftly as you can. Those who cannot walk
at the same pace can only fear power
that has no bond. People will not support
governance through fear. Then I shall force them to obey. Please stop, Elder Brother! You would have given
your life to protect me. That's how kind you once were! Ashura…
I am no longer that man. I cannot return to being him. Indra… Your eyes! We just want to support you. Yes, just tell us anything
that you want us to do! Really?
Thank you, both of you. Indra… Why?! Forgive me… Whenever I lose the ones
closest and dear to me… my Sharingan evolves. Indra!
So you've stooped that low… Please stop!
I don't want to fight you, Elder Brother! Oh…fight me? You've become quite brave, Ashura! You really think
you can take me on? What?! A-Amazing! That's the result of his training! You've become quite brave, Ashura! But it's not enough to beat me! Here I come. This is power! Ashura?! Father!
Everyone! Everyone!
Join forces! You have the audacity
to point your blade at me? The powerless can band together,
but it means nothing. Father, let me perform the last rites
for your fragile ideals! It's over! Elder Brother! This is… The power of the Six Paths! You inherited it? Ridiculous! Everyone, lend Ashura your power! Father! Ashura, chakra is a power that
can link the hearts of many! Everyone! I feel it…I can feel…
everyone's… …power! What?! What is this? Elder Brother! Ashura! This is… …the power of our bond! Elder Brother! Stay away! Ashura… I will never… acknowledge Ninshu…or you! Elder Brother… Soon after that, I heard rumors that Indra established
a sect of Ninjutsu that idealized power. I recorded the misfortune that
the Sharingan brings about in the stone tablet. However, Zetsu took advantage of it and seems to have
been a total waste. Ashura… It seems my time in this world
is coming to an end. Father! - Father!
- Grandpa! I was not able to guide
this world well… That's not true! We'll pass on your will to many,
many people through Ninshu, Father! But I leave behind some who will not… Indra came by last night. Is that you, Indra? Have you come to kill me? There's no need for me
to do that anymore. I came here to end the future
of this hell disguised as Ninshu. You have always feared
the power of my grandmother. And instead of trying to
understand this enormous power, you merely ran from it… using love and bonds as a shield. Your selfish misconception
will mar the future of Ninshu with wars and calamities. Until I destroy Ashura
and his brethren, and wipe out Ninshu from
the face of this world, I have no intention of
ever stopping my fight. Until I accomplish this, my soul will reincarnate and fight,
however long it takes! Forgive me. Father, please be at peace. If Elder Brother's soul will reincarnate
over and over again, so shall mine. Ashura…
I entrust the future of this world… …to you and your descendants… Father! Lord Hagoromo! - Father!
- Grandpa! And as Indra warned, the battle between them waged on, never-ending,
over and over again. These battles took the lives of many
comrades and kin on both sides. Hate begat hate,
and it reached a point of no return. The fighting continued even after
Ashura and Indra died to the numerous reincarnates
of their souls. To you, Senju Hashirama,
and Madara Uchiha… and now, to Naruto Uzumaki
and Sasuke Uchiha. Everyone… You must do everything in your power
to save Naruto and Sasuke. I have implicit faith that these two will find
the true solution to this fate of the shinobi
that has continued for so long. There's only one S-rank mission
that we can do, ya know?

 Nothing good happened
and we messed up before, 

 but it's a mission
that only we can do!

 This is getting interesting…

 I'm getting kind of excited for this!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"A Special Mission"


 All right!
Let's begin the mission!


 A SPECIAL MISSION


 Tune in again!


 With that being said,
our mission is over. You're dismissed. We're done already?
But it's only ten in the morning! Lately, all of our missions
have been so boring! When are we gonna get
an S-rank mission? "S-rank"? A loser like you? What are you talking about? We're still genin! I want something with
more pizazz…more oomph! Uh, there aren't any. Okay, dismissed! You heard him, Sasuke. So how about today,
just the two of us… I'm going home. Just hold on a minute. There's only one S-rank mission
that we can do. A mission that's
failed numerous times… One that only we can pull off… …to see what Kakashi Sensei's face
really looks like! Let's find out what the best-kept
secret about our target is! A SPECIAL MISSION

 Why are you trying to act like
you know what you're saying?

                               A SPECIAL MISSION

 Just forget about that already. Right, Sasuke? This is the perfect mission
for a day like today. I couldn't agree more! INNER SAKURA

I got tricked! INNER SAKURA

Cha! But what do we do? Every time we try,
it never goes well. I already have a plan! What is it? Photos! If we go through every single photo
Kakashi Sensei is in, there's bound to be at least one… I never told you this,
but I already checked once before. He has a mask on in every one. The photo submitted to the Hokage
for the Ninja Registration Form… …should be one of him
without a mask. But it's an extremely classified,
top-secret document… Accessing it would be no easy task. He overheard us! Who cares if he
overheard us or not?! Who are you? I'm Sukea, a photographer. I travel to the east and west
looking for scoops. What about north and south? Naruto! You've been getting hung up on
insignificant details since earlier! Anyways,
I was searching around for a scoop and happened to overhear
an interesting conversation… He did hear us!
Should we get rid of him?! You idiot! Ouch! He's right. There's a rule that the photo for
the Ninja Registration Form must be of your entire face. It's so obvious, we didn't even
think about looking there. Will you let me join you
in this adventure? What's your motive? If I'm able to capture
this Kakashi guy without a mask, I'll have the biggest scoop since
the Hidden Leaf was established. Even if it's hushed up, I'm sure to
make a lot of money out of this. Hey! Hey! When you get the money, you have to
treat us to ramen! Promise? I'll even throw in some dumplings. So it's settled then? This is getting interesting… Oh, you guys… INNER SAKURA

I'm getting kind of
excited for this! Secret documents are stored here… This is an infiltration mission… Mr. Sukea, will you
be able to keep up? Before I started taking pictures,
I was a rank-and-file ninja… All right! Let's begin the mission! Not done yet, Sasuke?! Shut up… Wait! Can we switch? It opened! Wow! Sukea… What division did you belong to? The Intel Unit that reported
directly to Lord Hokage. That's the… ANBU Black Ops. Things happened
and now I'm retired. Considering your past,
is it wise for you to be doing this? You'll be targeted by the ANBU. Don't worry about it.
C'mon, let's go. We have to search in all of these? Let's hurry. Found it! This is it! Okay, let's open it. The moment is finally here! REGISTRATION FORM
 REGISTRATION FORM
 REGISTRATION FORM
 Don't move! We're taking you in. Make a move and
we'll take that as resistance… Depending on the situation
we may have to take you down. I-I feel like I'm going to sneeze. Idiot! Hold it in! Damn it…we were so close! FIRE
 Really? An infiltration mission? I'm so sorry… I tried to stop them,
but they insisted… Huh?! What a jerk! So you planned on blaming us
from the start if this failed?! They wanted to see
what you really looked like… You're a former ANBU Black Ops,
aren't you? Honestly!
Who cares what I really look like?! You've got some nerve blaming us! I thought it was strange. You're skilled,
and you're a former ANBU. You could've done this alone. I can't stand guys who are handsome,
but do nasty things. Sorry! Sorry! I'll make it up to you by helping you
photograph Kakashi Sensei's face. This time with
my photography skills. What? You're still gonna do this? Why? You're already giving up? What's your plan? Let's go for Kakashi himself. We'll lure him out to a meal,
then photograph him while he eats. We tried many times and failed. Every time, at the very moment
we have a chance to see his face, we get interrupted. With this multi-exposure
camera I built, we should get at least one photo. SWEET CHESTNUTS
 Sensei! I need to talk to you about
something very important, ya know?! What is it? Well, why don't we eat
some dumplings while we talk? I'm ready! All right, I'm gonna
take you up on your offer! Hey, Naruto! Were you guys
out taking a stroll too? Don't bother us! We're doing
something really important! What is it? I'm about to find out. He already ate it?! But this time,
we got you on camera! This is…impossible… You're kidding… Not a single one? I feel like some divine power
is at work here. I guess this means… the mission is over
and dismissed, huh? I guess I'll be… Hey, Naruto! What are you guys up to? Kiba…
And everyone! MAKEOUT PARADISE
 Kakashi Sensei! P-Perfect timing! U-Um…
O-Over there… What's wrong?
Calm down and tell me. A woman's drowned…
O-Over there by the river… What?! This isn't good.
Her pulse is weak. Good job, Sakura! Her medicine's even fooled
Kakashi Sensei! This calls for… He definitely has to
take his mask off now! This woman's in danger!
We can't waste any time! We have to get her to the hospital! Plan A…failed. Understood.
Everyone, switch to Plan B. Mr. Sukea, please get into
position as well. Roger. All right, he's coming! Just as Shikamaru predicted, he's gonna pass this way
to the hospital. Everyone get in position! Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!
Roll! Roll! Roll! What're you doing?!
We have to get her to… Go! Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Sphere! Now! 3…2…1 Now! Scatter! Mind Transmission Jutsu! Look, you guys… I get that you want to see
what I look like, but think of the situation
at hand here! She needs to get to
the hospital ASAP! Shadow Possession Jutsu! Complete! Do it now, Sukea! It finally worked, Naruto. You can have ramen
and dumplings now! Hey guys, the plan worked! Finally… You guys should all be
grateful to us. That's because— Okay, Kakashi Sensei…
Get ready! Do it, Shikamaru! It's time for the unveiling. Wait, wait, you guys. Let's just talk things over. H-Hey!
Stop! Stop! C-Calm down! Keeping this a mystery makes it
more alluring, don't you think? Ramen and dumplings at Ichiraku
sound way more alluring to me. So you were bribed! Checkmate! Hey! Wait!
I mean, please wait! You're being annoying, Lee! Please spar with me! Neji! What?
Don't interfere! Enough is enough, you two! Hey! Wait! Sorry! Ouch! A S-Shadow Clone? What's the hell is going on? Does this mean Kakashi Sensei was
on to us from the very beginning? It was too bad… But I'm really
grateful to all of you. Nah… Thanks to you Sukea,
we had a great time! Thank you! I'd better get going. Let's team up again
if something comes up. Hope you get your scoop! They really seem like
they're having fun! It was sheer coincidence that Kiba
came to the dumpling shop… But who would have thought
everyone would team up. But something like this is good,
once in a while. But it really wears me out… …using this many Clones
and Transformations. It was a close call with my mask…
because of everyone's teamwork. Even if they got the mask,
it's no harm done. Because I'm wearing
a back-up mask underneath. Food is the best way! That has the highest probability… But the problem is, how do we get
Kakashi Sensei to eat with us. Bad timing!
They're coming this way! Hey! Excuse me, but did you notice any kind of
trouble going on around here? Huh? No, there wasn't anything… Kakashi… I heard him and his team were making
a commotion all around town. Sorry for stopping you. N-No problem. Hey. Uh, can I help you? Don't I know you from somewhere? N-No…
I don't think so… Really?
Well, excuse me. Later! I could have sworn
I've met him before… Changing your voice
really puts a strain on the throat. RENTAL AGREEMENT
 It turned out to be
a good mission after all… Their teamwork's gotten
much better than it was during the bell-snatching mission. Oh well… I can probably only keep this up
for about two or three more attempts… I can't use a pervy move
to distract her anymore.

 So I gotta go back to the basics

 …and corner her!

 If she tries to escape through
that weird window again,

 I'll enter it with her.

 That's where I'll look for Sasuke!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Connecting Thoughts"


 I can still sense
Sasuke's chakra clearly!


 CONNECTING THOUGHTS


 Tune in again!

00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,200
What's up with...this picture? This is a strange picture. In this picture book... only the facing pages
in the middle are incomplete... This is...kind of creepy... Naruto! This time for sure...
we'll save Sasuke! Right! You're late. Weren't you supposed
to join me for some new Jutsu training
this afternoon, Orochimaru? Talking rude like that again... Don't get so angry. Instead, I got a little present
for you today... This is a Shinobi from the Leaf,
just like you... You guys should be able
to exchange... nostalgic stories of home, right? Sasuke... Uchiha... <i>Infiltration:
<i>The Den of the Snake!


</i> How do you do?
My name is Sai. So you're Sasuke Uchiha--? Get lost. It seems I'm the type of person
people don't like one way or another... even if I try to make a smile... Just recently, Naruto also expressed
his dislike towards me... But I get the feeling
I'll be able... to get along better with you
compared to Naruto. Sasuke! I'm sweating...? <i>I don't feel anything...
<i>and I have no emotions.</i> <i>Yet just by looking
<i>into Sasuke's eyes...</i> <i>I feared him within the depths of my soul
<i>that even I can't perceive?</i> It's probably not a good idea... to joke around
with Sasuke too much. He's even more troublesome
than I am, you see. I don't care about that guy. Join me right now...
Orochimaru. I've heard a lot about you
from Naruto. It seems he was looking for you
over the last three years... There used to be
a guy like that...wasn't there? Let's go, Orochimaru. Naruto said he thinks of you like... He thinks of you like
a real brother... That's what I heard from Sakura. I only have...one brother...
the man I want to kill. Okay, I'll be going, too. Kabuto... make a Bingo Book
using this. Yes, sir. Then, I leave the rest to you. What's this? A copy of the list
of Anbu Black Ops members... under the direct command
of the Hokage...? It looks like the real thing. This is the place, huh...? The entrance is straight ahead
beneath that rocky area. Could it be that... Sasuke's under there...? There's a good possibility. At the very least, there should
be clues of some kind. All right! Let's go! Just a minute. Go after you swallow this,
Naruto. It's okay!
You don't need to worry. Here. You, too, Sakura. Now even if we get separated, I'll know where you guys are
right away. N-No way! Seriously?! What is this? Stated simply, this seed is
a transmitter used for tracking. It's a Ninja Tool that resonates
only with my Chakra. It's the same thing I placed
in Sai's clothing and food. In Sai's clothing...and food? This seed... I get it. That's how you were able
to track him this far. When did you do that,
Captain Yamato? Do you remember when
I got out of the hot spring first? Come to think of it... <i>I'm getting out now.</i> You certainly did get out first! Now you know why I went to the trouble
of letting you guys enjoy... the hot springs and magnificent food
at my expense, right? It wasn't just
to improve our rapport, huh? And Lady Tsunade told me... to take particular caution
in regards to Sai. <i>An additional member...</i> <i>a new recruit from
<i>the Anbu Black Ops Training Division...</i> <i>will be dispatched
<i>to Team Kakashi...</i> <i>However...</i> <i>What is it?</i> <i>Keep a close watch
<i>on his actions...</i> And she was right. <i>Wow!</i> <i>Man, it sure looks good...</i> I'm glad I took care
of things ahead of time. But never mind that.
Swallow that quickly. Got it! All right!
Let's get going, you two. - Okay!
- Right! Excuse me... Hmm? I would like to say hello to all the others here
in this hideout. That won't be necessary. To be precise,
you can't right now. This is because
the only subordinates here... right now are Sasuke and myself. I can barely feel
the presence of anyone. I think it's safe to assume there
are not that many enemies at all. Even so, make sure
you don't let your guard down! Our opponent is Orochimaru, and we can assume that Sai
has defected to the enemy's side. The formation for infiltration will be
in the following order: me, Sakura, and Naruto. How will we infiltrate? We'll go by the book... and infiltrate from underground
using Earth Style. First, we'll open up
a pit in this area. And then, once we've made
a degree of progress digging... we'll move forward little by little
by digging a tunnel... heading for that rocky area
where the entrance is. Right! Okay, understood. Okay, let's begin. When I give the signal,
come down in order! Okay, here we go! Let's go, Naruto! Right! <i>We finally did it...</i> <i>We found you.</i> Okay, come on inside... This is your room. Sorry about this place being
so dull with nothing in it. The bathroom is in the back. When you don't have
anything to do... stay in here nice and quiet. We'll let you know from our end
if something comes up. Sorry, but I'll be locking the door
from the outside for now. After all, you're...
You know, right? It appears the hideout... is surrounded by rocks,
just as I thought... I'll smash this thing right away!
With my Rasengan! Just a minute! The enemy will notice us immediately
if you use a big Jutsu like that! Infiltration must be done
quietly all the way... But how do we do that...? Here it is! The harder the rock... by applying just a little force
to a small crack... Look, just like this. Wow! Now, please limit your use
of Chakra from here on. Orochimaru will notice that
we're here, after all. Okay, let's go. A successful infiltration,
more or less. First, we need to find Sai. This way. Now then, if I don't get right
to making the Bingo Book... Master Orochimaru
will scold me again. He'll probably tell me people
with A type blood... are better suited to be subordinates
if I do stuff like this. Clear. Let's go. We're almost there... In the Foundation, there were many who came
from broken families... brought about by battle. My older brother was one of those
with whom I became close, like a real brother. I was planning on giving him
this picture book. But ever since that day,
I haven't been able to remember... what picture I was going to draw
for the final facing pages. The picture I wanted to show him
the most. Next time: "Bonds." This time, we're going
with my strategy. Help me out. Mother…
These two are quite annoying. Why don't you split them up… and take them on separately? Sasuke! Now you won't be able
to seal Mother away… First, I'll suck out all of your chakra! Damn it! CONNECTING THOUGHTS


 CONNECTING THOUGHTS


It's hard to believe. So both your powers and Sasuke's are necessary in order
to seal away this Kaguya? Yeah! But like I said earlier,
I can't sense Sasuke at all! The ice…is moving. Over there! She's merged with Nature! Naruto! She's finally showing herself. You said you suddenly stopped
sensing Sasuke? Yeah. Then I suspect he was taken
to another dimension. If I resonate my Kamui
the next time she connects and opens a portal
to another Time-Space, I'm positive I can enter it. If Sasuke is there, I can bring
him back to this dimension. However… I'll need an enormous amount
of chakra to do it, since it's not my own Time-Space. If my chakra runs out
while I'm there, I'm done. Then I'll go with you. The real me won't go down
that quickly. Because I'm strong. Your Clone Chakra isn't enough. Would it still be inadequate
with my 100 Healings Chakra? That would give me
the bare minimum. Both of you, come with me. All right! I'm not going to waste time
on a speech, because I'm almost out of time. But… I just ask that you let me
walk in front of you… and die for you. Then it's true. This man can't be saved. That's why he intends to die… We don't even know if Sasuke
is in that Time-Space. But we'll start by getting
into close range with her. I promise to find Sasuke,
and deliver him to the real you. Obito. Thanks for rescuing me… And Sasuke too. Don't thank someone like me. Just keep an eye on the enemy. So no more masks, huh? I'm Kakashi's friend, your father's subordinate, I'm an Uchiha just
like Sasuke, and… The Hokage is someone
who endures pain and takes the lead in
front of everyone. The way he forges ahead
draws others towards him. He makes you want to reach out
when he's about to stumble. I was your senior who dreamt
the same dream as you. Naruto! And you said
your name was Sakura? Keep a hand on me, so we can teleport to a different
Time-Space at any moment. Got it. She knows about us, after all. We have to keep in mind that even if we jump into
her dimension with Kamui, she'll perceive us. So we're not worth her attention, eh? Yeah, come over here. What you want…
is my chakra, right?! Whatever jutsu I use,
she's just going to absorb it. So what will work best
on her is also… a feint and taijutsu! I can't use a pervy move
to distract her anymore. So I gotta go back to the basics and corner her! If she tries to escape through
that weird window again, I'll enter it with her. That's where I'll look for Sasuke! Even now, I can sense
Sasuke's chakra clearly! This is my Time-Space. You are powerless here. Are you ready, Naruto? Yeah! I'm going to boost your chakra
to the boiling point! Vapor Style: Unrivalled Strength! All right! A-Amazing… I infused chakra for you, Naruto! Thank you, Kurama! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Right now,
this place is my Time-Space! U... zu... ma... ki! Naruto Uzumaki Barrage! It opened! The real me will go! He forced his way in? Impossible! He disappeared? Looks like several managed
to get in. The other two ran out of power
and faded. Seems your clones didn't
have enough chakra. Are you the original Naruto? So what if I am? Mother, he's made it all the way
into this Root Time-Space. It's not good that
he's here in this place that connects directly
to the other five Time-Spaces. He might be able to get
to where Sasuke is, using the resonance of
the dual opposite powers. Take that weird jutsu earlier, this shinobi Naruto has
always been unpredictable. We ought to just… kill him right now! We can't do that. I must absorb
those children's chakra. You use a huge amount of chakra whenever you change
the Time-Space of the world, Mother. You need to preserve the chakra
you've got for an emergency. It's better if you don't keep
engaging him. If you get sealed away,
all will be for naught. No doubt,
you'll lose a lot of chakra. But you don't need his! It's better than having our long-
cherished plans turn to dust. You're right. We can kill him with this! Murderous Bone Ash! Die! Now all of his clones
in the Ice World should be gone as well! Thanks to Naruto, we were able to successfully hide
inside my Time-Space. But he's gone, even as a clone. You're the only one
I can rely on, Sakura. I know! There's a reason
I put myself at the front! And I'll do even more than Naruto! He's the fool who fell
in love with me… I'm the one who made
Naruto suffer the most. I was always wrong,
I always made mistakes. I don't want to be wrong
ever again. I don't want to make
a mistake ever again. That's why…
I'll never retreat! Leave it to me, Sakura! I'm the super elite ninja,
and future Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki! Remember my name! I'm going to become Hokage and surpass everyone
who came before me! Your previously ridiculous dreams
no longer seem silly. I won't let you die! I simply won't let you! You're not going to die,
no matter what! Looks like we succeeded
in getting in, Obito. Now that you've teleported
over there, please don't get crushed
on the other side! We killed the original! So why aren't they gone? The real me will go! Damn it! Are you okay, Naruto? How is this okay?! Never mind. Just be ready
when Kaguya comes back. The Kamui worked. They're onto us! I'll draw their attention, so you two go hide
in the meantime! I've marked this spot, so I can hide in my Time-Space
for the time being. You too, Sakura! The other two ran out
of power and faded. Seems your clones didn't
have enough chakra. Are you the original Naruto? So what if I am?! So they were just
clones back there. You fooled us. You got me. I'm… the original. I've gotta fight smart
and keep them busy so they don't go back over there. This Time-Space should be
connected to the others. We'll open them one by one
and look for Sasuke. Right! I'll give him all the chakra I've got! What an incredibly vast Time-Space… To be able to connect them
in an instant. Just who is this Kaguya?! Isn't that where we were before? I can't sense Sasuke in there! Are you all right? On to the next! Yes! I thought it was around here… What is…that? He's not here either. You should rest a bit. What about chakra? Oh… I still have reserves. Keep enough to get back. If worse comes to worst
and we can't find Sasuke… We'll find him! Next! Be careful about making
a gateway, Mother. Naruto will get closer to Sasuke. Plus, I've figured out something. The original Naruto has
Truthseeker Orbs around him! A sea of acid! Are you okay? I'm fine! This is nothing. You are a Medical Ninja,
aren't you? I'll wait until you heal your wound. That place wasn't
the right one either. After we rest a little, we'll… Don't worry about it! There's a limit to our chakra, right? Why don't you tend to
your wound? Just a little will… I don't want to waste this chance
that Naruto gave us! You want to help him
if he starts to stumble, eh? Huh? It's nothing. Okay, next! Yes! He's here! Sasuke! Sasuke! Over here! Hurry! Damn it! Sasuke! Cha! Sasuke! No way… How did you do it? It's one of my abilities. I can shift myself between spaces, although only over a finite distance. But I made it here,
thanks to that. Am I powerless to do
anything but watch?

 Right about now, Sakura
and Obito are battling…

 I really couldn't do much
for you as your teacher.

 Nor Obito and Rin,
as your friend.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
“The Two of Them…Always”

 I just put on airs…
and kept making mistakes.


 THE TWO OF THEM…ALWAYS


 Tune in again!


 I see… Sasuke and Naruto are in
an alternate Time-Space as well as Sakura and Kakashi. Naruto and Sasuke are
the core participants in the battle. I wish we could have gotten
your advice and aid a bit earlier. This lower body is a part of Madara
after he became the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki. In short, it contains Ten Tails,
Madara and Hashirama… No, rather Nine Tails, Madara
and Hashirama. No, rather Nine Tails,
Indra and Ashura. I'm only able to emerge like this now
because their chakra is finally one. Going back to the jutsu
you mentioned earlier, just what exactly are you doing to do? I will weave the signs for the jutsu. But this jutsu requires
a vast amount of chakra… which I don't have right now
since I've given it away. There's very little time.
I ask you to just do as I say. THE TWO OF THEM…ALWAYS


 This man lent me his power.
That's how we were able to get here. He did? Oh no… Damn it… I can't…
Not until I can bring them back… Hang on! Will I… break my promise again? Rin? You know, Rin, you saving me, is really the same as you
saving the world. Hmm? I mean… It's because I'm gonna become
the Hokage and end this war! For me to do that I have to
stay strong and healthy in this world. So…how do I put it? If you don't stay close
and keep an eye on me… I mean… Well… Y-You got so close all of a sudden! Don't scare me like that! You just said to stay close
and keep an eye on you? Yeah, I did. So watch over me. I'm going to wear the Uchiha crest… and definitely become the Hokage! Okay! Oh man, oh man, oh man!
This is the one day I can't be late! NINJA ACADEMY
ENTRANCE CEREMONY
 - Where do you wanna go?
- I don't know, where should we go? It's the entrance ceremony
and you're already late. Someone like you has no business
being in the Academy. You'll never make it. It's okay. I got this just for you. For me? Yes! Just submit this
and you'll be able to enroll. Thank you! You're a lifesaver! Keep pampering him and
he'll never be cured of his tardiness. Shut up! Do you wanna fight? Begin! Stop right there! That's amazing! What's with that headband? You passed! Congratulations! Thanks. Aren't you going to congratulate me? As if! I'll catch up to you in no time! Just you wait! Obito… Class is starting. Let's go. Rin… Keep… Keep watching over me, okay? Huh? I… I'll catch up to him! Then I'll surpass him and I'll become the Hokage,
no matter what! Don't worry,
I'll always be watching. I found you, Obito! Huh? Rin! Are you all right?! I just slipped.
I'm okay. I'm okay. Here is the graduation certificate
for Obito Uchiha! This certifies that you have graduated
from the Hidden Leaf Ninja Academy. You are commended for persevering
through the rain and wind to reach this milestone! Here! Congratulations on graduating. Rin! Thank you, Rin. No one's here to watch. But this makes me happier than
receiving it from Grandpa Hokage! We've been assigned
to a team and now… this is our first step as shinobi! I still have a long ways to go, but I'm a little bit closer to
becoming the Hokage…right? CHUNIN EXAMS
FIRST STAGE TEST
 I'M ALWAYS WATCHING YOU.
-RIN
 CHUNIN EXAMS
THIRD STAGE
ONE-ON-ONE BATTLES
 I'm going to have you pay me back
in full for the last time. The "last time"? Do your best, Obito! All right… Just watch me! Begin! Wha—?! The winner is Might Guy! What is he doing? So this is where you are. O-Oh, it's you, Rin. It's only natural that Kakashi passed. But we can do it too.
I know we can! Let's practice hard for next year! But it's hard to get pumped up
after watching Kakashi… What are you saying?! You're going to be the Hokage,
aren't you? I'm always watching you! Okay! NINJA ACADEMY
 Obito… I did it! I'm a Chunin now! You're late again! A lot happened on my way here
and I got lost… How come every path you take
is a roundabout route? Just walk a straight line! They're not falling into line at all,
are they? That's for sure.
But you know, Sensei… Let me handle this. I'll watch over the two
of them…always! Let's go… …you guys! I was stubborn and never at ease. But you never failed to
come to my rescue. Since it's a dream,
everything is how you want it! Even the dead can be alive again! A world of only victors… A world of only peace… A world of only love… I will create such a world. Rin… again… I'll create a world where
we can be together again. Thank goodness! You came back! There's still something I must do. We're going back, you two. Hang on to me. All right! There's no mistake. Those things… They cut down
the Shadow Clones earlier. The Clones are desperately
protecting that one. There's no mistake, Mother. The one with the Truthseeker Orbs
behind him is the real one! There's no end to them! Am I powerless to do
anything but watch? Right now, even Sakura and Obito
are desperately… I… I really couldn't do much
for you as your teacher. Nor you, Obito and Rin… as your friend. I just put on airs
because I was an elite, and kept making mistakes. It's not over yet! There's no way I'm gonna lose! What am I doing wallowing,
when Naruto's fighting so hard? That's why I'm never any good. There should be something
I can still do! Obito! Impossible!
It's Sasuke! He's here! Now, there's nothing to worry about. No way! Naruto! Why you! He passed the Truthseeker Orbs
to a clone? We fell for something so simple! Thank you, Sakura and Obito! What? You're okay? You scared us there! Sasuke! Did you thank
Sakura and Obito properly? Focus on the enemy! Well, Naruto was always
unexpectedly cunning. Mother… Since they've reunited,
we have no other choice. We can't afford to be stingy
with our chakra. I know that. My body feels so heavy. This terrain…
is digging into my body! I can't levitate! A heavy gravity plane this time! Except… She's affected too. Oh no! Damn it! The Visual Prowess
in my left eye hasn't… Dodge it, Sasuke! Is the heavy gravity distorting your aim? I've now adjusted for it.
I won't miss with the next one. I won't let you! There's something that I can still do. I can at least be a shield for them! – Let me make it in time!
– Let me make it in time! – Rin!
– Rin! Again, you… Thank you, Rin. Obito and I will be joining you soon. We can catch up then…
together, the three of us. Rin… This time, when I get there… Let's spend some alone time together,
just you and me. Kakashi would just be in the way. I'm gonna leave him here. This is…Kamui! Obito! You! Kakashi… You stay here
a little while longer. Don't you rush to follow us! After fighting you,
I feel like I've woken up.

 When I was a kid, I'd imagine myself
as the Hokage so often.

 I think it's because
you brought back…

 that indescribable feeling of
exhilaration and uncertainty.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"You Better…"


 Don't laugh at Obito!


 YOU BETTER…


 Tune in again!

 - Please make it in time!
- Please make it in time! - Rin!
- Rin! Thank you, Rin. Obito and I will be
joining you shortly. We can catch up then,
the three of us together. Rin… This time, let's spend... some alone time together. Just you and me. Kakashi would just be in the way. I'll leave him here. YOU BETTER…


 Why? I thought we had both resolved to… Your power is still needed here! We need to rebuild chakra again. Mother, let's teleport to
the Root Time-Space… You'll recover faster there, too. Why would you do this
for someone useless like me? Never mind that. Kakashi, be wary of the enemy. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura… This is a crucial time for them. Kakashi, you must survive
and support the next generation. It's too soon for you to die. It's totally useless, Naruto. He's a goner. He'll rot away like trash and die. Enough, Naruto. He's right. Don't waste your chakra. Why do you sympathize with him? He was originally your enemy, right? Then again,
he's a traitor to us now. A loser on both sides. Hated and resented
by friend and foe alike, with no one to call
comrade or family… He's alone, with nothing left. He's lost everyone precious to him, and he can't realize his dreams. And after being used up,
he's helpless at the end… He's a fool, filled with
nothing but mistakes… You've done nothing but—! You're right… Rin…again… I'll create a world where
we can be together again. I shall… sever the nexuses… of this world. Now go on… Until I will be revived… You shall be… Who are you? I am Madara Uchiha. But a world of just
victors, peace, and love… Such a world can be created too. If you allow us to collaborate,
you can learn how. Let's go, Konan… Nagato. We can't trust these guys! Don't ever approach us again! You'll eventually realize it too. Who are you? You are going to be
very useful to me. RIN NOHARA
 Summoning Jutsu! Minato Sensei… I hereby declare the start of
the Fourth Great Ninja War. They each have formidable strength. And I have even more
up my sleeve. So be it.
We will join forces with you. They will know despair thoroughly. You're right. It's an end worthy of
the criminal that I am. My Visual Prowess is back! We've been here before! Did she change worlds again?! Naruto! Naruto, I'll handle
the diversions this time. He's beyond help. Come with me. I'm going on ahead! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! That's enough. Thank you, Naruto After fighting you,
I feel like I've woken up. You and I are both powerless shinobi. You… no, I should say everyone… will eventually end up like me. I'll never end up like you! How many times
do I have to tell you?! My dream is to become
the Hokage! There is no reason to keep on
fighting for a world like this. In a few minutes,
this world will be gone anyway. Why do you still fight?! Because it's my Ninja Way. I never go back on my word. Don't overdo it.
Let's call it a day. No, I'm not giving up. Didn't I make a promise? That I'm gonna become
the Hokage! Really… It was as if I saw my past self
when I looked at you. And I regret what I am now. But for some reason,
it also made me happy. As a kid, I would imagine myself
as Hokage so often. That indescribable feeling
of exhilaration and anxiety… I think you brought
that all back for me. Don't cry, Obito.
You'll get laughed at. I know. Besides, the world of shinobi
is all about fighting. It's nowhere near
a peaceful world. And I'll put an end to it,
no matter what. Hey, you're not the only ones. Don't forget that we're here too. Yeah, that's right. Rin… I… What's that? The higher-ups have decided. Obito, you're going to be
the next Hokage. But you're just as qualified… A supportive role suits me better. I'm sure Rin would say
the same thing. But if you screw up,
I won't hesitate to step up as a candidate
to become the next Hokage. What?! Do your best! RIN NOHARA
 This is driving me crazy! All this paperwork
day in and day out. That can't be helped… You're the Hokage now. Besides, something like this
sure beats having to fight every day. That's for sure. It's the Hokage! Lord Hokage! Hello! Lord Hokage,
are you on your rounds? Well, yes. Yeah, right! You're just goofing off, right? Speak for yourself! What?! Wanna make something of it? Cut it out! Why did you hit only me? Because you were rude
to Lord Hokage! Seriously… It's so peaceful, thanks to you. Not just me. It's everyone who did their best
to support the village. It would be nice to talk
to Rin someday. Yeah. Imagining the village, friends,
and me as the Hokage… Even after all that's happened… Just the thought of it seems to
fill up the hole in my heart. Maybe it's because it's the end, I find myself rambling all of a sudden. Ouch! Don't act tough and
hide your wounds. I'm always watching you. You promised me that
you would become Hokage, Obito. Listen, I want to stop this war too. I really want to save the world. So I've decided to stick by
your side and watch over you. You told me saving you was the same as saving
the world, remember? Yeah! Since I'm keeping
an eye on you, you can't hide anything
from me anymore. Okay! Okay! Go for it, Obito! Become Hokage and show me
how you'll save the world. That's another promise! Let's go! A lot more suffering
likely awaits you, Naruto. But don't ever change and hang on to your Ninja Way. You once told me that never going back on your word
is your Ninja Way, right? Yeah… Naruto… You better... become Hokage! Yeah! The vermin traitor has
finally died, eh? He was vermin and
persistent as a cockroach. Don't laugh at Obito! Naruto… Naruto… If you keep resisting, you'll end up pitifully crumbling
to ash just like him! As someone who tried
to become Hokage, Obito is nothing but… awesome to me! Rin! I've been waiting. Really? Sorry, I made you wait. Seems you got lost along the way. Yeah… A lot of things happened
before I could come here. Rin, you know... that promise I made to you… No, you did your best! I've been watching you all along! Let's go! Come on, Obito.

 Rin, do you mind waiting
just a little longer?

 Obito?

 Only a little bit before
we move on…

 I'd like to make one
more detour along the way.

 Really… Who do you want
to save this time?

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Sharingan Revived"

 I'll be waiting, right here.


 THE SHARINGAN REVIVED
 

 Tune in again!


 The vermin traitor has finally died, eh? He was vermin…
and persistent as a cockroach. Don't laugh at Obito! Naruto… Naruto… If you keep resisting, you'll end up pitifully crumbling
to ash just like him! As someone who tried to
become Hokage, Obito is… …nothing but awesome to me! No way! I can't move! I don't even have
much strength left, and yet, I was left behind again? Are you all right, Rin?
Kakashi? Obito! Don't… It's okay, Kakashi. I don't think I can make it… My right side is totally crushed. I can't even feel anything… Damn it! I'm giving you my Sharingan. Whatever the village may say… you are…a great jonin. That's how I really feel… So please accept it. Kakashi… – Rin!
– Rin! Again, you… Thank you, Rin. Obito and I will be
joining you shortly. We can catch up then,
the three of us together… Rin… This time, let's… spend some alone time together.
Just you and me… Kakashi would just be in the way. I'll leave him here. This is…Kamui! Obito! You! Kakashi…
you stay here a little while longer. Don't you rush to follow us! Why, Obito? What am I even here for? THE SHARINGAN REVIVED
 

 This is embarrassing…
Screwing up like that in front of you. It looks like
you've calmed down a bit. Okay, Obito. Rin, do you mind waiting
just a bit longer? Obito? Only a little bit before
we move on… I'd like to make one more
detour along the way. Who do you want to save this time? Kakashi. I've finally gotten alone time with you. It'll be wasted if he ends up
coming here right away. Besides… He's out there helpless. Just like his namesake, he's a scarecrow
in the middle of a garden… And I'm sort of annoyed by it. Despite all that's happened,
you two are still close, huh? N-No way! We're oil and water! So? You can go just like that? Yeah… Chakra is an energy
that connects two worlds. I'm gonna go see Kakashi! I'll be waiting right here. Sorry, Rin!
I'll be right back! Obito?! Before I go to the next world,
I thought I'd emphasize to you… to not to come
running after me so quickly. Besides, it's going to
keep bothering me if this eye I gave you to
celebrate your promotion to jonin, came back to me. Obito, you… Then again, it's not like I'll be
springing back to life anymore. More importantly, you know how I told Naruto
to become Hokage? I meant to say as the Seventh. You be the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi. I know you haven't taken office yet,
but I'm giving you your gift now. It has a fixed time limit,
but it isn't useless. Do you get what I'm saying? I mean…you haven't forgotten
your famous nickname that's known throughout
the lands, have you? That name, Kakashi of the Sharingan! Let's do this, guys! Mmhm. Yes! Yup! All right! Roger. Sure thing! Gotcha! Yeah! Here we go! Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast
Rasen-Shuriken! Nice, Naruto! There's no way they can
come out of that unscathed. Oh no! Don't tell me Mother's—! What's that? She turned into
another gigantic thing? What is that? A wolf? Tanuki? Badger? Or a rabbit? It doesn't matter.
Now it's easier to get close. And it'll be easier to seal her! It's not…humanoid? Mother didn't transform into
Ten Tails of her own will. Are the Tailed Beasts
within her resonating in response to Naruto's attack
and starting to split apart? They're not stable! Sasuke, don't get grabbed
by that white hand! It will absorb you instantly! And it's fast too! I know that! Sasuke! Protect Sakura with
your Visual Prowess! All right, way to go! A Susano'o?! Whose was it? W-What? That wasn't you?! What's going on?! Kakashi Sensei! Thank you…Obito. That's impossible. No way! Sure it is! We are talking about the Copy Ninja,
Kakashi of the Sharingan! But he shouldn't have
the Sharingan anymore… I don't get it, but he saved me! You watch along with me. This time, I'll protect them… and the world! Here it comes! How about this? Combining the power
of the Kamui into… shuriken! Kamui Shuriken! Just as I thought… Gaining Six Path's power enhances
one's Visual Prowess too! This power…
It's Obito's Sharingan? But why does
Kakashi Sensei have it? Wow! That's more amazing
than yours, Sasuke! This chakra is—! This Root Time-Space is
Mother's exclusive domain, where she can
directly extract chakra from shinobi trapped in
the Infinite Tsukuyomi! The Tailed Beasts are now stable, and Mother has even produced
a Truthseeker Orb… An Expansive Kekkei Moura
Truthseeker Orb that contains
each and every nature… Wind, fire, earth, lightning,
water, shadow, and light. It is the beginning of
a new Time-Space. And you all will
become its sacrifice! That thing! It's the same sphere
as the one behind me! The difference in size is too drastic! And it's growing rapidly! I definitely can't teleport away such
a gigantic object with the Kamui. Even if we get out of this Time-Space
and escape temporarily… If that thing becomes too big,
we won't be able to return here. In order to stop that… We need to seal
that Rabbit Granny away right now! You're right. Gather 'round. I've got a plan. This will be our last mission
as the former Squad 7! We're going to save the world! Yeah! Roger! I am immortal. If either of you die,
you cannot seal me away. Now then... Which shall it be? You're mine, damn it! No, we attack her together. She's scared of being sealed
and her attention will be divided! Take me part of the way.
Then I'll fly the rest of the way. Right! So fast! Mother just gained more power. Both her power and speed
are now exponentially greater! Being able to pass through things,
really is a handy ability, Obito… And now, I can resurrect this move too! Kamui Lightning Blade! Mother! This is bad!
Her right arm! There's not enough time to escape
into another Time-Space! Then! So they were both
Ashura's reincarnates, after all. They must have,
switched back then. So then, the one on the right
is the real one! Kamui! Not good. I'll go to the Ice World… No… The Indra reincarnate
possesses the Amaterasu… That wouldn't be good! Don't forget about me!
We're both women… so don't mock me! Naruto…Sasuke…Sakura! A silly prank… Still, if this prank
was the result of teamwork… He fell for it! So Naruto's the perp. I'm so sorry, Sensei.
I tried to stop him, but Naruto… Sakura makes excuses
and tries to protect herself. Sasuke minds his own business. He probably doesn't
consider them comrades. There's not
a shred of teamwork… How do I put this… My first impression of you guys
is not good! I'll go! I'll go! I'm Naruto Uzumaki!
I love instant ramen. But I love the ramen at Ichiraku that
Iruka Sensei treats me to even more! And I hate having to wait three minutes
after pouring in the hot water. My future dream is… to surpass the Hokage! And that's why I'm going to make everyone in
the village acknowledge me! My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular. And I don't feel like summing up
my ambition as just a dream, but I do have an ambition. The ambition to restore my clan
and to kill a certain man without fail! I'm Sakura Haruno. What I like…
I mean, who I like is… My future dream is… They're all wrapped up
in themselves. They're far from
working together as a team. Although we were just like that… Oh well, I'll just have
to do what I can. Yup… You guys make
a pretty picture right now. Now! Cha! All right! I really love you guys! We finally made it out!

 Kurama!
Your Jinchuriki sure gets it done!

 Now it's happily ever after!

 Yeah!

 Hold on a sec!
What about us?

 How are we supposed to
get out of this Time-Space?

 Oh, you're right!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Congratulations"


 But…he's still pretty dumb,
isn't he?


 CONGRATULATIONS


 Tune in again!

 Don't forget about me! We're both women,
so don't mock me! Naruto…Sasuke…Sakura! You guys make
a nice picture right now. I really love you guys! Now! Cha! All right! Six Paths Planetary Devastation! To think that I,
the originator of chakra… would be defeated by pieces of
my own chakra, again… Why?! Hmm? They've done it! All that's left is to bring
you all back! Is the ground being
sucked up towards her? We finally made it out! Kurama, your Jinchuriki's pretty good. CONGRATULATIONS


 Over here! Sasuke! What happened to Naruto? He went off by himself, saying there was something
he had to take care of. More importantly, we need to
get farther away from here! At this point, it can't be helped. I'll just start over and work on
Mother's next resurrection! That reminds me, you don't like being separated
from your mom, right? D-Damn you! I haven't forgotten about you. Hiding in the shadows
and creeping around for all this time! You! You're just a piece of
the shinobi history I created. A brat like you could never…! History? Shinobi history… consists of all sorts of ninja's lives,
and deaths! Many shinobi taught me
what it means to be a shinobi. The pain and sadness of death…
the tragedy of war. And not only that! They taught me the joy of
being accepted and being loved! The way they lived…
and the way they died… made me who I am! They taught me and trusted me! You're a brat who
can't even leave the nest! Get over yourself! It's still growing. It's like a moon. Guys! It's over. The seal is complete! We can finally celebrate! You're right. The first thing I want is a hot bath to wash away all
this sweat and grime. Hold on a sec!
What about us?! How are we supposed to
get out of this Time-Space?! Oh no! You're right!
This is bad! This is bad! He does whatever
needs to get done. But he's still pretty dumb, isn't he? Summoning Jutsu! Welcome home, Naruto. Dad… Naruto, who's this? Six Paths Super Gramps! Which means… That's right,
you're back in your world through a Summoning performed
by all prior Five Kage together. I called all of
the previous Five Kage from the afterworld to help. Naruto, Sasuke… and the rest of you… Excellent work saving the world. Six Paths Super Gramps? Are you by any chance
the legendary…? I am Hagoromo Otsutsuki. Also known as
the Sage of the Six Paths. No wonder…you're levitating. At this point,
nothing shocks me anymore. It seems like everything
went well. The Shinobi World sure went to
hell while we were dead. Damn it! It's the first time I've seen so many
Tailed Beasts together in one place! The Sage of the Six Paths, eh… It feels like we've wandered
into a fairy tale! So you are the one, after all. Summoning the past
Five Kage here and... being able to bring the Tailed Beasts
and us back from the other Time-Space… You're probably the only person
who could perform such godly actions. Are you Kakashi Hatake? Oh…yes. Good job guiding everyone and
sealing my mother away. That truly was the work of gods. Oh, no. I hardly played any part at all. It was these three
and many comrades. And…a former friend also
lent me strength. That's why I said you
guided everyone well. Despite losing your way, you remained Naruto's teacher
and Obito's friend. Or else, you likely wouldn't have
succeeded in stopping my mother. Hey! Kurama! Were you lonely being
separated from me? I missed you! Don't talk so loud! I wasn't lonely. You have half of me
inside you…remember? Just look at Kurama,
all embarrassed and flustered! But this is exactly
what I had once envisioned. That there would one day
be a shinobi, who could move even
the Tailed Beasts to cooperate. Even Obito was Naruto's doing… He restored Obito. I see… Then I shall ask Obito to tell me
that tale in the afterworld. Is he still…? I‘m gonna get going soon. Yeah… I really made a mess out
of the Shinobi World. So much that I don't even know
what to say to you before I go. We're able to say goodbye
as friends, not enemies. To the old you… the one who was always late
because you were helping others. That's plenty enough for me. Thanks, Kakashi. I'll be going then. I've been keeping Rin waiting. Do you have an excuse ready? I told her beforehand
I'd be helping you. I see… Same here… Thank you, Obito. Kakashi Sensei! Sakura… Thank you. Kakashi Sensei, your eyes! Yeah… As of today, Kakashi of
the Sharingan is no more. Madara was a Jinchuriki.
Even if it was temporary… emptied of the Tailed Beast,
he won't last long. It's his fault for trying
to use such things. Sasuke, Naruto… Behold, the end of
your predecessors. You should watch this closely. Is that you, Hashirama? I guess neither you,
nor I could achieve what we wanted. It's never that easy! Our job is to do all that we can,
while we're alive. And then, bequeath the rest for
future generations to accomplish. So naïve… as usual. You…were always…the optimist. But perhaps… that is the correct path. My dream… was squashed. But your dream… still lives on. We were both too hasty. We didn't need to fulfill
our dreams ourselves. It was more important to cultivate
those who would come after us… to whom we could entrust
our dreams. Which means I would
have failed anyway. Since I always hated someone…
standing behind me… When we were kids… You once said we're shinobi and we don't know
when we'll die. And that for neither side to die, we'd both have to reveal
what's inside of us and pour each other drinks
to toast like brothers. But we're both about to die. Right now, we can drink together,
as war buddies. War buddies…huh? Well… I guess…that's okay… by… This is the perfect moment. I will release the jutsu,
free the Five Kages and those under the Reanimation. Go. Dad… Oh, that's right. I've been meaning to tell you… Happy birthday! You've become
a splendid young man, Naruto Yeah… Thank you. We're an existence outside
of the rules. We can't remain
in this world forever. It's time to say good-bye. I promise to tell
Kushina everything. Tell her not to worry.
I'm eating properly! I'm not picky and eat
lots of different stuff! Like, tonkotsu ramen,
miso ramen, and shoyu ramen… Oh but, not just ramen though! I try to bathe every day! I go to the Leaf Hot Springs
once in a while too! Although everyone just says
I only take quick dips… What else, what else… I've made lots of friends! And they're all good guys! And… I was really awful at school,
but I never got depressed and had more confidence
than anyone else! Naturally, I always obeyed Lord Third and Kakashi Sensei. I respect them both! They're right here,
so you can ask them yourself! Oh! And those
Three Prohibitions of Shinobi? I learned a lot about that
when I was with Pervy Sage! He was hopeless
when it came to them though… but he was
an awesome Sannin and I respect him the most! I just turned 17 today, so I don't know much
about alcohol or girls… I know Mom said to find
someone like her… But…that's…um… Anyways! Not everything
Mom told me about went well, but I'm doing the best I can! I've got dreams too! I'm gonna become an even
greater Hokage than you, Dad! I swear I will! So when you see Mom over there,
please tell her… that she doesn't have to
worry about me at all! Tell her I'm doin' my best! Got it… I'll make sure
to tell her everything. Having fought
my mother Kaguya…

 Is there any change to
the answers you gave me?

 My answer's the same.

 Now then, Sasuke…
What about you?

 Yes, but first…

 the current Five Kage inside
the Infinite Tsukuyomi…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Final Valley"

 What did you just say, Sasuke?!


 THE FINAL VALLEY
 

 Tune in again!

 I've got dreams too! I'm gonna become an even greater
Hokage than you, Dad! I swear I will! So when you see Mom over there,
please tell her… that she doesn't have to
worry about me at all! Tell her I'm doin' my best! THE FINAL VALLEY


 We're leaving the rest to you…
Kakashi, Sakura… Sasuke and Naruto. Lord Third! Elder Brother, you finally
settled things with Madara. As Saru said… let's leave the rest
to the next generation. Naruto Uzumaki… Sasuke Uchiha… You two will probably find
a different conclusion than we did. No…make sure you do. Now, we're free too! I'm going back to Suirendo! I'm going to seclude myself in a forest. We can finally go back to our homes. It's like a dream. Eight Tails, what are you gonna do? Me? Well… I think I'm gonna go back to Bee. Even his annoying rap
has ended up growing on me. So, what about you? What will you do? I'll… A little piece of each of your chakra… is already within Naruto. In short, Naruto is like
a gathering place for you. If you want to discuss something, you can speak to each other through
your chakra inside Naruto. Kurama… Hmm? I'd like you to stay inside Naruto as
the overseer of the gathering place. It's no longer a hardship
for you anymore, is it? Well, if you say so, old man,
I guess have no choice. What?!
What's so funny? Still not upfront with your feelings…
You haven't changed at all, Kurama. So the Great Ninja War
is finally over now. Yes. All that's left is… Naruto and Sasuke…
I asked you before. After battling my mother Kaguya, is there any change to
the answers you gave me? My answer's the same. And I'm sorry, Super Gramps, but there is one thing I feel
strongly about after fighting Kaguya… I'm really glad that
Kushina Uzumaki was my mom. Kaguya was different from
anyone I've ever battled. It's like she didn't have a heart at all. It's said my mother Kaguya started off
as a beloved goddess of the people. I do not know for sure what
caused her to transform into a being that came to
be called a demon. I suspect something was triggered the moment she devoured
the Chakra Fruit. In any case,
you are not like my mother. I trust you not to become like her, even with all of the Tailed Beast
Chakra within you. Now then, all that's left is… to undo the Infinite Tsukuyomi. But how, specifically?
Do you need our powers? No, you're fine. Naruto has the chakra
of every Tailed Beast. And Sasuke possesses the Rinnegan. If they both weave
the sign for rat simultaneously, the jutsu will be undone. What? That's it? It's so simple. I researched thoroughly how to
undo Mother's Infinite Tsukuyomi. There's no mistake. Now then,
the rest is up to you, Sasuke. Yes… But first, I'm executing the current
Five Kage inside the Infinite Tsukuyomi. What did you just say, Sasuke? What about the Five Kage? Oh, and… I'm putting all of you Tailed Beasts
under my control… and eventually,
I'll get rid of you as well. What did you say?! Kurama! He put the Tailed Beasts
in a genjutsu… and with a single glance too. Naruto, it has ended up
as I expected. I have no choice
but to leave the rest to you. I cannot stay in
this world any longer. I shall soon fade away. Yeah, and sorry for saying this,
Six Paths Super Gramps… but we won't end up like your sons. I'm not Ashura. And Sasuke isn't Indra either. Sasuke!
Is this what your current dream is? Are you saying you're
still seeking vengeance? Sasuke! I admit, at one time,
all I wished for was destruction, and vengeance was my goal. But I feel differently now. I want to destroy, and rebuild. A village no longer
shrouded in darkness. I'll reform the shinobi world. What I'm touting is… …revolution! Revolution?! My dear Sasuke,
what do you want to do? What is it that you seek
in the aftermath of this war? I want to hear your honest thoughts
and opinions. All of the previous Kage created
these current circumstances. So I will become Hokage
and change the village. This Hokage you speak of…
What do you mean by it? If want to know so badly,
I'll tell you. Catastrophic Planetary Devastation! Naruto…
It's on you! I swear
I'll get you all out! Just hang in there
a little while longer! Because of this war, I've become quite adept at
using my Rinnegan's abilities. And all those who were
in my way are gone. Except for you… Naruto. Things just don't go as planned. When I bequeathed power
to just one side, I ended up with Indra and Ashura. This time, even after entrusting power
to both, the result is the same. Nope… All sibling squabbling
ends right here! Let the Tailed Beasts go.
They've finally gained freedom. I'm friends with them, so I know. They won't cause trouble anymore. Naruto, you don't seem to get it. You're now the Jinchuriki
of all the Tailed Beasts. Which means I plan to
eventually get rid of the Tailed Beast Chakra
inside of you too. What?! In other words,
you're going to die, Naruto. Out of necessity. If what the Sage said was true,
there's no need to use the Tailed Beast power inside you
to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi. I can take advantage of
the Tailed Beasts that I captured. I'll let them live until then. You know that I won't
let you do that, right? I guess I'll have to
deal with you first, Naruto. Let's move this elsewhere.
You know, don't you? Wait, Sasuke! Sensei! The lingering aftereffects
of the Sharingan… I… I know in my heart that
there's nothing I can do! Even though I love you. Even though I care about you
so much, Sasuke. And yet… I can't get close to you
or exchange blows with you. I can only whine and beg
and cry like this again. It's so pitiful, isn't it? Sakura… Thank you. But…But Sasuke! If there's even a little corner of
your heart that thinks about me, please don't leave again! If we stick together,
I know it can be like old times again… You're… …really annoying. Sakura! You didn't need to put Sakura
under genjutsu! If I didn't, she would've chased after us,
and gotten in the way. Sakura…Sakura just wanted
to help you, all this time. So you're suggesting
I enjoy a little romance? Well, I have no reason to love her
or be loved by her. The only time you need a reason
is when you hate someone! And Sakura's not trying to
make you hers! She just wants to help you! She almost died
by your hand. But she still thinks of your welfare
and sheds tears for you… because she suffers from loving you! Mom… How does Dad really feel
about Big Brother and me? What makes you ask that
out of the blue? The other day, he said to me,
"That's my boy." He usually says that to Big Brother,
so I was really happy. Is that so? That's nice. But recently, Dad and Big Brother
haven't been getting along, so… I thought maybe I'm just
a stand-in for Big Brother… Your brother is your brother,
and you are you. Your father is always
thinking about the both of you. Then why is it always
about Big Brother?! That's not the case. Your father represents our clan, and he's expected to
protect the Uchiha Clan. So what? It's just that Itachi is older than you,
and your senior. So he's given more duties
relating to the clan. Since your father
oversees those duties, it's only natural that his eyes
will be more focused on Itachi. But this is just between us… When your father is with me,
all he talks about is you. He's always so serious, and just not very good at
expressing his feelings. Here's your lunch, Sasuke. When you come home,
I'll watch over your shuriken practice. It's not practice. It's training. I'm leaving! Have a great day. Perhaps, those are the ties
to a failed past. Sasuke! I made a promise. Long ago…to Sakura. I'll definitely bring Sasuke back! I swear on my life! Sensei! You know about
my Ninja Way, right? I'm gonna go. Yeah… We're counting on you. Love is a difficult thing… I once had two sons. I loved them both,
and they loved and revered me. But I entrusted everything
to the younger brother. That became the impetus for the older brother to begin
hating his brother and me. Love transformed into hate. What molded the current Sasuke, is none other than
his loss of love in the past. Madara was the same too. Are you saying that Sasuke shares
the same fate as Madara? No, not at all. I, too, want to make the future
better in my own way. Having learned from past mistakes,
this time I gave both of them the power. The past does not exist to remind the present that
the future cannot change. The past is supposed to exist
for the sake of the future. How did you see the potential
within Naruto? Naruto Uzumaki… The boy was able to save
and befriend Kurama, who had become
a concretion of hatred. I shall let Naruto handle this. Since I hope that hate can be
transformed into love this time. Or rather, I have hope that
love can be regained. Because, unlike my mother,
Naruto as well as Sasuke… know what love is. This place, huh?
I should've figured. Doesn't it bring back memories,
Sasuke? Long ago, we fought here. And just like before,
you're going to lose. You won't be hitting me with
that same punch as last time! I'm not about to let you get away
with whatever you want. I won't let you become
the Hokage, either! You don't even understand
what it means to be Hokage! I told you, that to me,
being Hokage means revolution. It's totally different from what you think. Let me tell you something
your big brother said… It's not the one who
becomes Hokage who gets acknowledged by all. But it's the one acknowledged by all
who becomes Hokage. I learned not from Itachi's words,
but from the way he lived his life. You and I came up
with different answers. Let me clarify this
before we battle… I'll teach you exactly what being
Hokage means to me. You don't understand the way
Itachi lived his life at all!

 Itachi is now in my past.

 I will cut off everything
in my past right here…

 Starting with cutting you down.

 Yours will be
the last blood I shed…

 in the memory
of my late older brother.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Final Battle"


 I won't let you!


 THE FINAL BATTLE


 Tune in again!


 Naruto… Sometimes your eyes
are better than mine. Sasuke is in the darkness
right now… Go… You're the only one
who can save him. Yeah… I know. The Final Battle

 My explanation of
what it means to be Hokage represents my response. The way Itachi lived
led me to this answer. To protect the Land of Fire
and the Leaf Village, he sacrificed both
his clan and himself. First, I needed to know why. What is this Land and Village
that he would go so far to protect? The previous Hokage said… …that the village is a framework created to stop the slaughter
of clans and children… …a framework that was
supposed to lead to peace. Itachi tried to sustain
that peace all by himself. That's when I finally understood… Suffering bitter experiences,
living in darkness as a criminal and traitor
against Land and Village… He was a shinobi
who took on all hatred and protected the Land of Fire and
the Leaf Village from the shadows. I feel he was the true Hokage. It's not the one who is
acknowledged by all… …but the one who
accepts all the hatred that is worthy of that title. I eventually came to understand
Itachi's feelings for his Land and Village. My big brother failed
in just one aspect. He let me,
his little brother, live. Unable to hide the truth from me, he allowed the hatred
to disseminate. However… I'm not like
my Big Brother anymore. I have no father, mother, brother… not even a single member
of my clan. I am all alone. I alone can bear the weight
of all the hatred now. And I alone will deal
with everything personally. I will handle all of
the shinobi's problems. I will also dispense
all judgment and punishment. I'll concentrate
all hatred upon myself… …and bring together every
single village under my control. Hatred inside darkness
cannot be eliminated. In which case, I'd rather… That's right…
What the Hokage is to me… …is someone who will sear away
the darkness of all Five Villages with only his own flame. And then keeps living
by eating the ashes. And you think everyone will just
sit back and say "yes" to that? I told you already… I don't care what you
or anyone else thinks. Besides, I have the power now
to control it all. You don't have a clue
about how Itachi lived! There are things
you can't do alone! Just like our battle with Kaguya! But things don't always go well… Like with these two stone statues And us two brothers… With revolution… …the villages will no longer
have to bear darkness. And I alone
will become the darkness. I'll dispose of the deep darkness
of the past, and build a pure white future
from scratch. You mean by killing
the Tailed Beasts, and the Five Kage?! Exactly. I'm casting off the past. You're saying you can pretend
nothing ever happened with Itachi? You and Itachi were brothers,
and a lot happened between you… That's what made you
who you are today! Itachi is now in my past. I'm cutting all past mistakes and
doubts here, and starting anew. Beginning by cutting you down. Yours will be
the last blood I shed, in the memory of my late brother. I won't…let you kill me. I learned everything I know
from the people of my past! Especially about how to figure out
what to do after making a mistake. You said you consider
Sasuke a brother. That's why, Naruto, I believe you are the only one
who can stop Sasuke. I'm leaving Sasuke to you. That's why… I won't let you kill me. Lord Sage! It seems it's almost time. What… What should I be doing? Just continue to have faith. Right now, that is all we can do. What you do and what transpires,
will be up to the two of you. Sasuke and I aren't real brothers, but I think we can make peace
with each other. Now that Itachi's gone, I feel like I'm finally,
truly alone. But with Naruto, he's the one person
I have to cut down. My version of the Hokage
can only come to be by severing all bonds
and being alone. Why? Because… Because to me… …we're really good friends. …he is still my closest friend. Naruto… Sasuke…
Show me your answer… Show me the answer for all shinobi! Inferno Style: Honoikazuchi! His left eye is… How the hell do you think
you understand? You've been alone from the start! It's because I have these ties,
that I feel this agony. How could you possibly understand what it feels like
to lose all that?! What's the matter? Are you just going to play defense? If you keep stalling, you'll die. I don't wanna kill you! To me, you've become
my closest friend. You're trying to be alone again
and I can't let that happen! Especially since we both know
what that's like… That's why I can't let you… …go there… …intentionally! Quit yapping. We're both different from the two boys who
fought here long ago… I know your heart… …and you, mine… But you still wanna fight me? All the more, because it's you. I have to cut you out of my life. There's no guarantee that the world you'll rebuild
after severing the past… …won't end up just like this one,
you know. That's exactly why I'll continue
to watch over that world… So it doesn't. You're missing the point! The Five Villages
are finally united! Yeah… But that's only because
they found a common enemy. To defeat the Akatsuki, Madara,
and Kaguya… the Five Villages had no choice
but to discard their grudges and form an alliance
in order to survive. But their mutual foes are now gone. Eventually, conflicts between
each village will begin again. So this time,
you're gonna become the enemy? And? What'll happen
after you're gone? Finally, all the dots have connected
and formed a straight line. I started with the Sharingan and now, I possess
the power of the Rinnegan. Reincarnation, immortality…
I have many options. I'll also be able to control things
from the shadows, instead of through battle. You're planning to
return to that hell, for the rest of your life,
or rather for all eternity? While being hated by all? To me,
that's what a Hokage ought to be. That's not even
close enough to kill me. I told you!
I'm not trying to kill you! I'm—! Enough. I'm the strongest in
this world right now. So right now, right here… will be my first step
into the shadows. I can feel it,

 how did he gain so much
Nature Energy so suddenly?

 You finally decided to kill me, huh?

 We've taken on
a lot of responsibilities

 upon our shoulders…

 But you see, I wanna fight,

 and win against you
fair and square!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
Naruto and Sasuke


 …but not against the current you!


 NARUTO AND SASUKE


 Tune in again!

 This is bad… He's merging all the chakra
that's been scattered into one… And doing it unbelievably well too,
almost unrivaled. He's just as good as
Old Man Six Paths… Well, except he's doing
the reverse thing… There's no Gedo Statue here, so he's making the Susano'o
the receiving vessel. Something incredible
is going to emerge… Don't let down your guard, Naruto! That jutsu again? Naruto… That jutsu of yours
symbolizes your weakness. That's right… It's a jutsu that covers up your loneliness! Why that—! You only hold a little piece of
each Tailed Beast's chakra… You can't win against me now. Nor this… Not yet?! Kurama! I might have amassed too much, in fact. It's everything that's available. Here it comes! Here it comes! I can feel it! How did he gain so much
Nature Energy so suddenly? Let's do this! Yeah! You finally decided to kill me, huh? We've taken on a lot of responsibilities
upon our shoulders… But you see, I… I want to fight you too. I wanna fight,
and win against you fair and square! But… …not against the current you! You already know that too… right, Sasuke?! This fight with you right now,
will be my last. Indra's Arrow… Currently the most powerful jutsu
in my arsenal… So just…die. Just be gone already! Damn it… You're not—! Naruto! If my Nature Energy
didn't make it to you in time, you'd have been
blown away just now! And your chakra's already
long been drained from— Amaterasu! Only a diversion, huh? I can't actually take
him down with this… I need the Tailed Beasts… I've used too much chakra…
can't maintain control! At this rate, I can't use
my left eye's abilities either! He's still not—! Give it up already… – Sasuke!
– Naruto! Damn it! Sasuke wins! All right, both of you,
make the Unison Sign. Not even a nod of acknowledgment?! You jerk! I've got to get this off my chest! You turd! No, you hard, drippy turd! Ouch! I told you that shinobi Kumite is
a time-honored and sacred tradition! Now, make the Unison Sign now! You're finally awake. It's dusk already. Where are Sasuke and Naruto? They're currently fighting
their final battle… …in order to settle things for good. Hang in there! It's not much but I've finished
infusing some more chakra—! This is one of the abilities
of the Rinnegan. As someone who possesses
the eyes of the Uchiha… My victory is inevitable. Now… Now, I can finally be alone! Farewell… My one and only… friend! That was a great counter! You didn't miss the fact that
his Visual Prowess is weakened! Over and… …over and… …over and… …over and… …over and… …over and over and
and over over again! Just give up and
let me cut you down! Can't do that. 'Cuz I'm your one and only friend! I figured as much… He's assimilated the chakra
I created and infused for you, and made it his own… And now Flame Control… He intends to finish this
with one last blast. Listen, I'm giving what remains
of my own chakra… Once I do that,
it's gonna put me to sleep. Don't unleash your jutsu
until the last minute, so he doesn't absorb
more chakra from you. Well, not that he can use
his newly awakened Rinnegan to absorb chakra while
putting out his own jutsu… Who are you to be so confident when
you couldn't even save Sasuke? I've never given up… Once you give up, it's over. I will save Sasuke, and… I'm coming after all that hate
inside you too, someday! Now go… You're the one and only
for us too… That's why Sasuke is… NARUTO AND SASUKE

 Am I dead?

 This sensation…
it must be…probably.

 Sorry, Grandma Tsunade.

 I promised I wouldn't die…

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"The Unison Sign"


 …until I became the Hokage.


 Tune in again!

 Naruto… Just disappear already… and take our bond along with you! Sasuke wins! All right, you two…
make the Unison Sign. You wanna piece of me, you loser? What is this? Sasuke… If you and I fight… We'll both... die. Am I dead? This sensation… It must be… Probably. Pitiful, isn't it? You had the Nine Tails… and I was an Uchiha. We were ostracized from the village
and treated like outcasts. And we resented the village
and its people. Right? I won't let you say I'm wrong. You called me your brother…
In that sense, perhaps we were. You're totally wrong! Damn it,
you don't understand, do you? Sorry, Grandma Tsunade… I promised…I wouldn't die… until I became the Hokage… Oh yeah! The Infinite Tsukuyomi! This is bad! The Release Jutsu can't be activated
without us being there, right?! You're dead…and you're worried
about what happens to the world? Of course! We can't leave it like that! Sakura and Kakashi still remain. They'll figure something out. I hope so. Naruto! The Hokage, huh… Pretty soon, Big Brother, they might
carve your Great Stone Face over there! Big Brother? Forgive me, Sasuke.
This is it. And no matter what you do
from here on out, know this… I will love you always. Big Brother… I'll be seeing you…soon. You've finally come to, eh? As you can see… if either of us moves too much,
we'll bleed out and die. Why would you go that far? Why do all that… just to get in my way? I gained the power to enter the darkness,
and sever all bonds… And naturally, everyone's tried to cut
their ties to me as well, at some point. But you… You've never attempted
to cut me off. The only one who can handle
all that hatred is me! Why do you keep
involving yourself with me? You already know, don't you? Now that your body can't move,
your mouth sure is moving a lot. Just answer me! 'Cuz you're my friend. What is it with you anyway? I'm your friend! Just what the hell do you want?
Why are you so fixated on me? It's because I'm your friend! I've heard that before. But what exactly does that mean to you anyway? You ask me to explain it,
but I really can't put it into words. It's just that… when I see you take on stuff… and get all messed up… It kinda… hurts me. It hurts so much inside, that I can't just leave it alone, y'know? Though right now, I'm in a lot of pain
all over, and I can't do anything about it. Naruto… I knew you were
always alone back then. The village shunned you,
just like they did with me… the lone Uchiha survivor. You intentionally did stupid things
to get scolded, most likely to get people's attention. In the beginning, I thought
you were good for nothing. A weakling who just constantly
wanted to goof around. But the more I watched you being idiotic
and getting scolded over and over… For some reason,
it started weighing on my mind. I thought back then, that your weakness
was gradually rubbing off on me. Then, every time I'd see you,
I'd think about you more and more. Seeing you desperately
trying to bond with others… made me remember my own family. And I don't know why,
but I felt relief. But at the same time,
I considered it a weakness. I trained hard
as if to escape that weakness. In order to get my revenge
on my brother to become stronger than him. And yet… I ended up
on the same team as you. And I began thinking about
my family again. I went on missions with you as you jabbered on and on
about becoming Hokage… I saw how both of us
were getting stronger… And one day, I started to feel
the desire to fight you too. And I began to see a shadow
of my own family in Squad 7… That's why every time
I saw you suffering… That's right…
I felt it… I felt pain too. When I understood your hurt,
I finally saw you as a comrade. But on the other hand… I couldn't leave you alone.
You were getting stronger and stronger. Watching you steadily get stronger… I… I knew that you were always alone. I wanted to walk over and start talking. I'd get sort of giddy. But I stopped myself. I was jealous because
you were good at everything. So I made you my rival. You've been… my goal. I had nothing, and I found a bond. I wanted to be strong
and cool like you. That's why I kept chasing after you. It was the opposite. In reality, I was the one
who was jealous of you. Because you had a strength
that I didn't. You were always walking
in front of me. Just like my late Big Brother. And…even today… I'll let you deal with Sasuke. That was my plan from the start! Entrusting it to you was
the right thing to do, after all. These are—! Naruto's memories. My dream… is to surpass the Hokage one day! And that's why I'm going to make everyone in the village
acknowledge me! I have to be ready… I'm gonna be called the Hokage,
someone that everyone acknowledges. There's no such thing as a shortcut! Quit messin' around,
I'll never run away! I will make it! Even if I stay a genin
for the rest of my life, I'll become the Hokage.
So I don't care! I never go back on my word.
That's my Ninja Way! I'm different from you. I'm absolutely gonna
become the Hokage. Becoming the Hokage
is my dream. I won't die…
until I become the Hokage! I'm gonna become the Hokage
to surpass all the previous ones! That's my dream, you idiot! The Hokage is someone
who endures the pain and takes the lead
in front of everyone. So a Hokage never walks over
his comrades' corpses. There is no shortcut
to becoming the Hokage! And there are no ways out
for the one who becomes Hokage! No way can a guy who can't even
save one friend become the Hokage. Isn't that right, Sasuke? Naruto... How far…have you—? No matter how powerful
you become, don't try to shoulder
everything alone. You share your father's dream,
don't you? Then don't ever forget… Becoming Hokage doesn't mean
people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you,
you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends! Big Brother… I see. Then… show me… Where are we? Don't tell me this is really
Heaven this time? Looks like we fell asleep
and slept until morning. We've failed to die again. Damn it! I still can't move! I was hoping to punch you hard and
make you finally open your eyes! W-What is it? We're messed up like this,
and you still wanna fight? Damn right! No matter
how many times it takes— I admit it. I've… lost. You idiot! This fight isn't about winning or losing! It's about punching a sulking friend,
to make him snap out of it! That's what it's about! The real match that I want,
comes after that! Hey, Naruto… I just acknowledged you. If I die here, the long cycle of destiny
the Sage of Six Paths mentioned will probably end as well. This is…a kind of revolution too. You can release the Infinite Tsukuyomi
after I'm dead, by transplanting my left eye
into Kakashi or someone else. I'll put an end to myself. By dying?
Don't think dying will settle this! If you're willing to die,
then live and help me instead. What I want to do is to make
all shinobi cooperate with each other. And that definitely includes you! Just because you want that
doesn't mean others will agree to it. Damn it! If you keep whining and sulking,
I'll slug you again! There's no guarantee
I won't stand against you again… Then I'll stop you again! Besides, I know you're not going to
do that kinda thing anymore. How can you be so sure? Don't make me repeat myself! Haven't you figured it out yet?! Now that I think about it… You were always pretty stupid too… THE UNISON SIGN
 Shut up, you loser. I'll start knowing your pain
and feelings too, Naruto.

 You never cut me off.

 You kept trying to get closer
to my feelings.

 You never stopping
calling me your friend.

 Even though I tried to sever
those feelings myself.

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"Naruto Uzumaki!"


 You stopped me, as a friend.


 NARUTO UZUMAKI!


 Tune in again!


 There they are! It figures they'd be here. Thanks, Sakura. Sakura… Never mind me… Stay quiet now. I need to concentrate. I'm sorry… Sorry? For what? For everything… You should be. Really...you… damn… idiot! He's finally back. Naruto… I've been thinking about
what you once said to me. When we were together, you wondered if it was
how having a brother would feel… Now, finally… I think I know what you meant. I felt how my mother, father,
and brother Itachi suffered. In that same way… Naruto… I'm sure I will start to feel your pain
and your emotions… You never cut me off. You always kept me in your thoughts. Naruto… SHIKAKU NARA
 INOICHI YAMANAKA
 You'd have been justified if
you'd come at me with hatred… Instead, you always called me
your friend. NEJI HYUGA
 And I tried to betray
even those feelings… As I explained,
it's the village policy. Only those authorized are allowed
at the interview. All others, please leave! What? Do you know
how far I traveled? Let us see him, just once! – Yeah!
– Yeah! It's the village policy… – Let us see Naruto!
– Let us see Naruto! Please don't push! It's dangerous. This should take care
of the successorship. It's a lot of paper. Yeah… Anyway, congratulations on becoming
the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi. Thank you. I just wonder…
Can I do this? You'll manage. After all, I did. I'll do my best. Excuse me. Status report: The Raikage's entourage and the Kazekage's entourage
have arrived. May I escort them to Naruto, too? You may. Further… I have a request. I see, Shikamaru. I understand your intentions. I want to get some experience
and improve my prospects too. All that's left is him. A ton of visitors are asking about him. Suddenly he's Mr. Popular. That's all right. He's not the type to get carried away. Hey! Gaara! Naruto… You…saved me yet again. And us. How's your wound? It's about what you'd guess. Can't say I'm in the best shape. Then, what'll you do about that arm? Oh, Grandma Tsunade said
something about harvesting cells from Hashirama,
the First Hokage, or whatever. She's gonna fuse them with mine,
I suppose? I don't really understand. Will it be as good as new? Yeah! I think. I'm here today so they can check. I see… Naruto is the Ninja World's sun!
His right hand's a precious companion! Losing it is devastation! Yay! So to get it back intact!
Use Hashirama's cells, in fact. It'll be as good as new, Jack! Yay! What's he up to? I really don't wanna say much. SEAL

 SEAL

I promised I wouldn't. SEAL

 I see. S-Sensei! Don't cry, Lee! Even if the bright days of youth end here,
there is still a future for me! The sun that shines bright! The sweltering heat! The red-hot days of
summer are here! O-Oww… Guy Sensei! I'm inspired!
What a brilliant way of thinking! Oh yuck… NINJA ACADEMY

 NINJA ACADEMY

Shikamaru… I hear you're
the Hokage's personal assistant. Well, yeah. I have to keep moving forward too. So why'd you ask me to
come to the Academy? Iruka Sensei? And Kakashi Sensei? More like Lord Hokage now. Huh?! When did that—?! You must have seen all the messages
that came in this morning. I had no idea… Don't worry about it. So what do I call you? Kakashi Hokage? Hokage Kakashi Teacher? Well, let's decide that later. Naruto! You never got to take
the Chunin Exam, right? No… Naruto Uzumaki! I, the Sixth Hokage, hereby grant you the rank of Jonin of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves! …is what I'd like to tell you. But there's something
you must complete before that. The educational materials
you'll be needing. You mean…? Yes, you have study. Study?! No way! No way, no way! If I'm gonna have to study,
I'll just stay a genin! Hold on, Naruto. There's no shortcut to
becoming the Hokage! Got it?! Naruto… I don't have to tell you that your skill as a shinobi
is second to none. However, if your goal is
to become the Hokage… You must learn how to stand
above others and lead them. You catch on fast,
and for most things, Shikamaru will support you
with his resourcefulness. Still, a minimum of learning
and knowledge is essential. We're rivals who both aim to
become Hokage, right?! THE HISTORY OF SHINOBI
VOLUME 1
 You really dug in, Naruto. Two more years,
and you can become a jonin. So long… Okay, let's call it a day and go grab some ramen. Yes! NINJA ACADEMY

 NINJA ACADEMY

Now what toppings should I choose? Now what toppings should I choose? Hey, don't get carried away. It's all thanks to you, Iruka Sensei. Huh? Do you remember that day? Hmm? That night, Sensei… You accepted me. It was the first time ever. That's why I'm here today. If no one acknowledged me
and I stayed the way I was… Maybe I would've resented the village
and everyone in it, and gone wild. But your words
that night changed me. But Naruto is different. He's… He's an exceptional student
and I acknowledge him! He is… Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf! Thank you, Iruka Sensei. That…that does it! Today, you can have
all the toppings you want! Awright! Sasuke… I'll be blunt. By rights, you should be
in prison right now. But we have heard your plea and all your actions up to now
have been pardoned. Breaking the jutsu
for the Infinite Tsukuyomi played a big part in the decision. As well as the fact that I happened
to become the Sixth Hokage, and that Naruto,
the key figure in ending the war, testified on your behalf. Don't forget that. And please don't get too reckless. Otherwise, I'll be held responsible. Understood. Thank you. Must you go? The artificial arm that
Lady Tsunade is creating from Lord Hashirama's cells will soon… I need time to understand
my feelings. How I should view the shinobi world,
this world. Perhaps I'll be able to see things
I couldn't see before. Things that can't be seen
unless I do this. Also, there's something
I'm worried about. What if I said…I'd go with you? This is a trip to atone for my sins. My sins have
nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with me…? Maybe next time. Thank you. I didn't think
you'd come to see me off. Here. You kept that thing? You sacrificed your arm to stop me. Thanks to you, I found salvation. Once, all we did was clash
with each other. But now, we share each other's pain. After all my travels
through the world, I came to the conclusion that this sharing of pain can perhaps be applied to something
much bigger than just us. But I can't do things like you. Things don't go that smoothly, as you and I know more than anyone… The bigger something is, the harder. I'm returning this. I'll hang on to it… …until our real match. This idea is almost a prayer. To keep enduring, no matter what,
until things come to pass. And for we who must endure, perhaps that's what it means… …to be a ninja. Long ago, there was a fox spirit.
This fox had nine tails. The fox was sealed inside
a shinobi's child and over time,
they became close friends. Then a new calamity occurred.
The Ten Tails was resurrected. But the child grew up to be a shinobi, and the fox spirit, the child, and the clans
joined to seal away the Ten Tails. This son of the Fourth Hokage into whom the fox spirit
was sealed, was named… Naruto Uzumaki.
 Hmm… Now this looks delicious.

 Well, it's the fish I caught.

 ‘Course it's gonna be good!

 I will make you strong.

 In times of danger,
I will risk my life to protect you.

 Brother Neji…

I knew you'd be here. I'd expect no less from
the Anbu Black Ops... under the direct command
of the Hokage. To think I wouldn't be able
to deceive you with that corpse... Now tell us everything.
What's this about? <i>Bonds


</i> You jerk!
Why did you betray us?! You shouldn't make too much
of a commotion here. Things will get troublesome,
you see. - You jerk!
- Naruto! Here...take this. It's yours, isn't it? Thank you. It was an order
from Danzo, right? Danzo has teamed up
with Orochimaru... and is attempting
to do something... You were chosen
to be the go-between... for Danzo and Orochimaru. What're they planning...? With Orochimaru, he's planning to... once again destroy the Leaf Village... Isn't that right? No, that's not-- I can tell right away that
your smile is a lie! And I can tell right away that
what you're saying is a lie! Now that you have found me... my mission is considered
a failure. I can't handle all of
you guys by myself... And...if you know that much... then there's no point
in hiding anything. You're exactly right. We're going to crush
the current Leaf Village. Say what...?! The real mission I was given was
to gain the favor of Orochimaru... and create an opportunity for
a collaboration... in order to crush the Leaf Village. Do you know
what you're saying?! - To do such a thing--
- That's not all. I also have the duty
of secretly sending... information about Orochimaru
to Lord Danzo... In other words, I have also been
entrusted with a mission as a spy. Keep going. Own up to everything
you're hiding. So basically what
you're saying is... while proposing the collaboration
with Orochimaru... you're trying to outflank him? You've been given such
a dangerous mission... Orochimaru will definitely betray us... once the Leaf Village
has been crushed. It's to make sure we've always
got the advantage. I get it... Danzo wants to make
the Leaf Village his own, huh? You made preparations
for that all by yourself... The information I wrote
in black ink transforms into small animals... and carries the information out
while protecting itself, you see. This ability of mine
was valued highly... and so I was selected
for this mission. Many people will die, once again... if things become turbulent
in the Leaf Village! Do you even know why
you're doing this?! No idea...
They're my orders, so... Sai, you... Let me tell you
one more thing... Sai is the name I was given
just for this mission... I'm nobody. I'm a tool for Lord Danzo. I don't exist. So no matter what you say
to me, it's pointless. Then... Then why... do you hold on to
that picture book with such care?! The two kids on the cover... are you and
your older brother, right? You're holding on to
that picture book with such care... because it's the only thing
that proves your existence, isn't it? You haven't been able to discard
your emotions as completely as you say. Even Shinobi can't completely
discard their emotions. As proof of that... when I handed
the picture book to you earlier... You said thanks and took it. You were relieved to get back... the picture book that can prove
your existence. Why does having this picture book
prove my own existence? The reason why you don't want
to part with that book... is that you can't forsake yourself
as a younger brother... Do you know why? It's because your bonds with
your older brother... were that important to you! You don't want to erase the bonds
you have with your older brother... Bonds... Sorry, but we had a look
inside the picture book. Only the picture in
the center-facing pages is unfinished. Sai... I also know that you're
from The Foundation. And I also know that
you received special training... from Danzo in order
to suppress your emotions. Special training...? It's the same as the evil practice... once conducted in the Village Hidden
in the Mist a.k.a. Blood Mist Village, in order to take away emotions. The Blood Mist Village ...
The Hidden Mist...? That's where Zabuza's from! Then... <i>A long time ago...</i> <i>in the Village Hidden in the Mist
<i>a.k.a. Blood Mist Village,</i> <i>there was an extremely difficult obstacle
<i>in order to become Ninja.</i> <i>You even know about
<i>that graduation exam...?</i> <i>That graduation exam?</i> <i>What's that graduation exam?</i> <i>Fellow students kill each other.</i> <i>Fellow comrades who all ate
<i>from the same bowl...</i> <i>make teams of two
<i>and fight each other...</i> <i>until one of them dies.</i> <i>Comrades who until that point
<i>would help each other,</i> <i>talk about their dreams
<i>and compete with each other...</i> Looking at the flow
of the picture book, it appears you're
defeating enemies... and taking away
their weapons and armor... On the facing pages at the center... you will end up fighting
your older brother... You killed your older brother-- No! I was planning on
giving this to him. But when I was just about finished
with the picture book, he... He... died from sickness. What do you mean...you don't feel
anything or have any emotions? I mean just what I said. Even so... If you have a brother,
you should be able to imagine... what it would be like
to lose him, right? Yeah, well...you could say that... My brother's dead, after all. Then all the more... I wonder if I should've
looked like that. What're you trying to say? Well... I didn't know what kind
of look to make when my brother died... In The Foundation, there were
many children of broken families... brought about by battle. He was one of those children. I became close with him,
like a brother. We weren't related by blood... But he often said nice things
about my drawings. In this picture book... what I wanted to show him
most of all... was what were supposed to be the final
pictures on the facing pages. But after he died... I couldn't remember
what I was going to draw. Unfortunately Sai... I'll be having my clone
stand guard over you here. All right! Now it's back to square one... We're going to save Sasuke! I wouldn't bother. I... met Sasuke. Sasuke always has Orochimaru
with him. That is to say, you'll have to fight
Orochimaru once again. You'll end up being
chopped up into pieces... and turned into a test subject
if you pursue reckssly. And... And what?! Sasuke said he doesn't care
about you... Sakura said you think of Sasuke like
a brother. And yet... For a guy like that, why...? Why are you trying
to get him back... going so far as to oppose
Orochimaru and put your life at risk? Why is that?
When nobody's ordering you to do so? I used to really hate Sasuke. Even though, like me,
he didn't have a family... he was elite and
I was always at the bottom. But it was actually fun
being with him. He... He's the person
who acknowledged me... more than anyone else. Sasuke... is my friend. It's a special bond
I was finally able to make. A bond. Even so... Even so, with Orochimaru
as your opponent... It doesn't matter
who the opponent is! If my arms get torn off,
I'll kick him down. If my legs get torn off,
I'll bite him down. If my head gets torn off,
I'll stare him down. If my eyes get torn out,
I'll curse him in my grave! Even if I get chopped up
into pieces... I'll take Sasuke back
from Orochimaru! Damn it,
there are so many rooms! Sasuke is back here somewhere... Let's split up here
and search for him. But Captain, what if
we stir up a hornet's nest...? It'll be okay. The seeds will generally respond
if you build up your Chakra, so I should be able to rush on in. I get it. Roger! Okay, we're ready, huh?
Let's make our move. Move out! Next time:
"Something Important..." I hear it's true. That boy, huh? Look, isn't that the boy? He gives me the creeps. Hey, don't play with him. You don't know what he'll do. Is that right? Man, that looks good! Pops, give me an order of fried rice
and dumplings! Got it! Coming right up! Dumplings for me! Gotcha! What a weird kid. He's the kid… Did you hear the rumors that
the Fourth died because of him? Oh… I'm home… Oww... Oh! Wow! Wow! Wh-Who are you? Just an old man passing through. Here, gramps, eat this. Oh, thank you. Oh, this looks so good. Well, I caught it. So of course,
it's gonna taste good! Is that so? H-Hot! Look at those stars. Each one of those stars
is like our world's sun. What do you think?
The sheer amount is incredible, eh? The sun? That giant thing that
shines in the sky during the day? Yes. This world is boundless. Yeah? You sure know a lot, gramps! Compared to the vastness of the world,
man's existence is very insignificant. The things that insignificant humans
fret about are petty indeed. No kidding. The world is big, huh. It goes on and on… Do you want some
mushroom soup, gramps? Are you sure
you can spare me some? Sure! You tell great stories, gramps! I see! Are you sure these mushrooms
are safe? Won't know until we eat ‘em! He's right…
Compared to the world, I'm just… I'm so small, whatever I do… But I'm me. That's who I am! All right, that will do for today. No, Father… I can still continue! Neji… You mustn't push yourself too hard. But considering your age,
you've certainly gotten strong. Father… Thank you for sparring with me. Oh, Father… I have heard that your older brother
has a child like me. Yes… A girl, one year younger than you. A girl… We will be going to a celebration
tomorrow for her third birthday. I wonder what she's like… Father, it's snowing! The first snow… It's going to turn into
a heavy snowfall. Look at all the snow! All right, we're off. Dear, please... Look after Neji. Among the Hyuga, he is the one with
the most potential. I shall protect him. HYUGA

 HYUGA

Lady Hinata... Congratulations
on your third birthday. Lady Hinata… ...is a cute child. Neji... It is your destiny to protect her, and to protect
the Hyuga bloodline. The Hyuga…bloodline? Father! Neji is very strong. When we were young— Neji lives for Lady Hinata's sake. That is the Hyuga destiny. All right, that will do for today. Neji, you are strong indeed. Hinata, you have a ways to go. No, my father's daily lessons are… I…don't like… to practice taijutsu. What are you saying? You are the important successor
of the Hyuga clan. You must be more positive
and confident. I wish I could switch with you,
Big Brother Neji… You are very strong, after all. No, you must never say
such a thing. I will make you strong! When you are in danger,
I will give my life to protect you! Brother Neji! Lady Hinata, it's snowing! I had a snowball fight with my father
this morning, and I hit him twice! LANTERN FOR THE DECEASED
 Hizashi! He's only four… It's such a pity… Big Brother Neji… LANTERN FOR THE DECEASED
 What are you doing?! What're you doing here? If you keep crying,
how am I supposed to find out? I…I… Where's your house? Oh well, come on. Let's go. HYUGA

 HYUGA

You live in a big house like this, and you're crying? I don't have anyone,
but I never cry. Never! Later! Hinata! You are the important heir
to the Main Family! What do you think you're doing?! I… For your sake, and for the sake
of the Main Family, many people have made
the ultimate sacrifice. It's about time you learned
about these things. You must surpass me.

 That's impossible!

 You're a lot like me.
You have the potential.

 Then I will surpass you!

 Sakura, aren't your bangs
getting in the way?

 You should just cut them!

 If you say things like that,
Sakura will start hating you!

 Next time on Naruto Shippuden:
"SASUKE - SAKURA"


 Tune in again!

For a guy like him,
why are you...? Why are you trying
to get him back... going so far as to oppose Orochimaru
and put your life at risk? Why is that? When nobody's ordering
you to do so? Sasuke... is my friend. It's a special bond
I was finally able to make. A bond. Even so... Even so, with Orochimaru
as your opponent... It doesn't matter
who the opponent is! If my arms get torn off,
I'll kick him down. If my legs get torn off,
I'll bite him down. If my head gets torn off,
I'll stare him down. If my eyes get torn out,
I'll curse him in my grave! Even if I get chopped up
into pieces... I'll take Sasuke back
from Orochimaru! <i>Something Important...


</i> We'll go after
I create the guard. I thought we'd completely
given our pursuers the slip... I guess I should say... I'd expect no less from
Lord Orochimaru's test subject... Kabuto...! You're sure persistent! Sai... Judging from your condition,
it appears you've been captured. Don't interfere. If you do... I won't go easy on you! It's futile. We won't
know that until we try! - We won't let you interfere!
- We won't let you interfere! You've got it wrong. I'm not talking about that. Aha...! This is impressive... <i>I guess with three against one,
<i>the odds are against me, huh?</i> <i>And it appears they've got luck
<i>on their side as well...</i> I'll believe you... since it doesn't appear
you've betrayed us. Man, it's truly pathetic
watching you guys. You in particular, Naruto. Watching you... What I mean is, it's futile even
if you were able to beat me... People change... Sasuke isn't
the old Sasuke anymore. Wha--?! What's the idea...? <i>I used to really hate Sasuke.</i> <i>But it was actually fun
<i>being with him.</i> <i>He's...</i> <i>He's the person who acknowledged me
<i>more than anyone else.</i> <i>Sasuke is my friend.</i> <i>It's a special bond
<i>I was finally able to make.</i> Your mission
was supposed to be... to become the liaison for Danzo
and Lord Orochimaru. People change... Then the same goes for me. What?! But there are things
that don't change... Sai... You... Bonds... I want to see for myself... Sai... Sai... Keep a hold on him... Sai... What the heck
are you thinking? Why are you so hung up
on your bonds with Sasuke... and what are those bonds? I want to know... From your viewpoint, it seems I can't erase my bond
with my older brother... <i>The reason why you don't want
<i>to part with that book...</i> <i>is that you can't forsake yourself
<i>as a younger brother...</i> <i>It's because your bonds with
<i>your older brother...</i> <i>were that important to you!</i> <i>You don't want to erase the bonds
<i>you have with your older brother.</i> <i>Bonds...</i> If it's something
that important to me, then I might understand
if I see your bonds with Sasuke. I just thought that way. What's so funny?! You guys don't know
the real Sasuke... Where's Sasuke? Answer me. He's probably done
with his training right about now... and is in a room deeper
inside the hideout. It's true that Sasuke was
training with Orochimaru. I don't think what
he said just now is a lie. All right!
Then let's get right to it-- However... Where exactly is
this room deeper inside...? I don't know, either. There are several rooms
scattered about in here. A room deeper inside doesn't
mean just one or two rooms... In that case! We just have to search
every single one of them! You're right. You might find it
if you search at random. However... You could stir up
a serpent's nest. That's also where Lord Orochimaru's
private room is, you see. Thanks for speaking honestly. No need to thank me. Are you saying the tables
will be turned on us...? Yeah. You jerk! That's something we won't know
until we try. Let's go. We won't know
until we try...huh? Truly...pathetic... Now we're going to split up
and search for Sasuke. Sakura and I on one team. Naruto and Sai on the other. Right! Got it. If something comes up,
build up your Chakra. I'll rush in right away
just with that. <i>Sasuke...</i> All right! Let's go! <i>Hang on, Sasuke!</i> <i>I'm coming now!</i> <i>Here.</i> <i>Wh-What's with that...look...
<i>you...total...loser...</i> <i>You jerk! What're you trying
<i>to look good for, you idiot?!</i> <i>Sakura's this worried about...</i> <i>Naruto.</i> <i>I want to fight you...</i> <i>For me, you've become...</i> <i>my closest friend.</i> <i>Sasuke...!</i> <i>Sakura...</i> <i>Thanks...</i> <i>Sasuke...</i> Naruto! Right! It looks like nobody's here. This isn't the place. Not here, either! He's not here, either. He's not here! He's not here. Damn it! <i>Sasuke...</i> <i>Where are you?!</i> <i>Where are you?!</i> <i>We've...finally made it this far!</i> <i>Where are you?!</i> <i>Sasuke...!</i> Sasuke! Naruto, we're split up
into two teams. You should rest a little... Shut up! I can't be resting
at a time like this. We're almost to Sasuke... Man, you're certainly talkative,
you lose your head... and you have no manners. Mind your own business! You really resemble him. Resemble who? My older brother. Next time:
"The Picture Book's Story"

﻿1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,430
This isn't the place. <i>Where are you?</i> <i>We've...finally made it this far!</i> Sasuke! It seems... they still haven't been able
to find him... This hideout is rather large,
after all. I think it'll be
a struggle for them. It'd be a different story
if they had a detailed map... But unfortunately,
it's inside my head. Did you think if you said that, I'd ask you to show me
the way? My mission is to stand guard
over you here... I've no intention of doing
something so risky... as to take you inside your base. That's too bad... He's not in here, either. This is the last room
on this floor. Let's go to the next floor. Right... Naruto...! We're split up
into two search teams. You should stay calm
and rest a little... Shut up...! I can't be resting! We're so close...to Sasuke... <i>Damn it...!</i> <i>The damage I took when I morphed
<i>into the Nine-Tails still hasn't...</i> He's not in here, either... Sakura...
You're getting too impatient... This is the inside
of Orochimaru's hideout... It's possible that traps
have been set. If we get too impatient,
he might find out that we're here. I know that! But! Sasuke is...! Sakura! What about Naruto...? Not yet. But it's only a matter of time
before we find Sasuke... Act with caution! I will... <i>The Picture Book's Story


</i> It seems you're awake... Sai? Boy...you really resemble him. My older brother... He was talkative and
he would lose his head... He had no manners...
and his equipment was-- Well, never mind... But yeah...like you, he went all-out with
everything he did. When I look at you, I kind of remember him... Sai? Sai...! Hey, Sai! What's the matter? I remembered...
I remembered...! You mean... This is what I wanted
to show him. The picture of our dreams... Now then...Sai... which side are you going
to take? Striking Shadow Snake! Just as I thought. It seems
you're taking that side, huh...? Sai or whatever... I'll stop him here. Sai, you go find Sasuke. Hurry! Okay... I'll find Sasuke...
and save him! So you came to take back
Sasuke, huh...? Your persistence is impressive,
but will it really be that easy? It doesn't make any difference that
you're one of the Legendary Sannin like the Pervy Sage and
Grandma Tsunade! I'll defeat you...
and take Sasuke back! He's not here, either... Naruto's Chakra... It appears something
has happened... Let's go! Right! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Striking Shadow Snake! Rasengan! What happened to all
your energy from earlier? Your power...
The power of the Nine-Tails... There must be more to it
than this, right? <i>You're the one
<i>who hurt Sakura, Naruto.</i> <i>You'll end up tormenting yourself
<i>if you rely on the power...</i> <i>of the Nine-Tails from here on.</i> <i>And it could turn into a power
<i>that hurts your friends.</i> <i>Like what happened this time.</i> <i>If you want to save Sasuke,
<i>do it with your own power.</i> <i>If you want to see Sasuke...</i> <i>do it with your own eyes,
<i>not the Nine-Tails'.</i> <i>And if you want
<i>to protect Sakura...</i> <i>do it with your own power,
<i>not the Nine-Tails'!</i> Show me all you've got. Striking Shadow Snake! Orochimaru again, huh...? <i>Naruto is stalling Orochimaru...</i> <i>And I'm sure the Captain
<i>and Sakura...</i> <i>have gone to back up Naruto...</i> Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll! Naruto... I'll still let you live... Please dispose of as many members
of the Akatsuki as you can, okay? Wh-What?! More importantly,
I've got business with Sai... So I'll be leaving now. Where's Sai? Sai's looking for Sasuke! We have to do something
before Orochimaru finds him! I'll have to use up all of
my Chakra, but I'll try searching with
my Multiple Shadow Clone... Captain Yamato and Sakura,
you guys search that side. What's this...? He...was able to remember... He said that's the picture of dreams
he wanted to show his older brother. They're both smiling... Yeah... He smiled for real for
the first time when he drew that... Smiled from the bottom of his heart. Wh-What's this...?! What's the matter? It was in Sai's bag... This is an assassination list
that has... an Anbu Black Ops member's
own targets recorded... It's called a Bingo Book. An assassination list...? What are these "X" marks? In all likelihood, they're marks indicating targets
that have already been eliminated... Why does Sai have such a thing...? Look at this... Th-This is...! Why is Sasuke's face...
in Sai's assassination list...? Why is Sasuke's face
on Sai's assassination list...? Then Sai's real mission was
to assassinate Sasuke?! It can't be... He promised me that
he would save Sasuke! I'm sorry to say this,
but it could all be an act. But...! What was that noise?! Can it be that Sai...! No...! Let's hurry!
Sai's location is not that far! Next time: "Reunion" They're both smiling... Yeah... He smiled for real for
the first time when he drew that. Smiled from the bottom of his heart. Wh-What's this...?! Reunion


 It was in Sai's bag... This is an assassination list
that has... an Anbu Black Ops member's
own targets recorded... It's called a Bingo Book. An assassination list...? What are these "X" marks? In all likelihood, they're marks indicating targets
that have already been eliminated. Why does Sai have such a thing? Look at this... Th-This is...! Sasuke...
Why does Sai...! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll. There's no "X" mark on this yet... I get it...
So that's what this is about? What do you mean?! Sai... His mission wasn't to be a go-between
for Orochimaru and Danzo. Sai's true classified mission... was to assassinate Sasuke. That could never be! After all, he said earlier that
he was going to save Sasuke... And he really smiled from
the bottom of his heart... This is what I wanted
 to show him. The picture of our dreams... Unlike before, he's now... What if that was all... an act in order
to forestall you, Naruto? I'm a tool for Lord Danzo.
I don't exist. So no matter what you say to me,
it's pointless... The owner of this Bingo Book... could indeed be capable
of something like that. Look at this... This man in the book
next to Sasuke... He's a Jonin from
the Hidden Mist... and the man who expressed
a hard-line stance against the Leaf. Sai...defeated him, huh...? He couldn't have been
an easy opponent to defeat... The fact that he eliminated him
means that in all likelihood, he must have resorted
to every possible means. An act in order
to forestall someone... was probably all in
a day's work for him. A smile is used
to carry out a goal... You tricked me with
your fake smile earlier. So that's how you use
a fake smile, huh...? I'll remember that. How can you grin like that
after getting punched?! A smile is the best way
to get through a tough situation. Even if it's a fake smile. Surprisingly enough,
everyone gets fooled... It said that in a book... It's quite clear by looking
at each of the people listed... in this Bingo Book... Sai was assigned to the disposal
of people dangerous to the Leaf... And Sasuke is also
one such dangerous person. Danzo's goal... was to bury Orochimaru's new flesh...
to bury Sasuke... In order to do that, Sai attempted
to approach Orochimaru... He didn't betray the Leaf.
It was for the sake of the Leaf. That's exactly what one from
a hard-line military faction would think up. There's no point in going on
about that here... It doesn't matter
what Sai was ordered to do... or what that Danzo guy's
thinking about. Meeting up with Sai
as quickly as possible... and saving Sasuke
is what's important! It's indeed as Naruto says. I felt Sai's Chakra earlier.
We need to go quickly. Right! Got it! If Sai is after Sasuke... then I'll stop him,
no matter what! Who's there? You found me out, huh...? But...I've already made
the first move. What is your objective? Lord Danzo's objective is
to bury you... I'm going to... Sai! ...take you back to the Leaf! Although at the beginning, I came here with the intention
of killing you... He's the person who acknowledged me
more than anyone else. Naruto...thinks of Sasuke
like a brother. I'll do whatever it takes
to save him. I'll even team up with you. Even if I get chopped up
into pieces, I'll take Sasuke back
from Orochimaru! Sasuke is my friend. It's a special bond
I was finally able to make... I want to protect
his bond with you, the one he's desperately trying to
draw closer to. Bond... You interrupted my sleep
for something like that...? What was that?! It's Sai's Chakra. That way, right? What was that...? Sasuke, huh...? That kid wakes up in
a bad mood, you see... Impressive... To think he'd break free
from my Jutsu by force... I found him! Sakura! You!
What're you really after?! How many times do you have
to betray us until you're satisfied...? Sakura, huh? That voice... Sa...su...ke... Sasuke... Naruto, huh...? So even you were here, huh? Then is Kakashi also with you? Sorry, it's not Kakashi...
I'm his substitute. Team Kakashi will now be taking you
back to the Leaf. Team Kakashi, huh? Sai! I knew it! So he's my replacement, huh...? Some soft one has once again
joined up. He said he wanted to protect
the bond... between Naruto and me, but... Sai... I thought your mission
was to kill Sasuke. My classified mission was indeed
the assassination of Sasuke... But I've had enough of orders... I now want to act on
my own beliefs. I think Naruto will get me
to remember... my past emotions. I kind of get the feeling... it's something
very important to me. I don't know you very well. But there must be some kind
of reason why Naruto and Sakura... have pursued you so desperately. They don't want to sever
their bonds with you... They're giving it their all
to secure those bonds. I still don't understand it
all that clearly... But Sasuke...
you should understand. Yeah... I did understand. That's why I severed the bonds. Knock it off! That's just what I want! Why? I haven't narrowed the gap at all
since back then. What's up with this difference? You're weak. You're weak... because you don't have enough... hatred. I have different bonds... Bonds of hatred...
with my older brother. You've severed our bonds? If that's what you say, then why didn't you kill me
back then?! You think that would sever it,
Sasuke?! It's not that I couldn't sever
the bond shared with you. It's just that your life
was spared back then... because of my passing whim. And because of my passing whim,
you will now lose your life. Next Time:
"The Power of Uchiha"


 The Power of Uchiha


 I have different bonds... Bonds of hatred with
my older brother... Numerous bonds... mislead oneself... and weaken
the most important desires... and cherished memories. Have you finally opened
your eyes...Sasuke?! Shut up. You don't even have parents
or siblings... What do you know about me?! You've been alone from the start! What do you know
about me?! Huh?! It's having the bond
that makes it painful! You've no idea what it's like...
to lose that! You're right. I don't know about having
real parents or siblings... If that's the case, then why...? Why, Naruto...? Why do you go so far for me...? To me, it's a bond...I've finally
been able to establish. That's why I'll stop you! Why didn't you... I can't turn back... Then I'll just break
that bond! Why didn't you kill me
back then?! You think that could
break our bond, Sasuke?! Naruto... The reason's simple... It's not that I couldn't break
the bond with you... You're one... who might be able to use the same
Mangekyo Sharingan as mine... However, there's a condition. You must kill... your closest friend. That's...! It was just irritating to me. Obtaining power based on
the method he told me. What do you mean?! It's not necessary
to explain that to you. What I can say to you is... Back then... Chidori! Rasengan! - Rasengan!
- Chidori! Naruto... I... Back then... You're only alive
because of my passing whim. He's fast! When did he...? Come to think of it, wasn't it your dream
to become the Hokage...? If you had the time
to be chasing after me, you should've spent that time
training or something. Right, Naruto? S-Sasuke...! And so this time around... you'll lose your life... because of my passing whim. No way can a guy who can't
even save one friend... become the Hokage. Isn't that right, Sasuke? Sasuke! That manner of defense... was correct. All right! Chidori Stream! He's unleashing Chidori
from his entire body...! Sorry, Naruto... You'll have to wait a while... Next time, I promise... I won't be a burden. I'll stop Sasuke... with my own power! Those eyes.
This guy's bad news. Captain Yamato! That manner of defense... was a mistake. This Snake Sword of mine
is somewhat special, you see. It's impossible to guard. My body is getting numb... This is... Is he sending a Chidori
through the blade...? I get it... It paralyzes you
with numbness after cutting... on top of increasing the cutting quality
to the extreme... It appears...
things have gotten interesting. Now's your chance, Naruto... Show him...our... powers. What's the matter...? Why do you hesitate...? You need my power, don't you? Now then... Who do you want to kill...? Don't...come out anymore! What're you afraid of? Shut up...! I don't need anything like
your power anymore! Who was the one
who had the nerve... to ask for my help
at every opportunity? You should know that you can't
do anything on your own. Break the Seal completely! I'll grant you all of my powers
if you do. Get lost! You... I see...
So you're an Uchiha... My, how you've grown... What're you doing here...? I can see it now... So this is
your unknown power, huh...? Who would've thought... you'd have something like this
inside of you... To think you'd become able
to see me within Naruto... That dreadful Sharingan... So that's the power of
the cursed clan, huh? It seems this isn't the first time
you've seen the Sharingan. Then... you must be
the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...? That vision, and Chakra
more ominous than mine... It's just like... the Madara Uchiha
from olden times... Uchiha... Hell if I know...that person. I never thought... you would go so far as
to suppress my power... This might be the end... But let me tell you...one thing... Don't...kill...Naruto... You'll... regret...it... Wood Style: Domed Wall! Sasuke... Looks like it's meaningless... to try and convince
Sasuke further than this. Captain Yamato... We can't let a Shinobi
who left the village... roam free forever, you see. I really didn't want to take
any rough measures... because of you two watching, but... What do you intend to do? We'll bring him into the Leaf
with any means we can. Sorry, but I'm going to go
all out from here. Next time: "Title"


 Why...? Why don't you get it?! Soon, Orochimaru's going
to take your body! If it happens, it happens... You're still a kid, Naruto. Revenge is everything to me. If I can carry out my revenge, it's no concern of mine
what happens to me, or to this world. Put simply, neither I nor Orochimaru
can defeat Itachi right now. But if I can obtain the power
to accomplish that by giving my body to Orochimaru, then I'll give him as much of
this life of mine as he wants. Title


 The talking's over. Naruto and Sakura... I didn't want to do anything rough
in front of you guys... but I'm going to get serious now. Captain Yamato! What do you mean, serious...? I can't just let those who left the village in the same way
as Orochimaru run loose. So I'll do whatever I have to do
to haul Sasuke back to the Hidden Leaf. The Hidden Leaf, huh...? I've had enough of you guys... It's over. Orochimaru... Don't bother with that Jutsu, Sasuke. Let go of me... Hey-hey... Don't talk to
Lord Orochimaru like that... I've got no reason to stop. You know what the Akatsuki
are up to, don't you? We want these guys from
the Hidden Leaf to take care of the Akatsuki for us. As many of them as possible... Your revenge won't turn out well if the other Akatsuki
get in the way, right? That's a pathetic reason. It should increase your chances of revenge,
even if only by one percent... Isn't that right? Let's go. Once again... Once again...I couldn't stop him... I'm...totally weak... Crying... Crying won't bring Sasuke back home! I'm here! I'll get stronger with you! We've got...
close to six months left, right? It goes without saying that three
are better than two. Besides, I'm pretty strong myself. Thanks... Now then... This is just the beginning... I see... Hidden Leaf Hospital What did you say?! Naruto and the others fought Sasuke?! Yes... But, their original mission was to... Yes, their mission was to capture
the spy Sasori sent to Orochimaru and bring him back to the Hidden Leaf, and to get information about Orochimaru
and Sasuke as well. But Sasori's spy, Kabuto Yakushi, already had Sasori's Jutsu
broken by Orochimaru. And it seems Orochimaru tried to use
this opportunity to kill Sasori, not knowing that the real Sasori
was already dead... Naruto made contact with Orochimaru, became unable to
control his emotions... and ran amuck. Naruto eventually
released his fourth tail... and went wild. Orochimaru did battle
with the Nine-Tails Naruto. Even he probably reached his limit... Stabilize




It seems he tried to disappear while Yamato was attempting
to control Naruto. However, Yamato's clone secretly
pursued Orochimaru. Finally, they found Orochimaru's hideout
and made their way in. Then it seems they encountered Sasuke
and a battle ensued. So...then what happened? It seems Sasuke has become
significantly more powerful... I hear Naruto didn't stand
a chance against him... I see... Well, don't get so depressed. It appears Naruto wasn't able
to show his full power because of damage from
the Nine-Tails Cloak. And... No. I'm not all that depressed,
you know. I figured Sasuke would be stronger
at this point in time... And... Now Naruto will be more fired up
for future training after having realized the difference
between Sasuke and himself. Right? Right. Well, I guess we should be happy
they made it back safe. It's fortunate that Naruto
was able to make it back safely. However, although unexpected situations
are an inevitable part of missions... I never thought he would end up
doing battle with Orochimaru... And here, it's best to keep Naruto
in the village because things like this
end up happening... I don't think that hard-head
would depart from his opinions so easily. So? We aren't giving up! Okay, I will issue
your next mission immediately. Stand by at home until I contact you! Right! Hey, Sakura.
Let's go on a date together. Have you forgotten what Lady Tsunade
said just now? Huh?! What'd she say again? We're supposed to stand by at home until Team Kakashi's next mission
has been determined, right?! What? She won't find out if
we just go out for a little while! Why don't you go by yourself
if you want to go out on a date? I won't be able to
go on a date by myself. By the way, what about Sai's activity? Yes. You were right
to be concerned, Lady Tsunade. Danzo gave him a special mission. A special mission?! I knew it... It seems Sai was put in charge
of undercover work, dealing with potential risks
to the Hidden Leaf while carrying out his mission as an Anbu Black Ops member
under Danzo's direction. Sai's purpose for joining us in
Team Kakashi was to bury Sasuke, who is to become the new vessel
for Orochimaru, the individual of most concern
to the Hidden Leaf. What?! I figured he was a crafty guy... As would be expected of the leader
of a hard-line military faction, his actions are strong-armed. But our protective feelings
for the Hidden Leaf are the same, huh...? Are you talking about Danzo? Yes, I am... Then could you hold off on
your conclusions until you see this? What's this? Danzo gave this to Sai as
a gift for Orochimaru in order for the contact with Orochimaru
to proceed smoothly. Wh-What's this?! It's a list of Anbu Black Ops members! Damn it! That jerk, Danzo! How did he get the list from
the classified files...? Um...Lady Tsunade... Shizune! Tighten security at
the classified files storehouse and change the deciphering codes
for the files. Quickly! Y-Yes ma'am! Right now! Damn it! That sly old dog... He's always the crafty one! At a time when the outside
of the village is in an uproar with Orochimaru
and the Akatsuki... I never thought I'd have to be concerned
about trouble inside  the village... Now I'll be forced to consider Sai's
earlier proposal with caution. In that case... I never thought you'd fail
the special mission... That's very unlike you... I have a favor to ask. A favor, you say? Yes. Could you keep me in Team Kakashi
under this name for a while? That smile on his face... I've already taken that up
with Tsunade. But you understand that emotions
create hate, don't you, Sai? And hate creates battles. Bonds of hatred with
my older brother... That might be so. But... He's the person who acknowledged
me more than anyone else. Sasuke is my friend. It's a special bond
I was finally able to make. Comrade Don't you know
what the word comrade is? Of course, I do.
What of it? Hey! Sai! We're having a meeting about
our next mission! Hurry up, man! Right, I'm coming. I heard about everything from Yamato. And I heard about Sasuke, too. We don't have time. And yet, we can't bring Sasuke back
with our power right now. The speed of Sasuke's development
was extraordinary. According to Lady Tsunade, there's a possibility they're using
Forbidden Jutsu and perhaps drugs. Then we just have to rapidly
get more powerful. But how do we do that...? Well, I wasn't just lying here
not thinking about anything. Next time: "Nightmare"


 A dream, huh...? What was that...all about...? Hidden Leaf Library Nightmare


 In order to have others quickly
understand you... first you must get closer
to their spirits. For example, when calling people
by their names, it is impersonal to call people
using "san" or "kun." You will never get closer
to them like that. You might first try taking the plunge and call people by
their first name only... or try using a nickname or
term of endearment. If you do that, others will feel much
more familiar about you... as a special person... I get it... Oh, found it. What...? Isn't that Sai? Make-Out Paradise is... Did you come looking for a book
of paintings or something? Sakura... So, you read books, huh...? Well...a little bit. So even Sai has quite
a human side to him, huh...? Naruto and I were just on our way to visit Kakashi Sensei
in the hospital... Why don't you come with us? Kakashi...Sensei... You're on Team Kakashi too,
so you should meet him... Revenge is everything to me. If I can carry out my revenge, it's no concern of mine what
happens to me, or to this world. But if I can obtain the power
to accomplish that by giving my body to Orochimaru, then I'll give him as much of
this life of mine as he wants. I can see it now... So this is your unknown power, huh...? Who would've thought... you'd have something like
this inside of you... Why did I have that dream...? Naruto! What? Sai's with you, too? I bumped into him at the library. Oh...and here I was working out
my plan to walk with you, just the two of us,
like we were on a date! If you've got the time to be
doing that, you should be studying up
on Ninjutsu or something! Study, huh...? How can you guys even go to
a stuffy place like that? You should train your mind a little
and not just your body. You're really an idiot, after all. I knew it... Sakura is calling
Naruto only by his first name... That's harsh, Sakura. N-Naruto, S-Sakura... Could you guys include me
in the conversation, too? Oh! Well, I read in a book... about how to open up to
other people right away... And in the book, it said to call people
by their first names only and to use nicknames and
terms of endearment... It said if I did that there would
be a sense of friendliness and we'd be able
to get along right away. Oh, so you're concerned
about stuff like that, huh? So that's what you were doing
in the library... Yeah. And...I was thinking about nicknames and terms of endearment
for you guys... But I couldn't really come up
with anything good... So I'll just call you guys by
just your first names for now... I can't believe Sai would think
so seriously about us... You don't need to think about stuff
like that. It just happens naturally! For nicknames or terms
of endearment, you should just say that
person's character trait. For example,
if you're talking about Naruto... Idiot Naruto! Or moron Naruto!
Or something. Sakura, you're taking things
too far with that. I get it...A person's character trait... I can't believe this is Sai... He's totally different from
when I first met him... Huh...? You don't have to stare
at me like that... Thank you. I've got
the hang of it now... Ugly. Sai, you're really taking things
too far with that! Huh? What do you mean? Sakura, why'd you have to
hit me, too...? I see... You're the new team member. Sai, was it? Nice to meet you. Right. Sakura, come here for a second. Those two are hurt...
Did they fight or something? It'd be no stretch of the imagination
with someone hot-tempered like Naruto... N-No, nothing happened at all...
We're all getting along fine! Oh, I see...Then I guess it's okay. This is Kakashi Hatake, the one rumored about
in the Anbu Black Ops Training Division. Naruto... Yeah... Kakashi Sensei...
About our previous mission... I heard about everything
from Yamato. About Sasuke, too... We don't have time... At this rate, he'll soon be... But I can't bring Sasuke back
with the power I have now... He's gotten too powerful... Well then, you just have to get
more powerful, right? But...the speed of Sasuke's development
was extraordinary even in my eyes. When I asked Lady Tsunade, she said there's a possibility
they're using Forbidden Jutsu and perhaps drugs in his training... And they've got Kabuto with them, so... There's probably no way to find out,
in a book like this, how people who conduct
experiments on humans think... Then we just have to
rapidly get more powerful. But how do we do that? Did you think I was just lying here
not thinking about anything? I thought about that the whole time. And...I figured it out. However, this approach is
suited for Naruto... Or...rather I should say it's an approach
only Naruto can do. In that training... in a sense you might
just exceed me, Naruto. I'll...exceed you, Kakashi Sensei? That's right. I'll be with you the whole time
on this training. And it will be a different type of training... Wh-What're we going to do...? We're going to create a Ninjutsu
of ultimate strength just for you. In other words, you're going to learn a new Ninjutsu
that will exceed the Rasengan. However, the acquisition
of such a power will require an enormous amount
of time and effort. You can't get strong instantly
after just a few days like the hero in a novel. And it's completely different from being carefully taught
and learning a Jutsu like the Rasengan that
has already been created. An enormous amount of time... But I just said we don't have time!
Sasuke will be... What I'm saying is, I figured out a way
to do it in a short amount of time. How do we do it...? Well... How're you doing, Kakashi? Asuma Sensei, you could
at least knock! Hello. Why it's Naruto and Sakura... Is your mission already... You're that guy from back then... Wh-Who is he...? Why is all of this happening
so suddenly today...? Relax. First, smile... Hello. Thanks...for the report. I'll be going now. The Akatsuki activity is finally
getting into full swing. It's only a matter of time before they start churning things
up around the Leaf. Indeed, this is a significant crisis. But that's also our chance
to attack them. We can't just sit around anymore. Hidden Leaf Hospital Oh, so that's what was going on. I buy that. My name's Sai.
Please just call me by my first name. Hey, he's pretty cute...
He kind of resembles Sasuke, too. On the outside.
But he's quite different on the inside. He can't really read the mood
of a room, you see. I heard about Sasuke from
Lady Tsunade. I'll help you guys out in the future
should something happen. I'm finished with those troublesome
Chunin Exams, after all. You missed out on becoming
a Chunin again, huh? Yeah... Well, I guess that was the least
of your problems, huh...? What're you doing here
with the whole gang in town? This isn't a break room, you know. That's right... You guys go on ahead to "Barbe-Q." You guys from Team Kakashi
should go too if you want. Yay! Barbeque! I second that! I'll sit next to Sai! I need to talk to Kakashi alone
about a few things. The barbeque is on me, okay? Hey, just a minute! Listen! Listen! What about the rest of the discussion
about my training?! That's right...Hmm... Well, we'll get to that later. Later?! I'm really curious about it! Well, we can't start training while
I'm still in the hospital. Don't be so impatient. What took you so long, Sakura? What? Where's Shikamaru? He said he was going home because he has to get some horns
for medicinal use with his father. No kidding? He always shows up
for end-of-mission parties... This is a first for him... She isn't taking my advice... All right! I'll eat Shikamaru's share! Hey, Choji! We have to introduce ourselves
to Sai before we eat. Oh, oh...right. It appears things have started
getting turbulent outside the land... I knew it... As long as their objective
is the Tailed Beasts, it's a foregone conclusion that
they'll target this village, I mean, Naruto. There's no need to leave me out, right? I'm also concerned about
Akatsuki developments. Will Naruto...be okay? If those guys from the Akatsuki attack... Even Gaara couldn't... Well, he probably won't be okay. Right now anyway. Hi... First meetings are very important
in order to quickly open up to people... I have to decide on nicknames
and terms of endearment right away... Uh, I'm Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan. Nice to meet you.
Uh, you're Sai, right? Nice to meet you...uh... Character trait...character trait... Don't tell me... He's not going to say
that taboo word, is he?! Fa... Sai! "Fatty" is absolutely a taboo word
in front of Choji. Got it?! Did he...
start to say something just now? No, it's nothing... I see. It sure is tough coming up
with nicknames... My name's Ino Yamanaka. My family owns
the Yamanaka Flower Shop. Nice to meet you. In the case of a girl, saying a character trait
just makes them angry... In other words, if I say the opposite... Don't do it, Sai... Go, Sai!
Let her have it good! Nice to meet you...uh...
pretty lady. Why do you say that
when it's Ino?! Stop it, Sakura! Rat, Snake, Monkey, Rabbit, Rabbit,
Rooster, Ox, Ox, Monkey, Rat... Ram, Dragon, Boar, Boar, Horse
Rabbit, Rabbit, Dragon, Tiger, Rabbit... Rooster, Boar, Snake, Dragon, Rat
Rat, Boar, Dragon, Snake, Monkey... Snake, Rooster, Ox, Snake, Snake
Horse, Horse, Ram, Rooster, Dog... Dog, Dragon, Rat, Rat, Tiger, Rooster
Dragon, Rabbit, Monkey, Monkey... Ox, Snake, Rabbit, Dragon... Wrong one, huh...? Okay, time for some training. What is it? Well, it's been a long time
since I've trained with you. And I don't really know why,
but I'm glad. I see. Laugh it up while you can. The purpose of this training is to create a Ninjutsu of ultimate power
just for you. It will be a Jutsu that will
exceed the Rasengan. It will be a Jutsu that
will exceed the Rasengan? Next time: "Wind"


 Okay. No problems. All right, you can leave
the hospital today. By any chance, this isn't because
you want me to hurry up and take that baggage
with me, is it? Well, there's that, too... That Naruto. He refuses to leave
the hospital room so he can be ready to start training
at any moment... Truthfully, I was going to start
after kicking back. I mean, recuperating
at home for a few days. But I've run out of books to read... So I guess I'll just get right
to the training. That's right... Rasen! All right! I win. You have to treat me to
a year's worth of Ichiraku Ramen. Wake up, Idiot Naruto! Ugly... Huh?! Sakura... Wind


 Okay, time for some training. What is it? Well, it's been a long time
since I've trained with you... I don't really know why,
but I'm glad... I see. Laugh it up while you can. Time won't wait for us, so... As I told you at the hospital, the purpose of this training is
to create a Ninjutsu of ultimate power just for you. A Jutsu that will exceed
the Rasengan. Two techniques,
"Change in Chakra Nature" and "Change in Chakra Form,"
are crucial for that... Change in Chakra Form
and Change in...Chakra Nature? Okay, okay. You can't understand
two things at once. I was wrong.
Sorry about that. Then, first let's go with the explanation
of Change in Chakra Form. Right! Try making a Rasengan. Huh? Sure. Let's go! Right! Rasengan! Okay, stop! You've already mastered
the Change in Chakra Form. Your Rasengan has done that. R-Rasengan... Spinning Chakra like mad at
a super-high speed and then compressing it... This in itself is
the Change in Chakra Form and the Rasengan is a Jutsu
that has carried that to the extreme. Then that means I've passed
the Change in Chakra Form? Yeah, that's about the size of it. Yahoo! Okay, next is
the Change in Chakra Nature. Right, right... Let's see...
Take Chidori for example... This is a Jutsu activated
by simultaneously creating both the Change in Chakra Nature
and Change in Chakra Form... Watch this. I concentrate
Chakra in my right hand... I shift the property of this Chakra
into electrical current. So this is the Change in Chakra Nature... That's right. And now I shift the form
so it will discharge electricity and then I determine the range
and strength of the attack. In order to learn a Jutsu above
that of the Rasengan, this combination of
the Change in Chakra Form and Change in Chakra Nature is absolutely necessary,
like with the Chidori. Then I'll be able to complete
a new Jutsu in a flash if I add that Change in Chakra Nature
to my Rasengan! Listen.
That's easier said than done. In the first place, you still haven't
even learned Change in Chakra Nature. And you don't even know
what Chakra Property you have, right? Huh?! What Chakra Property? Well, I figured I'd have to start
explaining from there... Listen up. Basically there are only five types
of Chakra Properties. The five types are fire, wind,
water, lightning and earth. These basic properties are the basis for the names of
the "Five Great Nations" and they're also the foundations
of all Ninjutsu. No kidding. Really...? Everyone generally has Chakra
that falls under one of these properties. For example, the Uchiha clan
has the property of fire, and Fire Style Jutsu
is their strength. Wind has the Wind Style.
And lightning has the Lightning Style. Chidori is one type
of Lightning Style Jutsu. So that means Sasuke has the two properties of fire
and lightning, huh...? And you currently don't have any. Moreover, we don't know what type
of Chakra Property you're good at. What's that? I'll find that out with
this strip of paper. How're you going to do that...? The paper gets wrinkled
if it's a lightning property. It'll get cut if it's wind. It'll burn if it's fire. It'll get wet if it's water. It'll crumble if it's earth. This is litmus paper that reacts
easily to Chakra. It's made from a special tree
that grows while absorbing Chakra. If you flow your Chakra
into this paper, you'll find out
what property you have. All right... Your Chakra property is wind. Wind... It tears and cuts through
all sorts of things. It's Chakra with
outstanding battle strength. Ooh! I'm awesome! No, you've still only just figured
out your property... Now at last, we've come to the training for learning the Change
in Chakra Nature for wind... Right! However, it will take an enormous
amount of time to learn that technique. And so I hit upon a way to
drastically reduce that time. Awesome! And the way to do that is... Captain Yamato! Huh? Why, why? Kakashi asked me to help out
with this training. I'm sorry for interrupting you,
Kakashi Senpai... No problem... - And you see...
- Hey! Hey! What type of Change in Chakra Nature
is your Wood Style, Captain Yamato? Huh? Well... Well, his interest has
shifted that way, so just go ahead and tell him. Uh-huh... Then... Earth Style: Rampart of Flowing Soil Whoa! What?! Water Style: Waterfall Basin Jutsu! He made a waterfall... I have two Chakra Properties,
earth and water. What?! You have two of them,
Captain Yamato?! Jonin-class Ninja generally
have two or more. I've also got properties other
than lightning that I can use. Then, Captain Yamato has three properties
including the Wood Style? No, that isn't how it works. Huh? I can only use earth and water. There is no fundamental property
known as "wood" to begin with. Then how do you do it? He does it simultaneously. He does the Change in Chakra Nature
for earth and water at the same time and generates the new wood property. Earth with my right hand... and water with my left hand. That's awesome... If you have two Chakra Properties... it's not that difficult to use
each one independently. But when it comes to generating two Change in Chakra Natures
at the same time... it's a different story... The power to generate a
new Chakra Property by using two Change in Chakra Natures
simultaneously is called the Kekkei Genkai. You've at least heard of
that expression, haven't you? Yeah... That boy you once fought
named Haku used it He was able to use the Kekkei Genkai
known as the Ice Style... But he generated "ice" by using the two Change in Chakra Natures
of wind and water at the same time. It's a special Jutsu only those from a clan possessing
the Kekkei Genkai can use. Haku, too, huh...? So I couldn't copy it even with
my Sharingan... No kidding... Then what about Shikamaru's
Shadow Possession Jutsu or Choji's Expansion Jutsu? And what about Medical Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu? Hmm, an explanation of that stuff
would take a while and you'll just get confused
if I tell you all at once... Kakashi Senpai... Why don't you save the yin and yang of
Change in Chakra Nature for another time? Yin? And Yang?
What's that? Right. You wouldn't understand even
if I told you now. Now, what were we talking about again? Oh... Something about how
to totally cheat on training time... Reduce the time. Yeah, that.
So, how do we do that? Well, you see... Well, you see... Yeah? Yeah? Multiple Shadow Clones. Huh? As it happens, it's all about
Multiple Shadow Clones. What about them? It's how we reduce the training period. Hmm...I don't get it at all. Okay, I'll explain now, so listen up. Right. Please keep it
as simple as possible! Okay, okay. Listen up... Regular Clones the Shadow Clone Jutsu is a Ninjutsu Shadow Clones Shadow Clones Well, you can also call it a Ninjutsu
for creating a copy of yourself. I know because I can also use
the Shadow Clone Jutsu, though not to your extent. There is a particular effect this
Jutsu has on the caster. And since you're always using it,
I'm sure you've picked up on this... Anything experienced by
the Shadow Clone is also experienced by the caster after the clone has returned
to the caster's body. I told you to keep it simple. I knew you hadn't picked up on it. I mean, I have no idea
what you're talking about. Then let's both try
creating Shadow Clones. Oh, one clone will be enough. Right. Shadow Clone Jutsu! All right! Now let's split up into caster
and Shadow Clone teams... The Shadow Clone team will
hide in the woods over there. Come with me,
Shadow Clone Naruto. Right! The originals can't see us,
the Shadow Clone team, here in the woods. And now only we,
will play rock-paper-scissors. What for? Just do it. Hold it. It won't be any fun if we just play
ordinary rock-paper-scissors. It's not supposed to be fun. Then the one who loses has
to treat the other to Ichiraku Ramen. Okay, fine. Yes! Now I'm fired up! One, two... What're the Shadow Clones doing? You'll find out soon. Yes! I won! You have to treat me,
Kakashi Sensei! Okay, okay. Now we're going to
break the Jutsu and vanish. Right. What were they doing? You have to treat me to Ichiraku Ramen,
Kakashi Sensei! I beat you at rock-paper-scissors! What're you doing arbitrarily
making promises like that? Now you get it, right? Shadow Clone experiences are accumulated
within the original caster's body. I get it... I never realized it at all
because I was just sort of using the Shadow Clones
without really thinking about it. Normally, this Jutsu is used for
scouting dangerous locations and gathering information by infiltrating
an enemy hideout, you see. But even having figured that out, what does it have to do with
reducing the training period? Okay, okay.
I'm going to explain that now... Yes! Master Jiraiya sure did a good job of
teaching the Rasengan Jutsu to this kid... I'll say. Hurry! Hurry! Basically, if you use a Shadow Clone and conduct the same training
with two people, the experience will simply
be doubled, right? Right. Right. To put it a different way, it also means,
if you use two people, it'll take half the time it takes
to train alone. And it'll take one-third
the time if you use three. One-third with three. One-thousandth with a thousand. I see... In other words, training that would
take two days alone will take one day with two people. Even training that would take
twenty years alone will take around a week with
a thousand people. That's awesome!
So we can do it that way! He finally got it, huh...? You'll conduct
the Change in Chakra Nature training, you're going to learn now, using the Multiple Shadow Clones
at all times. Right! Now I know why you're so strong,
Kakashi Sensei! So this is
how you did your training, huh? No, I've never even once
trained using this approach. Huh?! Why not? You can also make
Shadow Clones, can't you? Indeed I can... But I don't have as much
Chakra as you do. And I can't sustain
my Shadow Clones as long, either. And the only types
of Jutsu suitable for me, since I don't have much Chakra, are the ones requiring an
even distribution of Chakra. Really? I have more Chakra than you,
Kakashi Sensei? You've got around four times
more than me. Huh?! I've got that much?!
I'm pretty awesome, aren't I?! If you didn't suppress the power
of the Nine-Tails Chakra, you'd have around
a hundred times more. The Nine-Tails Chakra... That's why this is a training approach
only you can do. But since it requires
a large amount of Chakra, there's a possibility of rousing
the Nine-Tails Chakra. And so I was summoned here in order
to control the Nine-Tails Chakra. You're the one who hurt Sakura, Naruto. I'm ready! All right! First you must train
to strengthen your Chakra Property. Right! Sandwich a leaf between your palms
and cut it just with Chakra. Keep it there until you cut it right
in half, okay? All right! Let's do this! And as I said before, you'll do this training with Shadow Clones
at all times. How many Clones should I make? Well, if you take
one person for one leaf... Maybe around that many. Huh?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Already got a little cut in, huh? This might be quicker than I thought. We've received a bad report. It seems a village near the border
of the Land of Fire was attacked by someone. Was it the Akatsuki? No. It seems the attacks were
by the Village Hidden in the Rain... What did you say?
What're their intentions? They might be intending to
take advantage of the fact that the Akatsuki
are after Naruto. Either way, we must understand
the situation first. Summon Asuma. But... What is it? Naruto is in the village. If there are less Jonin in the village,
his safety will come into question... Next time: "Writhe"


 Stabilize How's it going? Are you able to control
the Nine-Tails Chakra okay, Tenzo? There are no problems so far. I mean, please call me Yamato,
not Tenzo. Okay, okay. Yes! It cut quite a bit! Damn it!
And mine still hasn't cut at all! I'm much better than you guys! You're me, I'm telling you. Yes! Damn it...
That me over there's pretty good... I've got to do something... Say! Say! I've got something I want to ask you,
Kakashi Sensei... What is it? Is there anyone in the Leaf
who has the wind property? You going to ask about the trick to it? Yeah! Well, you could say
there's a person... Right about now
he's probably playing shogi... Check. Oh! I lost again! Our next end-of-mission party's
on you, Sensei. Right... Hey! Asuma Sensei! Oh, it's Naruto. Is there something you need? As it happens,
there's something I want to ask you... Writhe

 The trick to the wind
Change in Chakra Nature, huh...? Right! Don't tell me you're doing Chakra
Change in Chakra Nature training? Yeah! You've got to have a sense
for that kind of thing... Can you handle it? That's why I came here
to ask Asuma Sensei. You've got the same wind
Chakra property as me, right, Sensei? I never thought you'd have
the wind Chakra property, Naruto... This is indeed a shock. Asuma Sensei, please teach me
the trick to it...right away. Let me see... I could think about it if you'd pay
the barbeque bill for Team Asuma's
next end-of-mission party... Oh! That's dirty! What do you think? If that's it...
Just enough, huh? I'll lose everything I've got, though... I have no choice.
It's for my training! All right! It's a deal. This is my Chakra Blade... This blade is made from
a special metal that absorbs
the owner's Chakra property. That's awesome... Here, take it. Try pouring your Chakra into the blade. Right. My Chakra...kind of comes out
different than yours, Asuma Sensei. Listen up. The wind Change in Chakra Nature
splits Chakra in two and grinds them together. Grinds them together? And then you build up
the two Chakra as if steadily honing them. As if steadily ...honing them... That's right... The trick is steady ...and sharp. Say... um... I was thinking... What is it? Even though we've got
Ninja Tools to start with... is there a point to this wind
Change in Chakra Nature? Wouldn't it be quicker just to cut with
something that cuts right from the start? And is there a point... to pouring cutting Chakra into
a weapon that already cuts? Okay. I'll show you whether
or not there's a point to that... Listen up. We'll try throwing these Chakra Blades
toward that tree at the same time. What for? Don't worry about that. Let's go. One, two--! Th-That's awesome! It went all the way through... not just the tree but into that
really hard rock and got lodged inside... It's dangerous,
so I held back just now. It would've gone right through
the rock if I'd gone all out. The quality of the blade
will determine the result in the case of Ninja of the same level
getting into a serious battle. The wind Property has
the most attack power in close to medium-range battles. There really aren't that many...wind types. Oh, really...? Come on by if there's ever
anything else you want to ask me... But you'll have to pay
for the barbeque. Right! Thanks! Oh, it was a Shadow Clone? That Naruto... He forgot that we've got
Choji on our team. That's harsh... Can he really create something
like a new Jutsu before the Akatsuki start moving
into high gear? We'll see... Wouldn't it be best to keep
Naruto hidden somewhere before making contact with the Akatsuki? That's up to the Fifth Hokage to decide... I get it! So that's how to do it! All right! - Let's do it!
- Let's do it! It appears he found out the trick
to it from Asuma. He's already doing a good job of applying the attributes of
his Shadow Clones, that Naruto... Naruto... When a friend is putting extra effort
into work or a hobby, you should casually bring them
some refreshment. He's got more problems...
than extra effort... We've received a report from someone
in a village bordering the Land of Fire that they were attacked... Was it the Akatsuki...? The possibility is undeniable. But it seems there's suspicion
it might be someone from the Village Hidden in the Rain. Why...? Why would a neighboring village...? And if the worst were to happen,
conflict could develop between fellow lands. Perhaps they learned that
the Akatsuki are after Naruto and took advantage of the opportunity... They wouldn't be that short-sighted... But either way,
we must analyze the situation. Summon Asuma... Yes, ma'am... But then, there will be even
less Jonin in the village. If the Akatsuki were to come
for Naruto now, it will be a lot of trouble to protect him... Yes... All right! We'll go ahead and
have you accumulate experience. Ruminate in your head on
the training and break the Jutsu! - Right!
- Right! All right! Let's go! I can manage this...
I'll be able to do it soon... The drawback is that mental fatigue is accumulated
along with the experience... I knew that from the start... But...I'm almost there... Let's take a short break, Naruto. This isn't the time to be taking it easy! I'm okay, Kakashi Sensei... Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! What...? Oh! Hey...
Just a minute! Stabilize Whoa...That's incredible... You're really working hard, Naruto... Well, I guess with his stamina,
he'll be fine. Here you go... Thanks... Who're they for...? Oh, nobody in particular... See you later... Say "Hi" to Kurenai Sensei for me! Wha--?! How did...
you know that?! Oh, there he is... Sorry to bother you while you're
on your way to Kurenai Sensei's place... Huh? You guys, too?
How...? Huh? Everybody knows... Shikamaru! Oh...right... We received orders
from the Fifth Hokage for everyone from Team Asuma including myself, Choji and Ino
to assemble immediately. What?! What...? All members from...
the old Team Ten...? Yeah... Let's go! The four of you, Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara,
Ino Yamanaka and Choji Akimichi, are assigned the mission
to investigate a town near the border
that was attacked. - Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am! This comes at a time when Akatsuki
developments are of great concern! Tackle this mission with great care! What're we going to do
about Naruto? A D-rank mission like
 this should be perfect... Grave robbery, huh...? - Yes!
- Yes! I did it! Am I awesome or what?! At this rate, I'll master a new Jutsu
just like that! No...You're making fast progress
because of this training approach. It's thanks to my amazing idea... It's also thanks quite a bit to me,
Kakashi Senpai... More importantly,
I'm ready to get right to my next training. Well! You can do it because it's you. Naruto! Yamato, let's take a short break
while we're at it. Understood... Will Naruto be okay...? He should be fine if he rests a bit... Man, this kid's really something else... Umm... Hm...? What is it, Sakura...? Lady Tsunade wants to see you... Asuma Sensei! All right, it looks like everyone's here... Hey, hey, Sensei. What is it? Come on...
Don't you know, Sensei...? Oh...! It's the first time we've all gathered
before you wearing these earrings... Choji, Ino, you guys did well... And now along with Shikamaru
who passed last time, all members of Team Ten
are legitimate Chunin. And now, I will no longer be
in charge of you guys. From here on, each of you will
become a captain and lead new teams. These earrings are my congratulatory gifts
to each of you. Don't forget that you were members
of Team Ten! I see... It's the first time Team Ten... has appeared together in
a while, huh...? Why do I have to go so far as
to suspend my training to head out on a mission?! It's a mission, so we have no choice... But it depends on the mission,
doesn't it...? Why did that Grandma Tsunade give us some petty little mission
like a grave robbery...? Yo, Naruto...
What about your training? It was suspended for a mission... Ino, are you guys heading out now, too? That's right...
All of us for the first time in a while... You're all together... Konohamaru! You've got a mission, Brother Naruto? You could say that... What? Looking for cats again? That's right... This is already the seventh time...
I'm a veteran now. I see! You're hanging in there, huh?! Well, I'm off to give my report... See you later, Konohamaru. Good luck, Uncle Asuma! Uncle Asuma, huh...? Uncle...? Why? What do you mean why? He's Konohamaru's uncle, that's why. What?! Then, then... Asuma Sensei is
the Third Hokage's son... I didn't know that! N-Neither did I... No kidding...? Wh-What is it...? I never thought you were
the Old Man Third Hokage's son... I have the same Chakra property... And it's like...I feel more of
a sense of affinity than before... Well, you'll be able to continue
your training, no matter what mission
you take part in. Make sure you don't forget, okay? Steady...and sharp! Got it! All right, Team Yamato!
Let's head out on our mission! Hey, wait up! N-Naruto... Are you the team captain? Yes. I hear Kakashi Senpai
has a different mission, so... I leave Naruto...to you. Right. Hey, Captain Yamato!
What's keeping you?! Excuse me. Sorry! Sorry! Now, I guess we'll get going, too! - Right!
- Right! He is learning at a phenomenal speed... But he's still got a long way to go
before he develops a new Jutsu. I expected that. I'm sorry about this at such a time, but I want you to meet up with Jiraiya and look into developments
with the Akatsuki. I'd like to be able to give Naruto
time to focus on his training, but... Naruto wants to get it done
as quickly as possible, so he's pushing it quite a bit. At this rate, even with Yamato around, there could be another explosion
of power if he continues to train... I don't think I'm making a mistake
in this judgment. Look...at the people's suffering. Their tears! Their anger! The Land of Fire has no need
for neighbors... Words are not necessary for those
who cannot understand one another... The Land of Fire must rise now and be the tallest mountain
that unifies the world. For this reason... the decayed and rotten Leaf
must be gotten rid of... We shall...awaken the Land of Fire! I'll get this mission over with right away
and get back to training! Come on... Don't get careless thinking this is just
a D-rank mission! I know! Why does Grandma Tsunade
have us chasing after grave robbers?! We have no choice.
Don't be complaining about it now. But... Well, speaking of grave robbers,
they're just one kind of thief, so... We can't say that for sure
in this particular incident. It seems they're not after money
as would normally be the case. What do you mean? I still don't know for sure, but it looks like there's some kind
of ulterior motive. Next time:
"Deprived of Eternal Rest"


 Deprived of
Eternal Sleep


 Get a move on, Naruto! We'll leave you behind. Is he trembling? I can totally do this
even on a mission if I try. I knew it. He's afraid... It was that talk...
from yesterday. What's keeping
Captain Yamato? Really. I wonder
where he went off to. Captain Yamato? Yikes! Captain Yamato! Don't scare us like that! Sorry, sorry.
I couldn't help it... Your acting is always serious
and totally scary, Captain Yamato! It's really worthwhile
teasing you, Naruto. But Captain, about what
we were talking about earlier. Why would someone
violate a grave? That's awful... Yeah. Well, usually the graves of
wealthy individuals are targeted and items such as ornaments buried
with the body are stolen... But the body and treasure were
untouched in these grave robberies. The grave robberies have
been occurring frequently within a five-kilometer radius
around the Fire Temple where we are now headed. Fire Temple? Right. It's the temple that
commissioned this mission. Their request is for us to help out with
the capture of the grave robbers. But I get the feeling there's something
more to these grave robberies. As it happens, there are four hidden tombs
in the area around this temple. Any chance the grave robbers were
targeting those hidden tombs? Yeah, there's a
good chance of that. Just a minute.
What are hidden tombs? The variety of information
resting in the graves along with the deceased Ninja
is like a gold mine. Like Sasori whom
you fought before... He used the body
of the Third Kazekage and turned him
into a puppet. That's right. The greater the Jonin Ninja,
the higher the utility value there would be. So it's necessary to keep the graves
well hidden using things like barriers so that the bodies will not be stolen
and then used for evil purposes. That's what
the hidden tombs are. Then some really amazing Ninja must be
resting in those hidden tombs, huh? Yeah, and
these four in particular. They have information just
that worthwhile to steal. No kidding? But you know...
there's also one other possibility. It could be that the graves weren't
violated from the outside. In other words... the bodies came back to life
on the inside and... Yikes! Just kidding. Naruto believed what
Captain Yamato said... I'll do my best! This is the rendezvous point. Some people from the Fire Temple
are supposed to come meet us here. Oh, man. I'm tired, too. Hey, you're irritating me. You can sit over there! Okay now.
Don't make so much noise. I knew it...
He's afraid. They're late. I wonder if we've got
the wrong landmark. I'm going to
have a look over there. I'll go, too. Huh?
Them I'm going, too. You and Sai wait here. We might end up
just missing them. Fine. It'll be okay. I'll stay with Naruto. Don't scare me like that! If a friend is frightened or scared
about something... put your hand
gently on their shoulder, provide them with some warmth, and let them know
they are never alone Okay. Th-This might be... tougher than I thought... What're you doing? I-I thought
it would be for the best... No way, man. I'm not into stuff like that! No! That's not what I meant! Uhh, in the case of a
misunderstanding with a friend... It's totally dangerous for
the two of us to be together! Sure enough,
I should be with Sakura! Oh! Naruto...! What the heck did I do wrong? I just don't understand what
Sai's thinking about. Saku...ra... Don't tell me...
it's the grave robber... It's a boar?! I'm sorry! Whoa! Don't come this way! What's this? I've seen something
like this before... A barrier? Could this be... A hidden tomb?! What is this place? There's no coffin.
Was I too late? Who's there?! It's...the grave robber! Wind? What?! Eat this!
Beast Wave Palm! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here I come! It's that attack from before... Beast Wave Palm! Damn it! That's an annoying wind Jutsu... Wind?
I see! You also use wind... It's time for you to repent!
I'll wait three seconds. Your time's up.
Now it's divine retribution for you! What's with this guy?! You're  the one
who'll be getting retribution! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Beast Wave Palm! Scatter! Eat this! Beast Wave: Palm Hurricane! Die! Enough, Sora! Naruto! It was just as you worried,
Lord Chiriku. On the way to pick up the guests, I became concerned about the
hidden tomb and came to have a look. And the barrier
had already been broken, the coffin stolen,
and this guy was there. Are you trying to lay
your crime on me?! You're  the one
who's the culprit! What're you talking about? You were the one who was
in the hidden tomb first! The coffin was already gone
when I got there! Who can corroborate that?! Who can corroborate
your story?! I'll give you the retribution
you deserve, you jerk! Why don't you just try it?! I'll just do that! I won't give in! You darned jerk! Huh?! What?! My Leaf brethren! My name is Chiriku
of the Fire Temple. We missed each other due to
a mistake in the rendezvous location. I am terribly sorry
for this misunderstanding. What?!
This guy's one of the guests? And he's with the Hidden Leaf? Then...this guy's... His name is Sora. He is a trainee monk
of the same Fire Temple. Sora, huh? My name's Yamato and
I am the captain of this team. This is Naruto and... I'm Sakura. My name's...Sai. I told you we don't need any help
from the likes of the Hidden Leaf. Sora! Lord Chiriku! There's not a shred of evidence and Lord Kitane's coffin and
all have been taken. The barrier was
broken with great skill... and we believe it was a Shinobi
of considerable power. If the enemy is
a Shinobi of great ability, then it was worthwhile summoning
the people from the Hidden Leaf. Head on back and arrange
to have skilled individuals guard the other
three hidden tombs! And tighten security
around the Fire Temple in preparation
for a potential emergency. Yes, sir! You guys head to
the Fire Temple for now. Understood. Hey, any chance your Chakra has
the wind property? Don't ignore someone when
they're talking to you! I'm talking about
your Jutsu from before! It was this hand, wasn't it? Don't touch me! Jerk... Are we there yet? It's the same as my dream... from back then. Hey, Naruto. What's been annoying
you since earlier? Looking at that jerk
Sora's movements, it's like he's
mocking training, just doing it any old way,
or something... Huh? Why?
He's training hard, isn't he? That's not what I mean. Compared to his movements when
he came at me before... Oh, I can't take it.
I'm going to complain. Hey, Naruto... For crying out loud! Hold it. Next time:
"Loneliness"


 This way. Are you kidding me?
I can't believe this is happening... Oops. You okay? Yeah! Thanks, man. Huh? You jerk! Divine retribution for you. I'll kill that guy! Okay, that won't do. Damn him, damn him,
damn him, damn him! Sora! What have you done?! Okay, okay, my bad. I'll kill him...
I'm definitely going to kill him. No, no, you'll receive
divine punishment if you do. Welcome back, Lord Chiriku. How are things progressing? Sir! We have already sent Shinobi monks
to the remaining three hidden tombs of Lord Nauma, Lord Tou'u
and Lord Seito. They are all the finest of
Fire Temple monks and arrangements have been made
for them to inform us immediately if something unusual happens. We have assigned several men to
the search for the remains of Lord Kitane. We have also tightened
temple security and are ready just in case something happens. Then I suppose we can rest easy... It took you guys long enough. Sora...! He's sure got an attitude problem! That jerk! We have returned. These are the people from the Hidden Leaf who came here in compliance
with our request. Hello. I'm Captain Yamato. And this is Sakura, Sai
and Naruto. From the Leaf?
That is indeed reassuring. That's right. Just leave it to us! We are prepared to move out
whenever necessary. Either way, you won't have to until
we hear from the Shinobi monks. Until then, please come this way. Loneliness


 I wonder what they'll use...
the stolen bodies for. Well, maybe they wanted the information
the bodies held... or perhaps... Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation! One! Two! It appears the third one didn't work out. Oh well... Their objective might be to use
the body itself as Orochimaru did. Well, I doubt you'd come across a group that can use a powerful Jutsu
like that every day. No kidding? Then the four Ninja resting
in those hidden tombs must've been really powerful. Wh-What? They were remarkable Shinobi. And most of all, they were good people. The tombs of Nauma, Seito,
Tou'u and Kitane are located to the east, west, south and north
with the Fire Temple as the central point. They were all members of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. The Guardian Shinobi Twelve? I've heard of them. I've just heard the name. Huh? Are they famous? Well, to those in the know,
I guess they're well known. The Guardian Shinobi Twelve
was an organization comprised of elite Shinobi
gathered from within the nation to protect the Feudal Lord of
the Land of Fire, you see. Huh? But it's Shinobi from our Leaf Village
who protect the Land of Fire, right? Yes, the Hidden Leaf Village does
protect the Land of Fire. But to be exact, a village is
an institution to protect the land. It's not an organization just for protecting
an individual Feudal Lord. Then... First, the Feudal Lord who is
the apex of the land, must be protected in order
to protect that land. The Guardian Shinobi Twelve
is an organization assembled with such
a concept as its foundation. I was also young back then. I joined the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, willing to lay down my life
for the Land of Fire. Then you were also...! I used to be. Incidentally, Asuma also
used to be a member of the Twelve Guardian Shinobi Warriors. - What?!
- What?! Asuma, huh? Is he doing okay? Yeah! He's good! He gave me some training advice
the other day. Oh... I see. So that means... This incident...
to you and to Asuma Sensei... It means your friends' graves
were violated, right? Those four people lost their lives
at a young age for the sake of the Land of Fire. Within the Guardian Shinobi Twelve a faction attempting to stage
a coup emerged... and that ended up dividing the twelve. A coup is an attempt to change a land into one's ideal notions even if it
means resorting to a forceful approach. Even I know that! People who radicalized the notion
of wanting to protect the Land of Fire and who possessed extreme ideologies ended up emerging within
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. That's right! In other words...! They couldn't leave matters
of the Land of Fire to the moderate Hidden Leaf Village. They wanted to create
a land of strengthened military force with themselves at the center...
or something like that. Yeah, or something like that.
That's unforgivable! Naruto! Keep quiet! Right... Their plan was to break up
the Leaf Village and turn that military force into an institution with
the Feudal Lord at the center. It proceeded so far as to influence
the Feudal Lord. And at the same time, they were making preparations
to attack other lands. What did you say?! Without making do with peace forged
with a delicate balance among the Five Great Nations, they waved the banner of
a noble cause in which the Land of Fire would unite the world
and total peace would be attained. That's so selfish... Yes... War is war, no matter how splendid
the song and dance may be. As expected, the Feudal Lord became aware
of their radical thinking and... The six people who staged
the coup died. However, Kitane, Nauma,
Tou'u and Seito...also fell victim. I can't believe something
like that happened. The four people of
the hidden tombs were friends of Chiriku and Asuma Sensei. For example, let's say... our friend Sasuke were to die
and his body were to be stolen... That's right. We can't forgive the people
who stole Kitane's body. Yeah, it's unforgivable. It's the night training for the boy monks. It's that jerk, Sora. Begin free sparring! What is it? That's strange. What is it already? Oh! I'm getting ticked off! Bow! - Thank you!
- Thank you! You... Hey, is it okay like this? Are you screwing around? You're the one who's screwing around. I don't know if it's training or what,
but this is like what you're doing. You jerk! You really tick me off. You're messing with me,
aren't you? I don't really know why
but you're making me angry! Naruto...! That idiot! Your name's Naruto, right? Yeah. Let me give you an even better one... I'll give you a deeply moving
posthumous name. Posthumous name? Naruto! It looks like you've
finally gotten serious. You were strong back
when you fought me... like you are now! You really tick me off! Isn't this...a little bit too intense? Not again... What's with this guy? His power's suddenly
become ineffective. Those eyes...
They're looking at Sora? It's the same eyes. Why are they also looking
at you with those eyes?! That's enough, Sora! I can't stop! I failed to give you a posthumous name. Whoa! What're you doing?! I just thought I'd wipe off the sweat. Cut it out! That's gross. Hey, Sai. What's a posthumous name? Well, I guess it's kind of like...
a nickname. It's a name given to the dead. So it's like the nicknames
you give people?! That means
it's a sign of friendship, huh?! Sora! Hey! What is it?! Lord Nauma's grave site! Beast Wave Palm! Beast Wave: Palm Hurricane! They're awesome...your Jutsu! Is this also the wind
Change in Chakra Form? What're you doing here? Oh... I thought I'd give you
a posthumous name too! Fine... Give me a good one! Sora! Sora! Sora-cchi.
Soran! Soran-chan. You jerk! Don't mess with me! What happened in that temple? You're...an annoyance! Yeah, people have kept thinking
that about me since I was little. You, too... right? Then...! What of it? Yeah! People think I'm a nuisance! But something like that
doesn't bother me at all! I'm the one who thinks
I'm a nuisance the most of all! That's right... My power is a nuisance. You... But nuisance or not,
I can't throw away this power. Because I must have revenge...
on the one who killed my father. Revenge?! It's a patrol bird! Is it the hidden tombs?! Naruto! Where were you? Sorry! There was contact from
the Shinobi Monks who were heading for
Lord Nauma's hidden tomb. It seems it was after the tomb
had been broken into and the body taken away. Say what?! At this rate, the other two will also be... We're ready. Let's go. Right. I'm going, too! All right! All right! I'll pound
those dirty grave robbers! We have received a message
from the Fire Temple. It seems all of the hidden tombs
have been violated by the enemy. They got us.
So what's the present situation? Team Kakashi is on the way. What's the enemy after? So they were after the bodies
of the Shinobi chosen to become
Guardian Shinobi Twelve, huh? We know nothing about any developments
regarding Orochimaru and the Akatsuki, so we're unable to fathom
Lord Danzo's true intentions... There are causes for
concern everywhere. Then we should start by dealing
with what's within reach. Next time: "A New Enemy"


 Lady Tsunade! We have received a message
from the Fire Temple. It seems all four of the hidden tombs
have been violated. They got us... So what's the present situation? Team Kakashi is
on the way right now. I see... Yamato sent a report saying the enemies probably
aren't just grave robbers. So he was right. Yes... Then what are the thieves after? Probably the bodies themselves
of the exceptional Shinobi who were members of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. I have a bad feeling about this, it's all happening right
after that other attack. And the activities of the Akatsuki
are shifting into high gear. And developments
regarding Orochimaru, who has hidden himself,
are a concern as well. And... You mean Danzo? Oh, yes... Leaving Sai on Team Kakashi
was our request as well. But isn't there something behind
why he agreed without any fuss? There are piles of causes
for concern everywhere we turn. But we should probably
pluck the seeds of trouble... and we start with
what's within close reach. Then what do we do? Shizune! Assign everyone
who's not supporting the Foundation to the surveillance of Danzo! Yes, ma'am! I have a favor to ask. A favor, you say? Yes... I would like to ask you to
keep me in Team Kakashi under this name for a while. That smile on his face... Damn that Tsunade... What is she prying into now? Oh well... When all is said and done,
it's all in the palm of my hand. A New Enemy


 This isn't the same direction
as the hidden tombs. The thieves are carrying
heavy coffins, body and all. The east, west and north directions
with the Fire Temple at the center are surrounded by steep cliffs. If they are trying to escape to
the neighboring land carrying the coffins, the only direction is South. I see. My power is a nuisance. But nuisance or not,
I can't throw it away. Because I must have revenge
on the one who killed my father. Hey, what're you looking at?! Oh! You mentioned revenge, didn't you? Oh... Oh... We came out to a place
with a great view. But the enemy
won't show up here. That's right... There's nowhere to hide. Naruto! Hm? What is it? Down there... Oh, Sora! Look down there,
down there! Shut up! I can see it! No doubt about it.
Those are... Those definitely seem to be
the stolen bodies. But why are they transporting them
in such crude fashion? It's as if they're attracting
attention on purpose. Is it a trap? If it is, then perhaps
they're targeting... They're going to
get away at this rate! Captain Yamato! Chiriku, please wait here and
contact the Fire Temple, just in case something happens. Got it. Naruto and Sora,
you guys pursue head on! Sakura and Sai will follow from the left, and I will wrap around to the right
and provide back-up. Hey... Why do I have to
go with him?! Sending you alone
would be a concern. Besides, Sora looks to be
quite dependable. I get it. I read in a book that
one poison drives out the other. Oh! Hey, wait up! Hold it! Let me tell you one thing. I'm tired of being around
a repulsive guy like you! Shut up! If Captain Yamato decided on this,
then we have no choice, right?! Then you just stay behind me
and keep quiet! This is a Fire Temple matter! You back-talking jerk! I'm going on ahead. Jerk! Heh...They fell for it. There's nothing here for us to
protect ourselves with if this is a trap. The conditions should be the same
for the enemy, too. We should be able to locate them
from a distance if they approach. If their objective is to steal
the four bodies, there's no point in setting a trap. Why are they going to
the trouble of doing such a thing? Didn't I tell you?! I told you to stay behind me,
keep quiet, and just watch! Excuse me while
I go on ahead again. Don't get so full of yourself! Ow! Sora! Knock it off. What're you two doing?! The coffins went underground. And here I could've gotten
at least one of them back if this rotten guy hadn't interfered. You're the one
who got in the way! What?! This time I'll give you
a posthumous name for sure! That's just what I want! Before that, hurry up and
pick one for yourself! Cut it out, you two! This isn't the time to be fighting
amongst ourselves. That's strange... All signs of the enemy's
presence has vanished. It's sure been a long time. Oh, how long I've waited for
the dawn of the Land of Fire. This isn't the time for you guys
to be dying. Unexpected circumstance is something
that sets up a good arrangement. Or did you guys
do the summoning? Fudo, Fuen, Fouka! Yes, sir... I'm going to say hello to him. You guys take care of the others. Yes, sir! This is the design diagram.
Move it without destroying it, okay? It's a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece
of perfect quality. Acting like you're so big. I'm the one who has
to do the moving. Masterpiece it may be. But it's nothing but scribbling
if I don't move it. Don't you know? With woodblock prints, the one who lives on in history
is the artist who created the design, not the one
who did the carving. What?! Nobody likes men who talk too much.
Just get started. Or Furido, a former member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, will strangle you. Ooh, that's scary.
Then, I'm counting on you, Fudo. Fine, I'll do it. Earth Syle: Impermanence! What's...this?! Sai! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll What is this? This much geological change
with Earth Style? It seems we've received
divine retribution thanks to a certain someone. This isn't the time to be
saying that kind of...! Sakura! Hey, wait! So the true intention is to
crush me like this, huh? They probably won't wait for me
to climb up to the top. If so... Wood Style Jutsu! They sure set quite the large-scale trap. I see. So you and Sai ended up
getting separated. And before I knew it,
Captain Yamato was gone, too... If we're dealing
with an Earth Style user who can alter terrain to
this great a scale, then it's an enemy
we can't take lightly! Anyway, we've got
to find the others quick! Hey... Didn't this used to be a valley? What's this? Just like that? Is this a Genjutsu? I bet it's a trap. Then let's test it out. Huh...? Hey, Naruto, don't get careless.
You'd better stay away. Heh, no problem. It seems, more or less,
to be solid ground. The guy who did this
is probably a moron, he forgot to create this part here
and rushed to finish the job...! Naruto! He got caught
in the trap just like that. We've got to find
Naruto right away. I guess for now I'll try making a sweep of
the entire area from up in the sky. They're not going to
let me out of here. There's no way you can
escape from my masterpiece with a puny Jutsu like that. I never thought
you'd survive our Jutsu. My Jutsu was perfect. Fuen probably didn't follow through
with the execution of her design. Don't tell me that's the Wood Style. Who are you? "Who are you?" That's my line. What do you intend to do
by stealing those bodies?! It's not necessary to tell someone
who's about to die. Then I'll have to get you
to talk by force. Heh! You want to get into
a contest of strength with me? That's futile! Earth Style: Inescapable Suffering! What a disappointing
Wood Style user! I get the feeling it's kind of
a waste disposing of you, but... What a pain. Sure enough, direct attacks
are more up my alley. You can't fully guard against
my fist by just dodging. Where are we? I don't know... But where's Naruto? I thought we all dropped together.
I don't feel his presence here. For the time being,
we have to go find him. It seems the enemy
wants to separate us. Ow-ow-ow-ow... Where are
Sakura and the others? Another fork in the road? This way! No way will I fall twice. So this means this path
is the right way. It's not that way. I won't be done in by
a ridiculous trap like this! Whoa, I was about to get flattened... Fuen's traps are nothing special. This is a mess. I can't believe our team would
get divided so easily. But what in the world
are they after? If they wanted to just steal
the bodies of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, there should've been a way
to do it without drawing attention. Don't tell me they're
really after one of us. It's too soon
to jump to conclusions. I have a bad feeling about this. I've got to join up with
the others as soon as possible. Next time:
"Impermanence"


 Whoa, I was about to get flattened... Fuen's traps are nothing special. I can't believe they're this skilled. I can't handle him anymore. Did I get him? That won't work! Damn you! It's futile! Scurrying about like that... Earth Style! Stone Plate Coffin. It's over. I guess I can at least make him
a grave marker. I had to work up a sweat
on account of that jerk Fuen. You place too much confidence
in your own Jutsu. You have to make sure
you've finished the job. But what are they after? After stealing the bodies, they intentionally attract
attention in their escape... Are they after one of us
from the Leaf? If so, is Danzo involved? Impermanence
  
 It appears we totally got caught
in the enemy's Jutsu. First, we must join up with the others. I bet they evacuated to
some nearby location. Huh?! I'm off to find that awful jerk. Just a minute! There's no point to looking together. For crying out loud. So in the end,
everyone's scattered all over... I guess it can't be helped. It's not like he received
any training on teamwork. Come to think of it,
didn't Naruto flunk that part? What's the deal with her?! Oh, boy. I hate...manual labor... And here the plan was to let the traps do the work
without me having to get involved. I guess I have no choice.
I'll take care of this. I'll end this lickety-split! Let's go! What?! What the heck are you doing
out of the blue like that? What?! This taste of Chakra leaking
from your Chakra Network. So you've got the rare wind
Chakra nature, huh? So what if I do?! How about becoming part
of my collection? Hm?! Huh? Do you prefer French or soft? Are those foods or something? They're kisses. In other words...
You mean you're going to kiss me?! Yes.
You're such an inexperienced boy. You still haven't even
had your first kiss? Yikes! What?!
Don't mess with me! Even I've had experience kissing! It was with a guy, though. I see. Well, whatever.
How about having lots of fun with me? Not a chance!
Who'd want anything to do with you? Oh, my... I've been turned down... Hey, what's with her?! I'm not good with women like that! You must not turn down a proposition
from a woman, kid! I-won't-let-you-get-away. No! C-Cut it out! Reaper Kiss. What?! You missed! Too bad! Your kiss was kind of cold, but soft. Here you could've gone to
the next world comfortably if you'd just held still... Well, guess which one of us is real! Now you've made me angry. This isn't a Genjutsu. I summoned the terrain
I designed and created from a different spatial environment.. You can't escape now. I'm not so stupid as to fight in
a field created by the enemy. It's useless to hide. You'll never be free from my eyes. After all, you've already
got my mark on you. I can see right through you
no matter where you try to escape to. Did I lose her? I've got to join up
with the others quick. So you chose that path, huh? She shouldn't be able to see me. Why?
Why are there traps wherever I go?! I'll bring the playtime
to an end here. How unfortunate... All of your movements appear
on this design drawing. Earth Style: Spears of Stone This is the finishing blow! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll Spears of Stone! He got away. I can't believe he made
a fool of me. Well, he might just be
on the right track since he was actually able
to outmaneuver me. This isn't the time to be
standing guard over an old man. A night transmission?! What's that? It's an owl.
Is it a Blakiston's fish owl? I want to know what an owl
is doing here! Oh! It's an urgent report from
the Fire Temple. It seems Team Kakashi,
in pursuit of the grave robbers, has been caught in an enemy trap. Why didn't you say that sooner?! I took care of one of them. Unlike your opponent,
mine was a kid with some fight in him. Did he get away? This is the perfect labyrinth
I have created. There's pretty much
no way to get out alive. I wonder. This is just a precursor
of the traps to come. Maybe I'll give them a round
of applause if they are able to escape
from my traps. This smell... It's sulfur. It doesn't seem to be poisonous. Sai! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll Sai! Sai, don't move! You've got a broken bone. This is going to hurt a bit,
but tough it out. That should do it!
Now for the spider poison. It's of low toxicity,
so you don't need to worry. I'll neutralize the poison right away. Umm...were you moved? Huh? You were moved, weren't you? That's why you're doing this... What're you talking about?! "Recommendations
for Self-Sacrifice"?! Yes. In order to create better
personal connections, with women in particular... it says it's effective to lay down
your life for someone. Maybe I'll try this with Naruto, too. What? Knock it off! Now that you've made me angry,
your luck has run out, boy. Now you're serious?! That's what I want! Okay, bring it on. Can you kiss all of us at once? Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu! You're just a boy, after all. Now, I wonder where the real one
is hiding. Did I get her? What?! Damn it! What's going on? And here,
I'm sure I felt like I hit something. Earth Style: Hidden in Stones Jutsu! It appears you've got
some fight in you. Now I want your wind Chakra
even more. Are you immortal? No way can you be unharmed
after getting hit by my Rasengan. Your attacks are still too soft. More importantly, this time for sure
you will receive my kiss of death. I won't let you do that so easily! First, I'll make it so
you can't talk back. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Oh, my. No artfulness at all.
More Shadow Clones? Then I'll go with... Water Style! Mouth of the Serpent! What?! She has earth, fire and water
Chakra natures. She's got three of them? Lighting Style: Earth Flash! What?! Lightning?! She's got four Chakra natures! What the heck is that?! Who're you?! So you're Sora, huh?
I missed you. Damn it.
Mysteries of the female body, my foot. Hair is the most important thing
to a woman, my foot! I don't want to know anything
about stuff like that. At any rate, earth, fire, water,
lightning, wind... She has all of the Chakra properties. But I'll do my best with
my Wind Style. Now I'll show the fruits
of my training! Hey, wait a minute. I still haven't learned
any Wind Style Jutsu. Next time: "Contact"


 So you're Sora, huh?
I missed you. Who're you?! Hurry up...
Get over here... Sora! Who are you already?!
How do you know my name? Over here, come on! What's he planning? Contact


 What the heck are you up to? What's that smell? I'll let you have one, too! Whoa, hot-hot...? A baked sweet potato? I was getting tired of waiting for you. And I got so bored I baked
some sweet potatoes while I waited. Oh! This is pretty good! Sora!
Come on over here! You said you were waiting for me, right? You're hungry, aren't you? This is good! This is good! I told you!
Have some more. Something smells... That's because you're eating
a sweet potato. The smell is carried on the wind
as it blows through... The smell of the earth from
Lord Kitane's hidden tomb... Blasphemous! This jerk... Just shut up and eat
what you've been served! The same goes for you!
Give back the four bodies. If you don't...
you'll receive divine retribution! I've been receiving divine retribution
ever since I was born. But the funny thing is
I just don't seem to die. You should do whatever you want... It's not the time for you to be
giving people retribution. That's right...
I will  do what I want. So I'm going to beat you! Don't mess with me! Oh, what's the matter?! Who the heck...is this guy? Oh, are you done already? I might've gone a little overboard... But... It'll be okay if I remove
the scorched part. You're mine! Wind Style:
Scattering Flower Dance! She can use...Wind Style... Earth, fire, water, lightning...
and wind... She can use Jutsu from
all the Chakra natures? Are you surprised? There are still many things
you don't know, boy... About women, I mean. Don't run away. I'm going to tell you about
the mysteries of my female body. Yikes. There's a mystery
I don't want to know about... Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu! Water Style: Mouth of the Serpent. Damn it. What's going on? Uh oh! Lightning Style: Earth Flash! What's the matter, huh?! Are you done already? Damn it! You've got spirit! Now I think it's about time
you showed me your true power! And do it without using
a toy like this! No good, huh? Hold it... What is this?
Oh, but this sensation... If you want to see my power
that badly... Take a good look! Yes! Yes! But...it's still not complete... It looks like you've finally
gotten motivated! Do your chattering in hell! That's a fine wind! Beast Wave: Palm Hurricane! We've got to join up
with the others quick... I'm worried about Naruto and Sora... Sai?! Sai! I just got a little lightheaded. Let's find Naruto and
the others quickly. The poison spread faster
than I thought... What do you think? If you show weakness
once in a while, you can get closer to people... I won't allow it if you say
that was written in a book. You don't find the most important
things in books! You just have to physically
learn things like that. You're right. Where is everyone? Then I'll use this Shadow Clone Jutsu! Oh, the wind stopped! All right. Whoa, what's this?! How dare you... How dare you kill me! Huh?! What?!
Is it a Substitution? You're the bane of women, boy. Do you have any idea how many years
it took to grow my hair this long? Hair is the most important thing
to a woman... You will take responsibility for damaging my most
important feature! I can't move.
Is this a Paralysis Jutsu? Damn it! Just like that... Now boy, let's share a hot kiss. But your soul will be mine. S-Stay away! Now... Damn it!
Where'd he go? What?!
What the heck happened here? It's your power! You altered the landscape with the power you unleashed
in an attempt to repel my Jutsu. This is your true power... This is...my true power... That's right.
Heaven granted you that power. It's still got a long way to go. It will become a much
more massive power. So much so that you won't be able to remain suppressed
in that tiny little temple... That's why you must seriously
consider how you use that power. Cut out the gibberish. Will you use it for your own gain
or as outbursts of your emotion? Or will you go beyond your home
and village and offer up that power for this nation,
the Land of Fire? I see. I might very well be
a terrible guy. But in life those four people
in the hidden tombs fought and died for the Land of Fire. If I were to say I was going to
use the bodies for the Land of Fire... I wonder if they would nail me
with divine retribution. For the Land of Fire... That's right! I will use this power
for the Land of Fire. Who the heck are you? I've once held you as a baby. I know...your father... What did you say? Reaper Kiss. What? My Chakra... What is this place? N-Naruto! Y-You! What're you doing?! No, something's wrong... You say...you know my dad? Naruto?! Naruto! Let Naruto go! Are you okay, Sakura? Captain Yamato. I won't let you interfere! Earth Style:
Stone Pillar Prison Jutsu! Oh no! What?!
What is this evil Chakra?! Fouka?! Damn you. You jerks! I'll give all of you
posthumous names! Sora... -Huh?!
-What? Oh, this is the kid... Oh, he's the one, huh? I've come to back you up! Nobody asked for that! You're the one who called for help! I didn't call for help
or anything like that. I see... But as long as I'm here,
I have no choice... Let's go! Right! Naruto! Sora! It's dangerous to fight!
Get out of there! I don't think so! It appears we'll just have to do this. It's three against two. It's four against one because
you'll just get in the way. Naruto! What is it? Heck if I know! I'm sorry we're late! Assistance is here! Chiriku... Lord Chiriku! Now what will you do?! Isn't it about time? You're right. It doesn't look like
we need to stall for time. Who the heck is he? To the Hidden Leaf? Yes. We have to go back to
the Village Hidden in the Leaves for a bit. Now that things have
turned out this way, we need to once again solicit
instruction from the Hokage. And our team will probably continue
to be in charge of this incident. How about it, Sora?
Could you help us out? Unfortunately, as you can see, it will take time for Sai to recover. Since you're from the Fire Temple and have been protecting
the hidden tombs, I think you would more than
adequately fill the gap left by Sai. We don't need to force ourselves
to ask him to come, do we? Naruto! For once can't you think
about where you are?! You really will receive divine retribution. Seeing the outside world might
also be good training for you. Either way, you're the one
who must decide, Sora. They weren't targeting Chiriku
with their traps. Then we can presume that... Okay, I have to write up a report,
so I'm out of here. And I have to take Sai to the hospital. -Let's go, Sai.
-Right. Huh? Wait a minute.
I need to continue my training... Kakashi Sensei isn't back yet, right?
You show Sora around the Leaf. I refuse. Who'd want to hang around
with this  guy? Don't complain.
We're counting on you, Naruto. Sora's now our teammate
on Team Kakashi, so... Next time: "Teammate"


 Then there were no developments that would suggest
the Akatsuki organization. That's right... However, there is probably
no doubting that a serious situation will develop. It was a horrible sight... The village was attacked
in one night and most of the villagers were dead. Hidden Rain... And sure enough, as if weaving
along the border, several other villages
were attacked after that. They were all Land of Fire villages. Asuma, don't rush to conclusions. I understand that. They go to the trouble of leaving
the Hidden Rain mark... I don't care for that approach at all! Is there someone
who wants to start a war? Perhaps... But sometimes
a guess hits the mark exactly. Is there no information on developments
with the Hidden Rain? Nothing at this point. But what we should be
concerned with is... The Land of Fire, huh...? Yes...The Feudal Lord... There might be someone who recklessly instigates
the Feudal Lord, huh? Like with the Guardian
Shinobi Twelve before. The ammunition to intrude
in the situation might be supplied to Danzo,
the old military faction leader. He's a sly customer to deal with,
after all. Assign some Anbu members
and village Jonin and have them try to find some
information around the area of the border. But since we don't know
the present situation, have them work in secrecy. And make sure they know that our village is absolutely
not to stir up any action. I will send a letter
to the Feudal Lord. Yes, ma'am. Team Asuma will move out the moment there are
any new developments. Stand by until then. Understood.
I will be leaving then... Excuse me. The Guardian Shinobi Twelve... Come to think of it,
Asuma was once... Yeah. In those days when
he was a kid around twenty, he spewed some kind of
tongue-twister rationalization like... "I'll do what I have to do
for the Land of Fire..." jumps down the Third Hokage's throat,
and leaves the village. Well, from my standpoint,
it was just a simple father-son argument. Uh-huh... It happened ten years ago. One part of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve
staged an unsuccessful coup in order to turn the Land of Fire
into a military superpower. The Guardian Shinobi Twelve
were split right in two, and Asuma and his comrades
brought that group down. Hi, Asuma Sensei! Oh, Naruto. Are you making progress
with your training? Well, I actually
didn't have time for that. I see...
What're you doing here? Captain Yamato told us to
wait out here until he calls us. Hey! What're you doing glaring
like that?! Well, I... I'm sorry he has such
mean-looking eyes... Hey, you apologize, too! Wh-Why do I have to...? So that's what happened? And although they lost their lives, Kitane, Nauma, Tou'u and Seito
stopped the coup. It was their bodies that were stolen. What did you say?! I am very sorry.
There were four thieves... and they were a group that used
quite advanced Earth Style Jutsu. What are they intending to
use the bodies for? Things will become problematic should the precious Jutsu information
resting with them spread to other lands. Yes... Also, Sai was injured during the mission
and I had no choice but to have him leave the team,
though it will only be for a short time. And as for his replacement
on Team Kakashi, I would like to add
the young novice monk who was also
assigned to the mission. But, well... What is it? Well... Teammate
  
 I see... So those four grave robbers were
lying in wait for each of you? At that point in time, I had Chiriku, the one they were
most likely targeting, leave the unit. So I think we can eliminate him. In which case... there's a slight chance that,
like the Akatsuki organization, they were targeting Naruto
who is a Jinchuriki. But it was a coincidence that we were dispatched
to the Fire Temple. And so, that leaves that kid
called Sora, huh? Yes. In which case,
I think it would be in our best interests to have him in the village
working with us. Of course, this is after consultation
with the Fire Temple. Anyway, we're counting on you, Sora! Behave yourself in front
of Lady Tsunade, okay?! If you don't...
something terrible will happen. That's right. Witty remarks don't work
on Grandma Tsunade! Huh? Is that
supposed to scare me? I don't know if she's an old lady
or a Hokage or what. But I'll pay my respects! Naruto! Sakura! Bring Sora in! Y-Yes, sir. - Okay, come on!
- Whoa... See you later, Asuma Sensei. H-Hey?! Hurry up! Excuse us. Lady Tsunade! Hurry up and apologize! There are great limits
to my patience! Who's an old lady?! I called you a Buddhist saint! A Buddhist saint?! Yes, yes! Well, doesn't this little boy
say adorable things? You pass! Welcome to the Hidden Leaf Village. H-Hey. That hurts... You've sure grown up, Sora. Okay, I have to write up a report,
so I'm off. I'll take Sai to the hospital. Okay... Hey, wait a minute.
I need to continue with my training! Training, my foot. Kakashi Sensei's
out on a mission, right? You show Sora
around the village. Sora's now our teammate
on Team Kakashi. Heck no! Why do I have to be
with this obnoxious guy?! I don't want to be with
this awful jerk, either. Yeah, yeah. You guys just go at it
as much as you like. I won't be joining in anymore.
Let's go, Sai. Right... Okay Naruto,
I'll leave Sora to you. Y-You guys are dirty! So they're the same, huh? Huh? I'm just a burden, aren't I? Hey, it's not like that. Sakura and Captain Yamato
don't think you're a burden. If they did, you wouldn't have been brought here
to this village, right?! I know that. Then what is it?! Forget...about your revenge. The two things aren't related! I know, but... My dad was a hero to me. He was a courageous man with
a powerful inner strength. I only have memories of him
up until I was five. The people at the Fire Temple
never told me anything. And yet, I happened to hear
about my dad being killed... as they shouted in contempt... "He got what he deserved!"
"Killing him was the right thing!" My dad could never have
done anything devious! It must be some kind of mistake! I'll rectify that... And then after I've done that,
I'll get the guy who killed my dad! You... So don't be following
me everywhere. It's irritating! Irritating? I'm showing concern for you
and that's your attitude? Huh? That's just called meddling! I'll feel out the enemy
on my own. I'll take over this village...
in ten minutes! Just do whatever you want! I don't want to deal with you, either! What's he going to take over? For crying out loud, where'd he go? You want to fight, huh?! I won't go easy on you just
because you're a dog, you awful jerk. He's glaring at Akamaru? This is not good.
If Kiba shows up here... Oh, Naruto. You're back? Oh, Akamaru! There you are. Who's he?
I haven't seen him before. Oh... he's... Hey, you! What're you trying
to do to Akamaru, huh?! You're the owner? If you are,
then keep a leash on him and train him not to bark
all of a sudden! Akamaru isn't a pet! And he barked at you
because you're suspicious! Where are you from?! I'm from the Fire Temple. I've come to take over this village. Huh? Sorry about this, Kiba.
I can explain. He's kind of with our team and... Naruto! Is he with you? Knock it off! I'm not friends
or anything with this guy! Just keep quiet, Sora! Fighting's no good, you guys. Don't be so testy and let's get along. Shut up, Fatty! D-Did you just say... "Fatty"? Yeah. So what of it?! Th-This is not good... Uh oh... All right! Let's have a battle royale! Hey, are you an idiot?! You're the only opposition here! Let's go, Choji! Heh! What can you do
with a Fatty like that?! You said, "Fatty," again, eh?! I'm not fat! I'm a chubby-type! Whoa, you idiot! Cut it out! All right! Keep a hold on him, Choji! You guys are dirty! Oh...! It's one against everyone? It can't be helped. He asked for it. Uh, even so... Ohh, I guess I have no choice! Hey! Enough, already! Naruto! Are you taking his side? No, I'm not! But I can't just sit here
and do nothing. Huh? Why side with an outsider?! I have no choice. He's a Team Kakashi comrade, so... Comrade... So let's just calm down now and... And let's discuss this... Hey! You're hitting me
with your punches! You're the one who's been
hitting me with your kicks! What?! Are these guys morons...? That hurts! Hey! You'll never get me to join in. Hah...That wouldn't suit you, right? It's enough to just
let them fight it out. Now we've got one more person
in this village, huh? Why wasn't I invited to the "meeting of fists under a sunset sky
to develop the friendship of men?!" They can fight forever
because they're tough. Well, I guess
that's about enough. Huh?! Man Beast Clone! Leaf... Expansion Jutsu! Shadow Clone...! Wind Style! - Uzumaki Barrage! - Beast Wave Palm!
- Severe Hurricane! - Human Boulder!
- Fang Over Fang! What's this?! - I'm not fat!
- Oh! Whoa. Hey! Now then, let's have a party
at the Barbe-Q after the "meeting of fists." Barbe-Q! That sounds good!
A dinner with tons of guys! So after all's said and done
it's another party, huh? You're going, too, right? No, I don't particularly... How's Chiriku doing? Come to think of it, I hear you're acquainted
with Chiriku, Asuma Sensei! Yeah... M-My dad's name
was Kazuma and... You've got some
pretty good moves. Chiriku must've trained
you quite hard. No... Lord Chiriku was a great person
at the Fire Temple, you see. It's my own style. Oh, I see...
So you got that good by yourself. Oh yeah! Hey, Asuma Sensei.
Show him that! That? That's incredible... The trick is to do it
steadily and sharply. That's right! Once you learn the trick,
you'll be able to send your Kunai Knives and Shuriken
right through a tree trunk. See you around. Good luck. Hold on! If you know my father,
I want you to tell me about him. He was a member of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve and his name was Kazuma... Huh...? Why was he killed? My father didn't do
anything wrong. That's what I believe... You know him, don't you?! Kazuma... Kazuma died sticking to
what he believed in. No matter how things ended, he died for the honor
he himself believed in. Oh... Okay, I'm leaving... H-Hey... Are you going to do training now? Damn it... I won't lose out to you! One, two, three, four... At a glance
it looks like about thirty... Yeah, around that many... It's going to be quite different
this time around. We're going to destroy
a village of the Kohaku Clan with some of the greatest Shinobi
in the Land of Fire. And... With great precision.
We'll kill all of them. Yeah... I know. They were just
diversions until now... This time... At last... Oh! Let me know if there are
any Shinobi with the wind property. That one will be mine. Hey! Everyone
in the Kohaku Clan! You're all going to die! But your souls
will become sustenance to protect the Land of Fire
for all eternity! I promise you that! Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you. Do it. Sora and Naruto, huh? It'd probably be impossible to
quickly hammer formations into them. Then Team Kakashi will proceed
with your own training for a while... Then I get to continue the training
I was doing before, right?! No, well, you know,
you need Kakashi Senpai for that... What? Then what am
I supposed to do? Let me see. Why don't you have Asuma
supervise your training? Yeah! What? It has to be me? Next time:
"The Two Kings."


 Sora will become a member of
Team Kakashi on a temporary basis while Sai recovers. And so now I'd like to practice
some new formations. - Yes, sir!
- What? Forget about that. I want to do Wind Chakra training. The awful guy makes
a good point for once! Cut out the "for once" stuff. Oh! That's right! I had something
I wanted to ask you, Captain Yamato. I want you to tell me a few things about
the Change in Chakra Nature. Well, this is a dilemma... If I tell you,
you'd better seriously practice! Okay... So, what's your question? You said you create
the Wood Style by combining the Earth Style
and Water Style, right? That's right. That's because I have
the two properties; water and earth. Kakashi Sensei said that
when you become a Jonin... you become able to use
two or more properties. Will I also eventually be able to
use stuff like the Water Style? Hmm, I don't know about that. You're born endowed with
the Change in Chakra Nature, so we'd have to find out whether
you have the Water Style. So that means
no matter how hard I try, I won't be able to learn it
if I didn't have it in the first place? In your case,
your fundamental property is wind. So even if you did have
other properties, they could turn out to be weak. Because of that, Jonin obtain
their second and third properties by training to be able to
use that weak Chakra. Then that means it's rare to be
able to obtain all five properties? At the very least. So far as I know
there aren't any Shinobi who can use all five properties
right from the start. Then... Wind Style:
Scattering Flower Dance. Then how the heck did she...? Is that it for the questions? Then let's begin
our formation practice. It's futile to teach a temporary team
something like formations! Asuma. First of all, Naruto isn't the type
who thinks and then acts, right? And it seems Sora
is of the same type. Don't lump me together with him! What's your problem? It seems they're both power
and close-combat types. So wouldn't it be best to place them
on the front line... let them do what they want and have the remaining
two people back them up? I understand that, but... Backing these two up, huh? Well, it's a stretch trying to suddenly
hammer formations into them. The rhythm of comrades is
something learned gradually... by acting as a team. Then that means... "Formation yada, yada, yada"
comes after that. You're right. Then each of you will do
your own training for a while. All right! Then I get to continue the training
I was doing before, right?! Right, Captain Yamato? No! You need Kakashi Senpai for that. I know! As I recall, you're on standby right now,
aren't you, Asuma Sensei? Why don't you guys have Asuma
help you with your training? He has the same wind Chakra nature
as you guys, after all. - I'm ready, Asuma-Sensei!
- Let's do it! I asked first! So what of it! You, get lost! - Be quiet!
- He shoved this off on me well. What?! The Two Kings


 Did you guys do all this? Yeah! I did more than half, though. You liar, Sora. Huh? You want to fight?! What're you doing out of
nowhere like that?! Let me tell you one thing. I'm not obligated to force myself
to supervise you guys. If that's clear, then take out
your Kunai Knives and throw them while forming a mental image
of your wind Chakra. Even so, you don't have to hit us... Damn it! Just you watch!
I'll make you say, "Whoa." This much power without
using a Chakra Blade, huh? I see. How about it, Asuma Sensei?! I'm more awesome than
this guy, right? Huh?! Take a good look,
you awful jerk. - What's your problem?
- Listen, watch closely. Can you tell the difference? The hole's small. Exactly. This is imagery training
for increasing the accuracy of wind-natured Chakra. You're making holes
in the target tree. You're forming mental images
of destruction as it were. That's why your mental images
of wind-natured Chakra aren't turning out right. You strayed from the steady
and sharp mental image of the Chakra
and got distracted. In other words, the size of the hole
is the size of the distraction. I get it. The size of Sora's holes
is the size of his distraction. Yours beats me, though. Say what?! You can fit three squirrels
in your hole! You can fit five in yours! Then seven! Indeed, it should be possible
for them because their Chakra is exceptional. Naruto I understand, but Sora, too... This training isn't about the amount
of Chakra you use. Form mental images by concentrating
each and every time. - Right!
- Okay! Increase the accuracy of
your wind Chakra. - Let's do this.
- I won't give in! This is Sora's... You say you were contacted
by Chiriku? Yes... We've found out something unexpected
about Sora. Sora is Kazuma's son? Well... The thing with Kazuma
is water under the bridge. The issue is what's to come. "This remains unknown to
the outside world..." Around ten years ago,
there was a tragedy that brought the Fire Temple
to the brink of destruction. I rushed to the temple...
after receiving a report. And what I saw was like
a scene out of a nightmare. Even the glorious Iron Wall Seal
of the Fire Temple had been ruthlessly destroyed. Out of the way!
Stretcher coming through! Hey, hang in there! Lord Chiriku... What happened? I-It wasn't human. It wasn't...human? It was enveloped in
evil Chakra. H-Hey! I'll take him now! This is horrifying. What the heck happened? I don't know. All of a sudden, something
strange happened to Sora. Things got out of hand... We all tried to stop Sora.
But this is how it turned out. Sora did this? Needless to say, we did a thorough examination
of Sora's body after that. But we couldn't figure out the cause. We had surveillance
on Sora at all times. But he would never rampage again. However, those who remembered
the incident loathed Sora fearing his mysterious power... and would avoid him. So this is the reason
why Sora felt like he didn't belong at the Fire Temple... But what was the cause? Indeed, it seems the cause for
Sora's rampage remains unclear. Yeah... That's probably why Chiriku
was concerned as well. It seems he wants
to take the opportunity while Sora is here in the Hidden Leaf
to have him looked over closely. I see... At any rate, Sora is just like... Yeah... All right. It's starting to get dark,
so we'll continue tomorrow! What?! Tomorrow?! All right! - He's going to supervise...
- All right! our training tomorrow, too! - A-Actually...
- All right! All right! - All right! All right!
- Oh no... All right, I'm going to train
like crazy today! Hey, that's sneaky. Damn it!
One more time. I'm just getting started. Oh, man...
I'm stunned by their stamina. Ichiraku Ramen And in addition to making me
hang around for their training, they leech food off me, too. Okay! Here you go. - Thank you!
- Thank you! Check, please! Sure. Thanks for your business! Ah, I'm stuffed! Now, I can't look out for
you guys anymore. Now you guys have to get
the hang of things on your own. Right.
I'll master it no problem! What a dirty...breechcloth! You should say,
"It's seen a lot of service." Heh!
My dad's was nice and clean. Huh?! I don't remember
my dad's face very well. But even now I can never forget that spotless and
clean breechcloth. To me, my dad is
that white sparkle itself. But I heard that
he was killed because he schemed to make
the Land of Fire his own. Most people would gossip
about him intentionally so that I would hear. And so I was glad that
you seemingly cleared that up, old man! All right!
Then let's continue our training! Oh! That's dirty. Hold up, Sora. Well, this is the perfect time.
Join me for a bit. Okay, we're here. What is this place? Is the item I asked for finished? Oh, Asuma. I had a hard time getting my hands
on this much metal. Here. Wh-What's this? It's my...! How?! I had your broken claws fixed
with the same materials used in Chakra Blades. These suit you, don't they? It just didn't feel right not
having these, sure enough. When did you start using those? From the day I was born! But why did you do
this for me, old man? Oh. Lord Chiriku asked you, huh? What's the first thing
you're supposed to say when someone gives you something?! Ow-ow-ow!
That hurts, old man Asuma! I'm not an old man yet! Ninja Tools
MANTENDO


 I've always been by myself.
I don't need any help! Oh, boy! He's so defiant. But you were right, Chiriku. He's better suited to village life
rather than temple life. The Land of Fire
doesn't need two kings. The Hidden Leaf is
just one military force. The king known as the Hokage
is not necessary! A country needs only one king,
the Feudal Lord. Feudal Lord, excuse me
for bothering you while you are resting. Have you betrayed us, Asuma? The Feudal Lord will not
accept your ideas. Therefore, he left things to me and
has been moved to a safe location! Asuma! Kazuma! The one who finished Kazuma off was... You're sure sentimental. Oh, Kurenai. Shall we go to a movie or something? This isn't like you. You smoke too much.
Why don't you quit? Well, if I can. Daddy, buy me a baked sweet potato! Sure. Three baked sweet potatoes, please. Coming right up! And here I thought he'd
come right after me. You're a cute kid,
so I'll throw in one for free! Thank you.
Hey, say thank you. Right.
Thank you, mister. Sure! You're a good kid.
I'll give you one more! What's the first thing
you're supposed to say when someone gives
you something?! Thank you... huh? Thanks! Yo! You're that jerk from back then! You've got nerve marching right
into enemy territory... What're you planning? How petty.
Then is the Hidden Leaf an ally to you? I told you that you've been granted a massive power
from heaven, didn't I? What a waste. If it were me,
I'd use that power for a great cause. No way will I listen to what
you have to say! Keep your shirt on! I went to the trouble of coming here because there was something
I forgot to tell you. Let me tell you something good. The one who killed your father
is the former member of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve,
the backstabber Asuma Sarutobi. It's up to you whether
you believe it, or not. Why old man Asuma?! Those are for him.
See you around. Danzo's gone?! Sora... You've been acting strange
since you got back. Hey, what the heck... Shut up... Leave me...alone! That's strange.
Why did Sora suddenly start sulking? What could the cause be? No good. I can't think of anything. Don't you have any Cliff Notes
or something among your books that explains human thought
in a simplerier way? But Sakura said I should learn stuff
like this through experience. I can't keep associating with him while he's so moody and unfriendly. Really? But I get the feeling butting heads
is perfect for you and Sora. Next time:
"Jet-Black Signal Fire."


 When facing a higher-skilled opponent... make up for the difference
in quality with quantity! That's the basic battle skills
you taught us. How can you do this
to an old man? I can't believe you'd treat
someone this poorly... On Lady Tsunade's orders, you are to be captured and
brought back to the Leaf Village. What's this...?! He's from the Hidden Rain... Jet-Black Signal Fire


 How To Make Friends
Dictionary of Social Relationships
How to Become Friends with Strangers "If a friend suddenly gets
into a bad mood, "the cause might be due
to changes in eating habits." "Like the color of soba
and udon noodles..." I have no idea what
they're talking about! Well, neither do I... Huh? What? Aren't there like
Cliff Notes or something that explains human thought
in a simpler way? Sakura said I should learn stuff
like this through experience. Huh?! Heck no. With him, it'll be a fierce struggle...
I mean...like a wild uproar. Oh man... Anyway, we'd both go all out
and it'd be really ugly. But I think understanding each other... by butting heads would work
for you and Sora. Well...I'm not really good with stuff like that... I have to read more about it. I don't really get it... That Sora... And here I thought he was
getting used to things in the village... What the heck happened to him? Lord Danzo... Where are Asuma and Yamato? They have been summoned... Explain yourself, Danzo! Right now, when things are turbulent
at the border with the Hidden Rain, why was it necessary to go
to the trouble of meeting with a Shinobi from
the neighboring land? Are you listening?! Wait a minute... I've seen this man before...! When I was with the Anbu,
he went missing during a mission. As I recall, his name was...Tatsuji! So he was the spy Lord Danzo
sent to the Hidden Rain? So you were sniffing around
on your own, huh? I don't know what you were looking into
in the Hidden Rain... But you will tell me the information
you know. Was the Hidden Rain involved
with the previous attack? I can't believe you haven't
even figured that out yet... Princess Tsunade,
your conservativeness is fine with me... But such complacency
will destroy this village! So you had no intention of talking
from the start, huh...? Very well. If that's the case... Don't bother... Do you think he'll talk? There are many ways to do this... You summoned me, Fifth Hokage? I'm counting on you, Ibiki. Please leave it to me.
In just ten minutes I'll get him to talk. Tsunade... Why are you losing your patience? A Hokage is supposed to
act more dignified. And you even dragged Ibiki into this. This is unacceptable...
even as a strategy. Now, now...we'll handle this. Danzo, Tatsuji wasn't just your spy. He was sending us information
as well... He's a fellow member of the Leaf...
He is not a double spy. According to the report, the Hidden Rain was not involved
with the border attack. More importantly, according to Tatsuji,
it seems he was assigned the other day on a mission to track and
monitor the group of four... thought to be the ones who violated
the hidden tombs near the Temple of Fire. Then... Just as you all feared, it seems those four were trying
to get their hands on... that Sora boy from the Temple of Fire. Tsunade, you know about
the past incident that boy caused at the Temple of Fire, don't you? Yes. I don't know the how, but there is no doubt that boy
has some kind of power. Power equivalent to,
if not greater than, that of the stolen Guardian
Shinobi Twelves' bodies... I can't believe you'd invite something
so unknown and dangerous into the village. If you're the leader of this village
dedicated to protecting it at all, you should make a decision immediately. But we can't just send him
back to the Temple of Fire. Then should we incarcerate him? No... The source of the disaster
threatening this village must be swiftly dealt with. Extermination...? This is your true power. Why is this power of mine
so ostracized? This time... This time... Old man Asuma... Tsunade... You're the Hokage,
so you make the decision. Think hard about how
it will benefit the Hidden Leaf. - I won't...
- Let go! You jerk...! Let go of me, you masked jerk! Quiet down! Sora! He was hiding in the back of the ceiling. Damn it! Not a chance!
Extermination, my foot! Is my power that much of a nuisance?! You jerks are the same as
the guys at the Temple of Fire! You're the seed of disaster. Danzo! Damn it! All of you jerks... Comrades, my foot!
Forget Team Kakashi! Sora... Are you saying I'm going to be punished
with divine retribution... for trusting in people just the tiniest bit?! Be quiet, Sora! Asuma! I've got something
I want to ask you... Did you... kill my father? The former member of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, the backstabber Asuma Sarutobi. Are you the one who killed...my father?! Yes, it was me. I'm the one who finished him... I mean...killed him... I was the one. Asuma! Kazuma! I get it now... What's this...?! How dare you! How dare you!
How dare you...! Stop! Wha--?! That...right hand... Sora... What the heck is...your power...? How dare you...kill my father... How dare you...! You okay...Sora...? Naruto...! You jerk! What're you doing sticking
your nose in this?! You said it, didn't you? I came to help. No one asked you. As long as I'm here,
I have no choice. "As long as I'm here,
I have no choice," right? You jerk! Why did you attack, Sora?! The Foundation, huh...?! Sora...! Naruto...? I'm okay. You betrayed your comrades...
and my father... I'll avenge my father! Sora! Wait! That idiot... Naruto...! Don't let him get outside
no matter what! All of the gates have been closed. All right, then restrain him
with the Destruction of Evil Seal! This is mortifying... But no one can destroy
the sealed iron walls up ahead... What?! The same dream again... It's mistaken because there are two kings... The Feudal Lord of the Land of Fire...
and the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf... There will always be chaos
and distrust if there are two kings. And when anything happens, decisions will be late and
the invasion of other lands will occur. Kazuma's notion was very simple. He just wanted to unify
the Land of Fire as one... And...Kazuma attempted
to set the two kings right... But he was tricked by
the very problem itself. At the end of the day, the people of this village will stick
with this village's king. Asuma chose the Hokage, this king... He doesn't understand
why this village can shine... The true king...
the Land of Fire's king allows it to shine! All for the Land of Fire...
That was Kazuma's cause. Isn't that why you were entrusted
with your power from Kazuma...? My cause...is revenge for my father. That's fine. But look hard
at what's past that. At the true revenge Kazuma desires. Let's go together, Sora.
Carry out Kazuma's cause. If you do that, I'll create as many chances
as you need to defeat Asuma. The other king... The Hokage... Sora! Sora! For crying out loud...
What a pain he is... Is this as far as the scent goes...? Hidden Leaf Hospital I'm always impressed by
your recuperative strength. Everyone looked all over for him. He might not be in the village anymore. No! I get the feeling he's still in the village. Yeah... Okay, get some rest tonight. Right... That Sora... This Chakra...? This Chakra sensation... Rage? No doubt about it... Sora...! Grandma Tsunade! You okay, old lady?! Yeah... Sora! What's this Chakra...? No! Stay out of this! You! Why did you try to kill her...?! Out of my way, Naruto! Lady Tsunade! Wait! Sora! Naruto! Wait, Sora! What? The power's out in the village. I wonder if everyone went out. That couldn't be. It's a power outage! Oh man, we're out of luck. What?! I don't like the dark. It'll be okay.
The power will be back on soon. But it seems to be kind of prolonged,
doesn't it? Come to think of it,
you could be right. What do you think, Konohamaru? I've got a bad feeling about this... Huh? And things are really helter-skelter
in the village right now. I hope something strange isn't going on. Next time:
"Lockdown of Darkness."


 At any rate,
I wonder where the heck he went... What?! Wait! Wait! Sora! Lady Tsunade! Sakura? I'm gathering the unit captains
for a meeting right now. I'll talk to you later. What the heck happened here? Sora came after me. No way... Has there ever been this big
a power outage before? It might not be just
a simple power outage... I wonder if things will be okay... Oh! Of course things will be okay! This village has the Hokage, after all! Are you saying
you can't trust the Hokage?! Stop your whining! Th-That's right. We have the Hokage with us! It's not the circuit breaker. Then we stand by in Area 3, right? Yeah, as it says in
the contingency planning manual. And the off-duty unit captains are
probably gathering at the mansion. If so... Tasty. Preparations complete!
Now I can go full throttle anytime! Let's hurry, Shikamaru! Right... You're not getting away! What's going on? Is it a power outage? Oh, man...
I don't like the dark... It appears something strange
is going on. - What?!
- What?! Close the main gate! The hotline has been secured. Now we should be able
to respond, no matter where the enemy attack
comes from. Good work. This is it, huh...? I allocated too many personnel
 to the Hidden Rain border. As you have probably seen,
we're experiencing a power outage and the entire village is
without electricity. There is a possibility
it was caused by an accident. But considering there has been
no contact from the power facility, we should probably take action under
the assumption that this was deliberate. Therefore, as of this moment, this village will enter
a level two state of alert! Company Three will be dispatched
to the east, west and north gates. Company Two will go to
the main gate! Company One is assigned to check
on the situation at the power facility! Asuma! You stay here. Don't overlook the slightest
unusual occurrence. Dismissed! Sora attacked me. Sora...?! Fortunately, the situation
didn't become serious... Just a minute! You were attacked, Lady Hokage?! By Sora?! Naruto is in pursuit. You head after them immediately. It may be difficult, but it's a fact.
Accept it. As soon as you find Sora,
take him into custody. Yes, ma'am! What is it? I get...the feeling the forest
moved just now... Is it an earthquake...? Travelers! We're sorry,
but the village is occupied right now. We cannot let anyone
in from the outside-- What's that?! An enemy attack has been confirmed!
The main gate is under assault. The security units are now in combat. So it has begun, huh...? Go! Don't let them get near the main gate! What's the battle situation? You idiot! Stay away! I will take charge now. Shift to a long-range attack! Lockdown of Darkness


 The enemy has not been stopped! One kilometer to go
until the main gate! The security unit is engaged... - Naruto...
- in a tough battle! That way, huh...? Sora! Wait up, damn it...! Why did you attack Grandma Tsunade?! Leave me alone! It's got nothing to do with you! Oh yeah?! Of course it does! Barrier Defense Seal Jutsu! Eight-Gate Lock Up! Wh-What...?! Hey! There's one in the direction
of the east gate...! And the west gate, too! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! What is this...?! Raise the level two
state of alert to level one! Send everyone on stand-by
to the main gate! Yes, ma'am! Summon Shikamaru. Inform him of the situation and
have him draw up defense measures. Yes, ma'am! Sakura, you get ready to move out, too. Yes, ma'am! What...?! What happened? They've...come... Wait a minute, who's they...? What do you know?! A barrier?! A barrier! - What?!
- What's going on?! The enemy...has put up...a barrier. A barrier? What kind of barrier? It's probably a "Defense Barrier." Huh? Oh... It's a barrier used for defense. It's used to defend
against enemy attacks, or as a wall to keep
the enemy from infiltrating! Why would an enemy attacking
from the outside want to defend? Defense aimed at us on the inside...
is weird. It's not weird. Defense aimed at us...
That's... In other words, we are... That's right. We've been trapped inside
the village by this barrier. Now what is it?! The four of us have come here
on an unerring mission. On behalf of the future strength
of the Land of Fire. We have come here to
enact our indomitable will. Now, listen to what we have to say.
We have only one objective in mind. And that is the glorification
of the Land of Fire with the Feudal Lord as
its one and only king! The king here in the Hidden Leaf Village
is a threat to the true king of
the Land of Fire. We will not allow the existence
of two kings! Don't you get it?
We're saying we don't need your Hokage! What...?! There's no need for approval.
You guys will help us, either way. You'll help us by becoming corpses... I learned that you can't get into
or out of a defense barrier... That's exactly right. In this case, we should assume
the enemy got through the barrier using a special Jutsu. Right now, the situation is that the Hidden Leaf Village
has been confined and only the enemy can come
and go as they please. Now that we have allowed them
to infiltrate the village, we must shift to stage two of
the Sneak Attack Measures Manual. We're ready to fight anytime! - Yeah!
- Yeah! No. Initiation of a counterattack will come
after we have evacuated the civilians. You guys, guide everyone quickly
to a safe location. This is your first A-rank mission. Got it! Dismissed! I'm counting on you guys.
I'll stall for time here. You can't just say whatever you want... We won't let you get your hands
on the Fifth Hokage! We must hold on
until the reinforcement units arrive... Fudo! Earth Style! Impermanence! What?! Get back! Lady Tsunade, I'm ready. Now that we can't avoid direct combat, it's the duty of a Medical Ninja to save
as many of the injured as possible. Go! Yes, ma'am! Though not to perfection,
we've done just about all we can. And yet, what is
this uneasiness I feel?! It's just one thing after another... These guys are awful... This is the ultimate Earth Style Jutsu! Soil Bodies! Come back to life, Shinobi corpses! Our dead Shinobi are your opponents! What do you know about me?! Nothing! Who are those guys?!
What did you do?! It was the Hidden Leaf who tried
to eliminate me first! Grandma Tsunade would
never do something like that! She did! I just tried to get her before she got me! I finally caught up. Asuma Sensei! You backstabber, Asuma! Sora... Why did you target the Hokage? The one you want revenge on is... The one you want revenge on... is me. Don't touch me! I just copied what you did! The king you chose...
going so far as to kill my father... King...?! This time I'll kill her! What're you talking about?
I don't get it at all! No...it's the truth. Sora... You called Lady Tsunade "king" just now,
didn't you...? The Land of Fire doesn't
need two kings. The king known as the Hokage
is unnecessary! A country only needs
one king, the Feudal Lord. According to the report, the Hidden Rain was not involved
with the border attack. More importantly, according to Tatsuji, it seems he was assigned
on a mission the other day to track and monitor
the group of four, thought to be the ones
who violated the hidden tombs near the Temple of Fire. Just as you had feared,
it seems those four were trying to get their hands on
that Sora boy from the Temple of Fire. It's starting to make sense. There's something... No! This is terrible...! What's the matter, Asuma Sensei? If my guess is right,
this village is in deep trouble! Don't rush!
Remain calm and focused. The objective of the group attacking
the village might be... indiscriminate mass slaughter. Say what?! Cut the nonsense! It all makes sense! Why were the grave robbers after the bodies of
four Lightning Style Shinobi? It's because they're familiar
with the power of the Jutsu of the four Lightning Style Shinobi... And they hit upon the idea
of using that power to wipe out the entire village. W-Wipe out...?! Hey, Sora! Is that true?! Wiping out the village... That means everyone will be killed! I don't know! I don't know anything! Sora! I must go. We must stop this
as soon as we can or something terrible will happen, Naruto. Sorry, but I leave Sora to you. Right. That uncomfortable feeling I was
having all along finally makes sense! What Sora was talking about,
and the word "king"... There's no doubt about it! The one carrying out the intentions
of that coup is also behind this series of incidents! Red Blue White Black Charging complete... What did you say? The guys attacking us right now
are Shinobi from the Land of Fire? Yes. Judging from that
distinctive characteristic, there's no doubt
they're from the Kohaku Clan who live in a village on the border. But most of the Kohaku Clan
was supposed to have been killed in a past attack. Maybe the villagers
have been brought back to life with some kind of Reanimation Jutsu. What a terrible thing to do. Yes. It's unforgivable... They killed this many people just
to turn them into weapons! Next time: "Revived Souls."


 That uncomfortable feeling I was having
all along finally makes sense! What Sora was talking about,
and the word "king"... There's no doubt about it! The one carrying out
the intentions of that coup  is behind these series of incidents! Red Blue White Black What? We're already being invaded?! But...what the heck is this? There's so many of them. And this... And this isn't normal. You guys are late! Genma! What's going on here?! We're going to find that out now. Ino, I leave the Medical Ninja Team
back-up to you! We're counting on you! Yes, sir! That tattoo... It's the Kohaku Clan. What's...the Kohaku Clan? They're a Shinobi Clan near
the Land of Fire border... and their village was one
of the villages victimized by the past several days of attacks. We went on an investigation
to a different village and almost all of the villagers
were killed in one night. How could they do this to
fellow Land of Fire countrymen? That's unforgivable! Then...that means these people
are the ones who were killed? The enemy probably used
some kind of Reanimation Jutsu to bring them back to life. Which means they're being used
as weapons just to attack us?! For crying out loud!
How many villages did they attack? What an awful thing they've done... Sorry for this! Damn it! No way...! Furido, it's almost time. Yeah, this turned into
a nice display of fireworks. I guess the four should have
the preparations almost complete. And Sora, too... It's time to back them up as planned. Right... Let's go! Dismissed! Kitane... Nauma... Tou'u... Seito... That Jutsu of theirs...
Oh my God... Uncle Asuma! Konohamaru! What're you doing?! We're in a level one
state of alert right now! I know that. We just sent the kids in the village
to the evacuation area! I see. Then I have another mission
for you guys! If you see anyone
of Chunin rank or higher, tell them to come to the power facility! Huh? What's happening? The village...is in danger... I can't believe they're going
to kill everyone... Sora! Wait! Revived Souls


 What's this...? What...? Blue  Red  Black  White S-So that's what this is about... The enemy didn't just
bring back your Jutsu, but your actual selves... Seito... Tou'u... Nauma... Kitane... Asuma... Asuma...? Yeah... I see... That's right. This is your village, isn't it? Kitane... You guys... I'm sorry... Please go back.
Back to your resting place... Back to your world... Place...? World...? We're dead.
We don't have anything like that. But since we've come back
to life like this... we must do what we have to do. What you have to do...? Wait...! Wh-What happened, Sora? What happened between
you and Asuma Sensei?! Let go of me, you jerk! Sora, you don't really believe that Asuma Sensei killed
your father, do you?! You heard him, too, didn't you?! He himself...confessed to it! He betrayed my father and killed him! Asuma Sensei would never
do something like that! Even on order from the Hokage? Huh...? It seems the Third Hokage
was Asuma's father! What's your point? My point is, my father was killed by
the king of the Hidden Leaf! The Land of Fire doesn't
need two kings. Since there are two kings, there will always be sources of conflict
that will continue to fester. That's why my father worked to make it
so there would only be one king... And yet... such a lamentable thing
happened to him... It happened to him because of Asuma... who chose the other king! The other king? He was ordered by the Hokage
to assassinate my father. Those under the Hokage
must follow his orders. That's why my father attempted
to bring that king down. Even so, that's no reason to attack
Grandma Tsunade, right?! I'm such an idiot... After all, I was happy to hear the man
who killed my father tell me that he died admirably... And I was glad that you
seemingly cleared that up, old man! And here I even thought
I wouldn't need revenge... I even thought revenge would
stain my father's life. I thought that way! And yet... Sora... But... but...I can't imagine
the Old Man Third Hokage would make Asuma Sensei
do something like that! How can you be so sure?! Well...! The same goes for you!
How can you be so sure that's true?! After all, you didn't know that Asuma Sensei was
your father's enemy, right? Who did you hear that from anyway? That's not your concern! Don't tell me you're connected with
those guys causing this trouble... and intend to wipe out the Hidden Leaf. No! I haven't heard anything about that! He wouldn't take things that far... He? This fight will get rid of
the Hidden Leaf king... People other than the king
and Asuma weren't supposed to be... Then what is all this trouble?! That's why...
I'm trying to go find that out! I know...your loneliness. I really understand the feelings
you hold dear. I had seriously started thinking
I wanted to be friends with you. Who are you going to believe?
Us? Or... Wait, Sora! Long time no see, boy. You... I will be your opponent. This time for sure
your lips will be mine... You guys... Sorry, Asuma... I don't have the time to be
getting nostalgic over this reunion. Don't tell me you're going
to use the Limelight... Tou'u! Seito! Nauma! I won't let you interfere! Kitane... I have no choice. Since I've been brought back to life
with the Reanimation Jutsu, I can't disobey the Jutsu caster. I'll kill anyone who interferes...
Even if that person was once a friend! Here I go! You sure got old...Asuma! Asuma Senpai! Asuma Sensei! We heard from Konohamaru... Who's he? He's Kitane, a former member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve from one of the hidden tombs
you guys were pursuing! What did you say?! The other three have also
been brought back to life. A Reanimation Jutsu?!
Using such an advanced Jutsu... So where are the remaining three? They are on the move to the eastern,
western and southern parts of the village. Why are they moving in
scattered directions? Those four were the most powerful
Lightning Style users of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. They're probably intending to
cast Limelight, extolled as the greatest skill
of all Lightning Style Jutsu. What in the world is the Lime...light? Limelight is a Jutsu in which
four people surround an area from the east, west,
south and north and incinerate that space
in an instant. The village will be wiped out
the moment the four are in position... No way... What do we do? Don't let the other three get
into position. The Jutsu won't activate
if we can stop even one of them. Go, Yamato, Sakura! I'll handle this somehow!
You guys stop the remaining three. - Right!
- Understood! Now having said that,
I've got to do my best somehow... You've always been like that. The less chance you had of winning, the more you would demonstrate
your power... Kitane, you would only tackle
something after careful calculation... Yeah. But now I have no choice. I can't disobey the Jutsu caster. Die, Asuma! Water Style: Mouth of the Serpent! Now it's the Water Style? That's right!
She can control several properties! This is not good... After water comes... That's right! The god of lightning... What's going on here?! Aren't the reinforcements here yet? You guys are pathetic! We've got to handle this somehow
on our own. That's right!
We are Shinobi of the Hidden Leaf. Complaining is not allowed! That being said,
they keep endlessly popping up. We've got to defeat the source
of the Jutsu. At this rate, the village will be covered
with the dead... This is endless... That's for sure... At any rate,
what's Shikamaru doing? He should be doing something
about this situation! This is terrible. Looking at our situation, the enemy can come and go
as they please through the barrier. Which means... is it really necessary for them
to go to the trouble of concentrating their forces
on the main gate and attempting to break through
from the front in such a showy way? In other words...it's a diversion? Another unit might already be
in operation elsewhere... We've got trouble!
The village is going to get burnt to a crisp! It's him...! It's...that Jutsu again... Exactly... I can't believe...you're still alive... Too bad. This time I'll kill you without fail. What's this...? Oh my. And here I was looking forward
to a reunion with that guy from before... I hate little girls! Oh no. What's this chill...? You annoy me! You're going to wind up getting
roasted whole, either way. But shall I make you first, boy? Lightning Style: Earth Flash! It's about time...
for those lips to be mine... What's the matter, Asuma?! Weren't you going to stop me? If you don't come at me like you mean it,
the village will be destroyed. Show me that you can stop me, Asuma! Die! Where are you?!
Come out! I want to talk! Over here! Yo! Furido! I want to talk to you. Well, hold on now. Take a look at the Hidden Leaf Village... Isn't the flashing beautiful? Huh? What're those lights...? Oh... When the four lights are all in place,
the Hidden Leaf Village will be no more. Are you really going to wipe out
the Hidden Leaf Village?! Yeah... I'm going to burn... the Hidden Leaf to death... with the light! We've received a report from
a messenger. It seems the attempt to stop
the ever-increasing dead has failed and it's only a matter of time before the defense perimeter
is broken through... What's happening with
the reinforcements? I've already send Kiba, Ino,
Choji and Lee... But it seems they're vastly outnumbered. Unlike us, the enemy is tireless,
after all... This long drawn-out battle
will continue for us unless we can defeat
the Jutsu casters... Lady Tsunade, could you please
send me to the front line? Next time:
"Everyone's Struggle to the Death."


 Are you...really...going to
kill everyone in the village? Yeah. Every single one. It will allow us to achieve the restoration
of the Land of Fire. Wasn't removing
the Land of Fire king... your, I mean, my father's cause? Why do people totally uninvolved
have to die?! They are involved. As long as there are people alive
who believe in the Hokage, the Land of Fire cannot become one. Do you understand? Your father was killed by Asuma
who believed in the Hokage. The king isn't the problem. The problem is those
who believe in the king. As long as they're around, a king can be replaced
over and over again. That's where your father
was mistaken... Mistaken...? It's not the king that needs
to be gotten rid of. It's the pawn! The king can be crushed only after
eradicating everyone in the village. Then the Land of Fire
can truly be unified. Limelight... When the four sources
of lightning come together, everything goes back to zero. That is the time when all
our aspirations... will be fulfilled. Fouka, Fuen, Fudo.
Protect their paths. Protect the paths of
the dead Jutsu casters... Kitane, Nauma, Tou'u and Seito. Once the preparations for
the Limelight have been completed, we will get out of the village. Along with you. Everyone's Struggle
to the Death


 It appears the trick lies in
that mountain of dirt! You're right. They summoned the earth from
the villages they attacked over these past several days
along with the buried villagers. So they're bringing the buried villagers
back to life one after another with a Reanimation Jutsu, huh? Give me a break. How the heck many people
did they kill? Expansion Jutsu! Arm! This is endless. There's so many of them. At this rate, the village will be buried
with the dead. The number of enemy units
is continuing to grow. The reinforcement unit has joined up, but it is all they can do to keep
the enemy from advancing to the shopping district. I see... Fifth Hokage,
please let me go to the field. I won't be able to come up with anything
by trying to work this out in my head. It's not in my nature. Fine... I'll do what I can. I'm counting on you. Yes, ma'am. You look good like that... You courageous boy... I can save you if you give
that body of yours to me. I don't have a single thing
to give you! Beat it, you old hag! I see... You horrible kid... Furido told me to keep you alive... But everyone makes mistakes. Lightning Style:
Electric Needle Spark! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Tenacious, as expected. I can't afford to be wasting time here. Then I'll settle things for you! Die! Wood Style: Domed Wall! Stop hiding! That's right... You're also an Earth Style user... Then let's find out...who's better. Earth Style: Falling Earth Spears! It seems my body was
a bit harder than rock. What is this place? Anyway, I've got to get out of here. No! Stop! Can't you forget about this? No, I can't... I liked you. Me, too. And yet... I never thought...
I'd have to kill you... Lightning Style: Lightning Bind! I won't bother. I'll let you live. I don't have the time to
be dealing with you... Kitane! Wait... Kitane... Soon, they should be arriving
at the Promised Land for the activation of Limelight... No! I won't let you... kill the people of this village! I won't let you... kill the people of this village! I hate Asuma...
But what you are doing, it's... So you're just like your father, huh? Wha--?! You jerk... You're pathetic, Sora. This is what happens
when those shunned by others... are treated a little kindly... What did you say? It was the same with
your father, too... I will smash all of that foolishness! It is exactly that naïve thinking
that ruins the Land of Fire! It's what gives life to this village
and kills those with a soul! Am I right? Do you want to die
like your father did?! Sakura... Sakura. Naruto? You're okay now, Sakura. What about the enemy? The walls were covered with moths... And they attacked me... It's okay, Sakura. You must've had
quite a frightening experience. But don't worry... I'll set your mind at ease. Why are you running? You don't have to run away. - Die, Sakura.
- Come on, Sakura. - Wait!
- Don't run. - Stop it!
- Hurry up and die! Stop! At this rate, the number of injured
will only continue to grow.  We've got to find
a fundamental solution to this... How's the battle situation, Ino? Shikamaru. She passed out from the illusion
caused by the poisonous moths. I wonder what kind of dream
she's having. Well, nightmares suit little girls... Release! Goodbye, little girl. A Substitution? Goodbye, you sick jerk! H-How did you escape my Jutsu? The instant I heard your voice... I could pretty much guess
what you were going to do. There was the poisonous spider
in the labyrinth before. And this time,
you used poisonous moths. I anticipated your attack pattern
and was prepared with a counter. You gave yourself an antidote? You're evasive and
were never even on the battlefield. The outcome of this fight was determined
from that moment on. What? The defense barrier... It's vanishing... If the barrier is broken... then has a detached unit
defeated the Jutsu caster? Even if that's the case, the situation won't change
if these guys don't go away. Even so, the detached units
are very doing well! We've got to take care of things
on our end, too! Well said, Choji! Shikamaru! This is a diversion. The enemy's objective is
probably elsewhere! We've got to take care of things here
as quickly as possible and go back up the detached units. We know that. Stop complaining and come up
with a strategy! What a slave driver! Choji! You've got
some Chakra saved up, right? Yeah, all set. I can go anytime! What about the rest of you guys? I'm fit as a fiddle and ready to go! I won't give in to youngsters! I was just thinking
I wanted to rampage like crazy! Yeah, us too! Y-Yeah. Okay then, let's go! It's still too soon to
go beddy-bye, boy. Earth Style: Mud Silhouette! Water Style: Mouth of the Serpent! The earth gains momentum from
the water and turns into a mudslide. Eat this! Let's fight for real already. Or are you going to
just run around forever? I'm not just running. What? I was just waiting for the right conditions
for a counterattack. Water Style: Ripping Torrent! Water Style?! I should've been on alert for
the Water Style from a Wood Style user... But I won't be beaten so easily. You tilled the ground just right for me. Sandy soil, when broken down
into fine particles, absorbs water and liquefies
a lot easier. You jerk...
That was your plan from the start? I don't need to take part in
an Earth Style battle to beat you. Wood Style: Tree Bind Eternal Burial! Wh-What's this?! Become soil in the Leaf Village,
Earth Style user. Nooo! Go, Choji! Expansion Jutsu. Human Boulder! Next! Here I go! Severe Leaf Hurricanes! Next! Man Beast Clone. What the heck is this?! Black clouds cover the sky and
roars of thunder reverberate. The Hidden Leaf is close
to total destruction. Friends scramble to avoid
the impending crisis. Yet, there is another impending crisis
amidst the chaos. The secret of Sora's origin will
at last be revealed. Sora stands frozen in shock as Furido
reveals more about his terrible plan... Next time:
 "Moment of Awakening."


 What the...? The Reanimation Jutsu is wearing off. This means the other squads
defeated the enemies, right? Yeah... Maybe. Then we can finally rest easy. I wouldn't say that... What? Hooray! We did it!
All their Jutsu have ended! We kept Hidden Leaf Village safe! Not yet, as Shikamaru says, if this is all a diversion,
it's too soon to rest easy. Now...what about the Jutsu
Konohamaru told us about that could burn down the village? Didn't Yamato and Sakura head
to Azuma Sensei's place? Any word from Sakura? None... That's not good. Shikamaru! Huh? It seems the situation in the village
remains critical... so the end of the Reanimation Jutsu
was just another trick... used to lull us into
a false sense of security. So we need to find
Sakura and Yamato, or the enemies themselves, right? Exactly. So get the staff together,
and go investigate the village! Roger. - Limelight...
- Limelight... Damn it! Those three are in position... Once Kitane gets to
the village, it will...! Moment of Awakening


 Sora! Surpass your father! Crush him! You have that power. Show the power you were
chosen to have, not Kazuma! Shut up! The village! Asuma! Your father! That's right! The pathetic father! Huh?! If you insult my father any more... If I insult him, what will you do? I won't forgive you! You won't forgive me?! So what! My father's belief...
had nothing to do with massacre. I'll... I'll stop you! Massacre?
Isn't that why you were born? What? What are you talking about? Look. That hand. Oh?! That hand...
it looks just like a monster's! - Monster! Monster!
- Monster! Monster! Monster... You were finished too easily,
little boy. How dare you...
how dare you do such a thing to me! Damn... I won't forgive you! Reaper Transfer! What the--?!
The wound is healed already! Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu! You're mine! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Too slow! There's no point making clones
if the real one gets caught. Your diversion isn't doing any good. It's not a diversion...
the real one is the bait! Rasengan! I did it! No, not yet... What's with her?! What's going on...? How dare you do that
to my body! And not just once, but twice! Reaper Transfer! You're not an average little boy. The wound again. She's...! Water Style: Storm Upheaval! Water... Crap, after water comes?! Earth Style: Mud Silhouette! Earth? Thunder Style works better
on a wet opponent... So why did she...? Wait a second! when I hit her with Rasengan, she used the Thunder Style! Then when she scratches the arm,
it's Water Style. I see now...
She must be... Are you switching bodies?! That's why so many elements... Nothing will come of that knowledge. Water Style: Mouth of the Serpent! Reaper Transfer! Earth Style: Mud Silhouette! I can't allow anyone
who knows my secret to live. In exchange, I'll be taking your body.
Or do you wanna die? Give me a break! Huh? I won't let you get away with this! Enough of you're bluffing! Damn you! Earth Style: Stone Column Spear! How dare you...my hair! Take this! Sora... Come to think of it... Your Chakra is wind-natured, isn't it? There aren't many people
with that nature, so I need to restock. Reaper Kiss... I'll make your vast power all mine! Her body changed,
but the blood is still there. What a weird Jutsu. Wait a sec... Wh-What are you doing? I finally figured it out. The truth behind your Jutsu. This! Bastard! It was the same then, too! You were more concerned
with your hair than your body. There must be some secret
about your hair! Now that it's come to this... I will take your body! I'll...suck you...! You freaking... How dare you... What's the heck...is this?! Shadow Clone--! I won't let you this time! Rasengan! What a monster... Sora! Wait for me! Wind Style: Jade Hurricane You know about
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, right? The real monster that
attacked this village and almost completely annihilated it? The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit...? There are different types of
monsters called Tailed Beasts. We humans have sought them
since ancient times. All for the sake of obtaining
the massive amounts of power they have... and using them... as ultimate weapons! Those who obtained
a Tailed Beast, gained immense power that
could be used to seize the world. All the countries conducted
various experiments and finally found a way to control
the Tailed Beasts... by sealing them
inside human bodies. What?! People with a Tailed Beast sealed
in their bodies are called Jinchuriki. And each country has made
desperate efforts to obtain them. And it was here in
the Hidden Leaf Village that we had a chance to obtain
a Jinchuriki. It was fifteen years ago... The Fourth Hokage sealed
the Nine-Tailed Beast attacking the Hidden Leaf
into a baby. And the Leaf gained a Jinchuriki! But Leaf's chance was
our chance as well. We managed to harvest
some of the Chakra that was expelled from
the Nine-Tailed Beast! However, that Chakra couldn't
be sealed right away... and it took five years to
implant it into a boy. So, you're saying... Yes! It's you, Sora! You are that simulated Jinchuriki! Since when... Even though
you're not a true Jinchuriki, you should have almost equal
the power of a real one! Since when?! Since the beginning. Since the beginning,
you were born to bring death. You are the weapon we created. No way... You probably don't remember... but right after the Chakra was
sealed in your body, you couldn't control it and
went berserk. You ramped around, and even destroyed
the Fire Temple's Iron Wall Seal. Me? Because of that... I've been totally alone and hated... and never had any comrades? Kitane... Rat, Dog, Rat, Tiger, Horse,
Horse, Ram... Dog, Dragon, Rat, Rat, Tiger,
Dragon, Rabbit, Monkey, Monkey... Rat, Dog, Rat, Tiger, Horse,
Horse, Ram... The two kings... What does the king really
mean to us, after all? Asuma... Do you know...
who the king is? Of course. It's the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Fire or the Hokage. But I think we should only
have one king to protect... Dad. Gee, it seems you still don't get it. I probably felt the same way
as Kazuma back then. I understand that. I just couldn't go along with his ideas. Now...you have your answer? Maybe. Next time...
I'll leave it all up to you. Earth Style...
combined with Reanimation Jutsu... Sora! Come on, your job is waiting. You and I will get very busy. The scent of earth... It's coming from the north... They got you, Kitane. So in that case, I think the other three should be
washed up by now. Limelight failed. Then...the village will be... Now that it's come to this,
you'll have to do it. I'll completely release
the Sealing Jutsu. Release! That's... Sora... Sora...! The defense barrier and
the Reanimation Jutsu have been broken and the area around the main gate
is returning to normal. I see. It seems everyone
maneuvered well. And what about the Jutsu
Asuma reported, that burns down villages? That was also prevented
before the fact. Now we have completely
smashed the enemy's diversion as well as their probable main operation. That's right. Now all that's left
are the enemy remnants...huh?! What's the matter? What's that red light? Next time: "Despair."


 Lady Tsunade. The defense barrier and
the Reanimation Jutsu have been broken and the area around the main gate
is returning to normal. Also, the enemy Jutsu that
burns down villages in an instant, from Asuma's report, was also stopped
before it could be executed. I see... What's... that red light...? What?! Sora! Despair


 Asuma Sensei... What the heck is that?! I don't know... Very nice, Sora! Get angry! Hate! Turn that anger
and hate into power! Thrash all the people
of the Hidden Leaf! Drive them to death! Knock it off! I...wasn't born to do... ...something like that. Yes, you were. It is all for the sake of true unification
for the Land of Fire. Your power is
now required, Sora. What the heck
are you talking about? You... Asuma! Kazuma! No way... You... Asuma Sensei... Do you know this guy? Yeah... He used to be a fellow member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. You...! What the heck
did you do to Sora?! All I did was take your leftovers. What did you say? Sora...is just like you... Stop! Sora! Naruto! What is this pain...? Am I really... becoming... the Nine-Tails? How...in the world
did you do that to Sora? You know more about
the Nine-Tail's attack on the Hidden Leaf than me. Back then, the Nine-Tails
was sealed inside a baby... at the cost of
the Fourth Hokage's life. The Hidden Leaf
obtained the Nine-Tails and we couldn't afford to miss
that opportunity. After the Nine-Tails
went on its rampage, we obtained the scattered Chakra. We cultivated it and then implanted it
in Sora five years later. You... Sora is your... So what? The Hidden Leaf had obtained
a significant power. We also wanted to obtain such a power
in order to protect the king. What's wrong with that? Naruto... I knew...
That's right. I knew... And yet...I... I knew that was...
that was Sora's voice...crying out... And yet...why wasn't I able
to pick up on that? And here I was the only one... who could understand
his pain and his cries... It was the same
back then, too... The eyes around Sora...
watching him... Those cold and repulsive eyes... As if they were saying,
"Get out of here." I knew...they were the same! The same as those eyes
watching me... Naruto... The eyes of the adults looking at me,
as if wanting to stab me to death... It's those same eyes. What does that matter now? Those eyes! The eyes that only saw us
as monsters. Isolated us. And on top of that, you try to use us
at your own convenience. It's like the time with Gaara... Why don't you adults even attempt
to think about how we feel? And moreover, Sora... Sora... Why was it necessary to put
this monster inside him?! Why? Why do this to Sora? Shut up... Naruto! Sora... Stay away! You all stay away from me... No! I won't be tricked any more. You killed my father... and then try to befriend me
like nothing happened. Special power, my foot!
You tricked me! Sora! I told you to stay away! And when all is said and done, you're also just one
of the Hidden Leaf! I can't trust you! What...? Wh-What's going on...?
Nine-Tail's Cloak...on Sora... Don't tell me Sora's cells
are merging with the Nine-Tails... What's this...? What in the world has begun here? Unlike the Jinchuriki there, the Nine-Tails Chakra is too massive
for Sora's body. Therefore, I continued to suppress
the Nine-Tails Chakra with a Sealing Jutsu for
these past ten years. However...with the Nine-Tails Chakra
now having been released, the balance has been lost and
Sora's body is being taken over. Once the Nine-Tails has
formed all nine tails, Sora will literally turn into
the Nine-Tails. Only then will the imitation
Nine-Tails become the real thing. You jerk! Then...
I'll turn over this body to that fox! Sora... In exchange... I'll smash...this world! Stop it, Sora! Wood Style! Domed Wall! Naruto. Sakura! Naruto! Asuma. Captain Yamato! What was the red light
from before? That's...the Nine-Tails? No doubt about it. It's the Nine-Tail's Cloak. That's...Sora. What did you say? Very nice, Sora. More. Revel more of your power! Stop it, Sora!
Don't use that power! Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You're late, Shikamaru. Is it them? Don't underestimate
my and Akamaru's noses! It's not just Sora. Asuma Sensei and Naruto
are also with him. And there's the scent of
one other person not from the village... An enemy? What's that? Naruto! You okay, Naruto? Yeah... That was a close one, huh? How sorry! I'm your opponent. Kazuma. Captain Yamato! Can't you control
the Nine-Tails Chakra like you did when that happened to me?! I can control your Nine-Tails Chakra because you have
the First Hokage's necklace. It won't work on Sora,
he doesn't have a necklace. Sora... Is that so...? Am I that much of a hindrance?!
You don't need me?! Huh?! You're wrong, Sora! We just don't want you
to use that power... I am...one with this power... This power is the only thing
I can trust now. Sora... I'll have revenge on all of you guys
who drove me to loneliness! Naruto! I'm sick of people getting hurt...
with this power... Back then...I hurt Sakura... You're the one
who hurt Sakura, Naruto. You'll end up tormenting yourself if you rely on
the power of the Nine-Tails. And it could turn into a power
that hurts your friends. That's why... That's why I don't want you hurting
anyone with that power! You don't know
anything about me! Yes, I do! The origin of the Nine-Tails
you've been implanted with... is sealed inside me! What're you...talking about? I'm a Jinchuriki. What're you...saying? Sora... Stay back... I won't be... I won't be tricked by those words! The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success! Shikamaru, Choji! Ino! They've come... Damn it! More friends, huh?! I'm counting on you, Choji! Right. Partial Expansion Jutsu! Both hands! Damn it! You two! He did it. Now he won't get away. Something's not right. If you've got the Nine-Tails
sealed inside you... why do you have so many friends? I was all alone the whole time... And yet, why...why do you...? It was the same with me, too. When I was little,
I was always by myself. But I didn't have
the time to be lonesome. I wanted to get everyone
to acknowledge me. And these are the friends I made. I have no friends like that... I'm...these guys are all your friends! Aww... Choji...! Ino. I know. Ninja Art:
Mind Transfer Jutsu! Did she do it? What's wrong, Ino? Are you okay? Ino! What happened with
the Mind Transfer? There was no...
human consciousness inside him... What did you say?! I've reached my limit, too. Oh no! It's his third tail... Captain Yamato!
Something's wrong with Naruto! Don't tell me the Nine-Tails Chakra
has leaked out... No way...! Don't tell me he's going to
rampage at a time like this! Why is this happening? And when Naruto's wearing
the First Hokage's necklace... Things seem to be
different this time. Damn it. What's going on? Stabilize


I can't believe... my Jutsu won't work at all! Next time: "Resonance"

 Oh no! It's his third tail... Resonance


 Sora... Sora! - Naruto! Look out!
- Naruto! Naruto! - Damn it...!
- Is he okay? I can't believe Sora's consciousness... I can't believe Sora's not in there... Give me a break! Sora has flipped at last.
Nobody can stop him now. Kazuma... You jerk! Wood Style Jutsu! Such destructive force...! Stop it, Sora! Shadow Strangle Jutsu! - I knew it wouldn't work!
- Let me try! Choji! Leave it to me.
I'll heal him. Damn it! For crying out loud, wake up! Kazuma... Why did you do this?! You are his real father... Why?! You implanted the Nine-Tails in Sora
in order to use him as a tool for killing! Do you know what that means? It's all for my will... I will put him to good use
for my dream! Knock it off! I'll go! Jerk! Fang Over Fang! Damn it! You no longer have
a cause left to speak of! My dream is to make sure
the Land of Fire stays as it is. There's nothing wrong with that! Then what about your child's...
Sora's dreams? What was your dream as
the son of the Third Hokage? I... I protected the king. And you did, too.
Isn't that good enough? Indeed... I'm protecting a king... But it's not the king
you've got in mind! There you go.
It's the same with you, too. It doesn't matter who the king is. When all is said and done, we're just pawns and
all we can do is protect the king. But a pawn isn't strong enough
to protect a king. That's why I turned Sora
into what he is. A monster pawn that has advanced
into enemy territory to take out your king. Children aren't pawns
for protecting a king! That doesn't make any difference. As long as we're pieces,
all we can do is take the other's king. How it's done isn't important. Even if you somehow
turned the board around... I'd still win! Wood Style Jutsu! Damn it... Why side with an outsider?! He's not an outsider.
He's a member of Team Kakashi. He's one of us... Sora. Hey. Remember, Sora! Back then, you acted like an idiot and I tried to stop you from thrashing
about like this! I guess there's no choice! - Did he get him?!
- Naruto! Sora! Sora! Come back!
I know you're in there, Sora! Sora. Sora. Stop, already! Get away from Sora... Naruto! Sora! Hey, Sora! Come back! Sora! Sora...? You... - What...?!
- Huh...?! Wh-What's going on here? The Nine-Tails Chakra, by itself...?! Now! STABILIZE


Hokage Style: Elder Jutsu!
10th Edict on Enlightenment! What's happening here? It's never like this. It's coming...from the outside... Naruto...! Damn it... Don't come out! Why...?! Coincidence sure plays
funny tricks on you. Fouka said that. Furido... About that kid with
the pointy hair I fought against... I wonder if he might kind of
be like Sora somehow... She said he and Sora
might be connected. It's the Chakra from
the same Nine-Tails after all. The rage of Sora's Nine-Tails is
resonating with the real Nine-Tails. What?! Isn't this interesting?!
Now the true Jinchuriki... No, the Nine-Tailed monster fox
will be set in motion and once again destroy the village! Damn it! Damn it! Don't do this...!
Stop, Sora! Sora! D-Don't tell me! Wh-What's that...?! This is not good!
Run, guys! Naruto! Sakura...! Sora! Wake up! Hey! That's the way, Sora! Smash the Hidden Leaf to pieces! No way... Sora... Naruto?! Heck no! No way am I going to let
the Nine-Tails jerk take me over! What's that?! Very nice! Keep it up, Sora! I didn't call you...!
Beat it, monster fox...! Don't just show up on your own...! Captain Yamato,
can't something be done about this?! No. My Jutsu won't work
on Naruto now. We can only have faith
in his mental strength. But! Damn it...! Leave it to me...boy. I refuse...! I won't run away! I won't be overtaken by
the likes of a monster fox! Naruto... Naruto... Damn it...! I made a vow... I will not...be...taken over...
by you anymore. I must not do the same thing
I lectured Sora about... Why do you hesitate?
Just say it like always! Say, "Loan me your power." Knock it off! Sora, I'll get you back
with my own hands! Naruto... Sora... Who's that...? Sora! Come back! Get back here!
Are you going to sleep forever? Wake up, already! Wake up! Sora! Who's that? Who's there? Oh, it's me... When I was little...
I was always crying... I was all alone. Sora... Who...? Whose voice is that? Sora... I knew it... Just as I thought... Nothing's changed. I'm still...alone... Sora... Hang on!
I'll save you now...! Hang on, Sora. Whose voice is that...? Sakura! I can't heal Choji's wound
with my Medical Ninjutsu... Just as I thought... It's like the time when
Sakura got hurt. It takes longer for wounds inflicted
by Nine-Tails Chakra to heal... - Huh?
- Even after proper treatment... a sharp needle-like pain
will linger on the wound. So what then?! Does that mean Naruto's the only one
who can control him?! Unfortunately, that would
seem to be the case. No way... All we can do is believe in Naruto... Next time: "My Friend"


 You keep out of this! I'll...save Sora! My Friend


 So Sora has impressed
the real Jinchuriki, huh? Return Sora to normal. There's nothing I can do now. Soon Sora will break loose
and the Hidden Leaf will be destroyed. I won't let that happen! Try and stop him! No way am I getting mixed up in this... You're not getting away! Sora! I got rid of him...
I got rid of the Nine-Tails jerk... And I did it by borrowing your power... This time I'll loan you my power... Don't hold back! Sora! For crying out loud...
wake up already! Naruto! You okay?! Hang in there, Naruto.
I'll heal you now... She doesn't have time
to be healing him! Sakura! Get out of there! Run, everyone! Are you okay, guys?! - Yeah...
- We're okay... Come to think of it,
what about Sakura and Naruto? Naruto! Sakura. You okay?! Y-Yeah... That's good... More importantly,
I need to heal you, Naruto! You, more than anyone, should know how quickly
my wounds heal. Anyway, I'll get Sora back,
no matter what. Take care of his wounds... Naruto... Okay. Sora... - Naruto!
- I'll be okay! You get back to the others.
This is between Sora and me... Right... How's it going? My Medical Ninjutsu
can't heal it. Just as I thought... It's like the time when you got hurt... It takes longer for wounds inflicted
by Nine-Tails Chakra to heal. A sharp needle-like pain
will still linger on the wound. I'll be okay. So what then?! Does that mean Naruto is
the only one who can control him?! That would seem to be the case. No way! Naruto... If I had made sure
I defeated you back then... this wouldn't have happened to Sora. You should be glad. That you weren't the one
to kill Sora's father. No, It'll be me...
This time for sure I'll... Still on the Hokage's order? No! It's unforgivable! I can't forgive you for doing that
to your own child! What's with all this parent
and child stuff you're talking about? Will stuff like that change
the Land of Fire? It won't change it.
It will make it come together. Sorry, but I'm going
to change this land! And the world! In order to do that, a king is necessary! You're wrong! You're the one who's wrong! Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll Damn it! What's this?! You sneak out of the hospital
in the middle of the night for a stroll? I couldn't get to sleep with
the clamor in the village... Oh, well. Now then... I can have a nice leisurely conversation
with you, Kazuma. I've got nothing to say to you. Sora. That hurts! Remember, Sora... Remember...when we first met... Remember when we accidently
got into a scuffle with each other... Remember when you came to help me... Sora... Sora. Sora! Sora! Damn it... We were mistaken from the start. Mistaken about what a king
refers to in the first place. We weren't mistaken. We weren't mistaken, Asuma! If I... If I die...what will happen
to the Land of Fire? Nothing will happen. That's funny... I don't remember my dad's face
very well. But even now, I can never forget
that spotless clean breechcloth. To me, my dad is that clean white cloth. Kazuma... Your cause was... Sora! Sora. Who's that?! Sora. Oh, it's Naruto... Let's just calm down now and... Let's discuss this... Hey!
You're hitting me with your punches! Man, this guy's so loud... You okay...Sora? Naruto...! You jerk! What're you doing
sticking your nose in this?! As long as I'm here,
I have no choice. He's so meddlesome... Hey, what happened, Sora? What happened between
you and Asuma Sensei?! Let go of me, you jerk! Such an annoyance. What is it now?! What in the world is happening up here? This must be... Captain Yamato!
Sora is acting different from Naruto... That's right. This is just a theory, but I don't think Sora has the capacity
to house the Nine-Tails Chakra. The massive amount of Chakra
that has gathered up is now attempting to escape
from Sora's body. That means... Sora...that power... That power won't do you any good. I will... all of us in the Hidden Leaf
will become your... We'll become your power! Naruto! Lady Tsunade... Shizune! We're going out! Y-Yes, ma'am! What's this...?
Is this the Nine-Tails? What an enormous amount of Chakra. What?! What's happening? Something's not right. Captain Yamato! Although it has escaped
from Sora's body, it probably needs a vessel
to maintain its form. Then... Sora! You okay, Sora?! Hey! Can you hear me? Wake up, Sora! Sora! Who's there...? Somebody's calling...
calling me again. Sora! Shut up, Naruto! Oh, you're finally awake! Naruto... Now, let's go home, Sora. Go home... Where am I supposed
to go home to? What're you saying?
The Hidden Leaf Village, of course. The Hidden Leaf... You mean
the Hidden Leaf I tried to destroy... That doesn't matter!
You're our friend! It doesn't matter what people say.
We're friends! - Friends...
- That's right! - He looks okay.
- I'm glad... Sai! Would you guys include me, too? Heck no. What?! No way. What was so funny
about that just now? Friends, huh...? Then you're not going back
to the Temple of Fire? Nope. I want to see more of the world
and meet all kinds of people... And little by little,
I want to make friends like you have. I see... But make sure you stop by
once in a while. The Hidden Leaf Village
will always welcome you... That's right.
Don't hesitate. Thanks... See you around. Say "Hi!" to Old Man Asuma for me. Sure! Oh... Come to think of it,
next time for sure... I'll give you a posthumous name. You jerk. I just heard that's a name
you give to dead people! Took you long enough, you idiot.
See you! That's a first for you, going with a climbing silver
right off the bat. Let's take it nice and slow.
We've got the time, after all. It's an advance guard for
breaking through the enemy's defense. Sometimes you have to be able
to make moves like this. I thought you didn't like moves like that.
Just like me. Sacrifice is required in order to protect
the king when your opponent is skilled. Is something the matter? It's nothing... I just now started to understand
the importance of the "king." Well... The game is over if
you get your king taken in Shogi. If you were to liken the Hidden Leaf Shinobi
to a Shogi piece... Shikamaru...
In the end, you would be a knight. Why? Although weak in strength, a knight can advance
by jumping over pieces. This unique movement resembles
your flexible thinking. Then what would you be? I'm nothing.
I'm just... A sacrificial piece...huh? Then...do you know who the "king" is? The Hokage, right? That's what I thought until just recently... But it's not like that. Then who is it? You'll understand when the time comes. You dodge well... My attack speed is the slowest
in the Akatsuki. I just can't hit anything, can I? I see...
I knew you guys were Akatsuki... You're the only one left. Well, you're pretty good. Hey, Hidan. She's the Two-Tailed Jinchuriki.
You'll die if you get careless. Don't give me that, Kakuzu! I'd like her to kill me anyway. Lady Tsunade, the report from Kakashi, who made contact with
Lord Jiraiya, has returned. Oh, finally. And? Right. It seems he verified attacks
by what looks like the same pair of Shinobi in seven locations
in five neighboring lands. A pair...? Yes. Although invasion
into the Land of Fire has not yet been confirmed,
it's only a matter of time... I see... So they've finally gone
into action, huh? Next time:
"The Quietly Approaching Threat"


 I sure was young...
back then... Good work...
on the Feudal Lord escort. What's your beef?! I protected the king, the Feudal Lord
just as you told me to do! Why don't you even attempt
to acknowledge me?! King...huh...? How about acknowledging me
at least a little bit, Dad?! You don't understand... how difficult and important a battle
to protect the king is. I understand that people died. But sacrifice comes with
a Shinobi mission. You can't possibly
understand now... the true significance of
protecting the king. You just don't want to
acknowledge me! Now I get the feeling... I kind of understand what
you were talking about. I'm sorry I left the Hidden Leaf...
and just did whatever I wanted. I have no regrets, though. Now I feel like it wasn't so bad
being born into the Sarutobi Clan. You properly fulfilled your duty
as leader of the village... You were a cool dad... The Quietly
Approaching Threat 

 Heave ho, heave ho... heave ho... Carrying lumber is a mission, too! Let's do our best to carry it.
Heave ho... Whoa! Wh-What's the matter? L-Let's take a little break. We're not used to this kind of work. You guys are a sorry bunch. The village has been saved and
the Fifth Hokage was unharmed. But that was because of the great efforts
by Brother Naruto and the others... We have to do our best with
whatever we can do, so we'll also be able to
support the village! Well said. You guys are the ones who will support
the Hidden Leaf in the next generation. And it seems Naruto played a huge role
in the earlier incident. Iruka Sensei. I'm happy to
have such amazing students. Konohamaru. I'm okay now. If we all work together,
we'll be okay no matter what happens. Next! Next! - Next!
- Yes! Next! Next! Next! Next! You're too slow! Next! Next, next! Next! What's the matter?!
Where are the next documents?! Oh, uh...that's it...
You're finished! I see. Th-This is a first, isn't it? You don't usually take your work
this seriously, Lady Tsunade. You could say that. It seems there was quite the commotion
over just a couple of thieves... That's pathetic, Princess Tsunade. Just from this... the Hidden Leaf Village will turn
into a laughingstock amongst the surrounding lands
and the Feudal Lord. It seems your orders
are slow in coming and then become forestalled! Your slow decision-making
endangers the village. It's all your responsibility as the Hokage.
Bear this firmly in mind! Those old geezers
and their big mouths... Who knows what they'll say if
unfinished work continues to stack up... Damn it! Oh, that's right. The report from the one who was sent to contact
Lord Jiraiya has arrived. I see. So he's back... You got hospitalized again because
you tried to act cool and snuck out even though your injury hasn't healed yet. It says in this book that the bonds
of friendship grow deeper if you rush to a friend who's in a jam... That's a comic book, right?
You're so random these days. Here... What? It seems women who like
you will feed you. Well, it's not like
I'm testing you or anything... Look you... Sakura. S-Sakura...
I-I can't eat anymore... Oh, but if you insist I eat, then... Eat until you die! Yo! Hm? I-I can't breathe... Sakura fed Naruto an apple... Which means... Oh, for crying out loud! Why can't I have someone normal
on my team?! Huh? Huh? What happened? Attacks by what is suspected to be
the same two-man Shinobi team in seven locations in five
neighboring lands have been verified. Although they have not yet succeeded
in invading the Land of Fire, judging from their line of action,
it's only a matter of time... Lady Tsunade? So the Akatsuki Organization
has gone into action. Let's do this. Hold it. Before doing that... I must pray to my god. You're always
such a pain in the neck. It's a pain
in the neck for me, too. But the commandments are strict,
so I have no choice, do I?! You probably think
you've got me cornered... But you don't. I lured you guys here, you see! Now that I know
you are with the Akatsuki, I cannot let you escape. Oh, man...
We're trapped, Kakuzu... No problem.
Actually, this is favorable for us. In the name of Yugito Ni 'i
of the Hidden Clouds... I'll kill you! Huh...? What? What's up with that,
"I'll kill you," stuff? When people show me all
that enthusiasm and stuff... I start to get irritated. And when I'm irritated,
I become enraged. And when I become enraged... Shut up, Hidan. Okay. okay... But you know,
when I become enraged, I start feeling like, "I don't care about our objective.
I just want to smash everything." Knock it off, Hidan.
The objective is absolute. This mission doesn't go along
with my religion in the first place. The motto of the Jashin religion
is mass slaughter. Leaving people alive goes
against the commandments. From the outset, I'm not inclined
to take part in a mission that breaks
the commandments. I may not look it,
but I'm quite devout! So not being able to kill
is a pain in the neck. So how about we settle this
by talking things over? Talking things over, you say? What's up with this guy? Why don't you
just come quietly? Stop messing around! Huh...? Looks like that's a no. Are you an idiot? Come on. Are you kidding me? What's up with this Jinchuriki? She's totally morphed into a Tailed Beast. Oh man... Uh-oh! Hot! Don't cats have sensitive tongues
for hot stuff? So this is the Two-Tails monster cat
known as the wraith... And I'm a rat in a cage, no less. This is not amusing... Oh-ho. So you made a great showing
while I was gone, huh? Where the heck were you,
Kakashi Sensei? Oh...nowhere special. Asuma Sensei. I knew you'd be here. Kakashi, got a minute? I want to talk to you... Naruto, Sai...
Here, a get well gift! Yikes! I've had enough apples... I hear you checked out what
was happening outside... You could say that... What a nice day. Hm? Yeah...it is. Naruto and Sakura are
coming along very well. And so are Shikamaru,
Choji and Ino... The next generation is
growing up quickly. They'll overtake us just like that... Come on.
I still won't be giving in to them. But this is something the Hidden Leaf
should be very pleased about. So... What did you want to talk about? Hm? Oh, as it happens... There you are...
I finally found you. Kurenai...
Did you need something? I heard Asuma was here, you see... No kidding...? So, Asuma...
What did you want to talk about? Uh, I'll tell you later... Sorry. Now I really want to know... What're you doing, Naruto? I don't have the time to be
lying around here. I need to get back to my training... That being said, you're still... I'm still too weak. That's why... That's exactly why... I have to get stronger
to get power that won't hurt everyone... Power that will protect everyone. That's why I have to get stronger. Naruto... Well, hold your horses... Right now, your training is
to heal those wounds. Kakashi Sensei! And let me make this clear to you,
in particular, Naruto... Huh? If you leave the hospital,
what awaits is training so severe you'll wish you'd stayed
in the hospital longer. So be prepared for that! R-Right...! I-I understand... Okay...
Now he won't push things too far. Sakura... Y-Yes...?! I've got something to take care of.
So I leave the rest to you. What...? Make sure you don't let him
overdo things... Bye! Oh man, isn't he slick! I read the report. Does it look like Naruto will be able
to learn a new Jutsu? How about it? I don't know. No way. I'm not sure... But he can probably do it... That new training approach
is yielding results, after all. And more importantly... He has a clear objective. Sasuke...huh? It's already been thirty minutes.
Aren't you done yet, Hidan? Shut up!
Don't interfere with the ritual! Ouch... Can't you skip some of that perverse praying
you do each and every time? Let's get right to the next one. This is a pain in the neck for me too. But I have no choice
but to follow the commandments. And what do you mean by skip?! That's blasphemy against God! One more to go for our mission. One by one... Next is the Land of Fire. For crying out loud. That Naruto is already starting his training,
even though he's still on the mend. Knowing who he is,
there's no doubt he'll get reckless. Getting stronger through
sheer determination just isn't done anymore. And excessive training could
also have a reverse effect. Not only that, he also has
the physical idiosyncrasy that allows him to work much harder
than other people. The least I can do is help him
in whatever way I can. Next time:
"Akatsuki's Invasion" 

 Zetsu, huh? It appears it's done. Finally finished with
your drawn-out ritual, huh? Nothing but annoying atheist jerks
who don't understand prayer! When you're sad and alone,
you can only trust in yourself. No, you're wrong. You can only trust in money. Oh, here we go! We've fallen behind with
our Jinchuriki hunt mostly because of your side job! I teamed up with you because
you said religion is profitable. I've been left in charge
of Akatsuki finances. Put yourself in my shoes. Money is important. More importantly,
search for the next one immediately. I'll take charge of the Two-Tails. Are you sure you're okay? You were in the hospital until
only yesterday, right? That was just blown
out of proportion! That's enough talking.
Let's continue the training... That's what I'd like to say.
But first let's confirm the basics. Forget about that! Let's hurry up and start the training
for my new knockout Jutsu! The Super Ultra Deluxe Rasengan,
or the Special Naruto Uzumaki Rasengan, or something like that! That's what we're doing Change
in Chakra Nature training for, right? The five basic property types are fire,
wind, water, lightning and earth. And in your case... My Chakra property is wind! Then for the time being, shall we go with what
we've done so far? Right! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Steady and sharp! We did it! How about that, Kakashi Sensei?! Huh? Good grief. He pushes it even though
he's still healing... The Multi Shadow Clone is primarily used as an approach for increasing
the effects of the training. It's not necessary for showing
the results of training. Well, it is Naruto's style, though. Akatsuki's Invasion 


 How deep into the mountains is it? We're almost there. You've been saying that
the whole time! Come on. Give me a break!
We've got to climb again?! What if it turns out
there's no Jinchuriki?! I'll be really upset! I don't give a darn about you.
If you keep wailing like a little kid... I'll kill you. Come on.
Don't give me that, Kakuzu! Oh, man!
What an anti-social jerk. Even if there are several changes... this would be the best plan
under the present conditions, huh? Yes. Get everything compiled and have it ready to transmit
in two or three days. Understood. Sorry to cause you trouble... But we can't just sit around
doing nothing. Are you awake? Huh...? Again... I... You keep resting. Fatigue tends to build up when using the Multi Shadow Clones
training approach. Let's start the training again
after you've rested a little while. What're we going to do next? Next? The next step is... to cut that waterfall! Put your hands on the waterfall
and cut it by hammering it
with your Wind Chakra. Cut...the waterfall? For this training,
you need to instantly create a Change in Chakra Nature
in a large amount of Chakra. Or else you won't be able
to cut the waterfall. You'll more or less be able
to use it in real battle if you can pass this stage of training. Kakashi Sensei! If I can do that, it means I have learned
my first Change in Chakra Nature, right? All right, I'm getting better! I never thought that clumsy Naruto would be able to create
a Change in Chakra Nature so soon. This training approach...
was a big success. Break time is over! Let's get right back to training! Wood Style Jutsu! That will be your training area. Right. But hold on! Whoa... What is it? You'll need Yamato's Chakra control
at all times during this training. I'm counting on you, Yamato. Okay. STABILIZE Preparations complete, Naruto! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Form a mental image
of my Wind Chakra and... Listen up. The Wind Change
in Chakra Nature... splits Chakra in two and
grinds them together. Grinds them together? And then you build up the two Chakra
as if steadily sharpening them. As if steadily...sharpening them... That's right...
The trick is steadier...and sharper. Steady and sharp! Let's go, guys! Right! Damn it! The water should
splash just a bit... Let's go to the next one! Right! As to be expected,
this will probably take a while. Well, be patient. That should be it for the ingredients... Now I can make him some of
my special Sakura Food Pills! I'm sure he'll force himself
into doing more reckless training. Geez... Getting stronger with determination
just isn't done anymore. Not only does excessive training
take a toll on the body, but it could also have
a reverse effect. Not only that, he also has
the physical idiosyncrasy that allows him to work much harder
than other people. That's right! The least I can do
is to help him any way I can. Damn it! Damn... He'll probably start getting
impatient pretty soon. This is a temple.
Is there a Jinchuriki in a place like this? Who knows? But this isn't an ordinary temple,
so there's a good possibility. What was that?! Someone destroyed the Iron Wall Seal! Report this to Lord Chiriku! It doesn't look like these guys
want to convert to the Jashin religion. None of these guys do... That cloak... It's the rumored... No doubt about it! It's the Akatsuki! We have intruders! Who are they? They are with the Akatsuki! I knew they'd come here eventually, but... I'll go!
Everyone else provide backup. Looks like we've got another
virtuous looking one... He's not just virtuous. He's got a 30 million ryo bounty
on his head in our Bingo Book. Hey...
You're not after money, are you? You'll go to hell if you kill
a monk for something like that. Money is the key that opens all doors.
That's just what I want. I don't know what you guys want.
But please leave quietly. No meaningless slaughter, huh? But it doesn't work like that
in my religion. The Temple of Fire is the greatest
Shinobi temple in the Land of Fire. And it is said that all of the monks
control the special power known as the Gift of the Sages. And the 30 million-ryo man is a Ninja who was once chosen as a member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve who protected the Feudal Lord
of the Land of Fire. And the proof is that breechcloth
with the Land of Fire emblem on it... No kidding?
Is he that incredible? Don't get careless.
You'll die. Don't give me that... Kakuzu! What's that?! I don't care.
Let's keep going. You're mine! - Oh.
- Lord Chiriku won! I'll give you a funeral. Who would accept
a different religion's funeral? I'd receive divine retribution
from Lord Jashin... Now I'm mad... Hey...
If this guy isn't a Jinchuriki... I can defend my commandments, right? Do as you like.
But his body is worth money. Don't go overboard...
Make sure he's recognizable. Exchanging life for money
isn't something for people to do... Good grief. Kakuzu! Stay out of this! I'll take care of...this guy! Chiriku of the Temple of Fire will
not lose to wicked men like you! Raikei! Thousand Hand Strike! It appears there was no Jinchuriki here. Let's move on to the next one as soon
as I'm done with my prayer. No... I'm taking this body to trade in for money. Money comes first. Listen, you're really starting
to irritate me. Really... I've got to inform the Hidden Leaf... Then let's get going. The Land of Fire is huge.
Let's take our time. I knew we were falling behind
because of you. Ow! Wait! Hey! Kakashi Sensei! Don't you think I need
more Shadow Clones?! You can't cut the waterfall
unless you perform the Change in Chakra Nature
on a large amount of wind Chakra! The Chakra for each clone will disperse
if there are too many of them! And we can barely line up ten clones
with the width of that waterfall! Do you really want me
to learn this or not Then tell us the trick to get just
a little bit better! You're not holding the Chakra you've built up inside
your body long enough! Take your time and be more efficient! But if we don't get a move on,
this won't be of any use in a real battle. You're in training right now. You don't need to be thinking
about real battles. It will get quicker
once you get used to it. But... Listen... Change in Chakra Nature training
normally takes several years. Under normal conditions,
it takes six months to even cut a leaf. You completed that in only
a few hours. No need to be so impatient. You're progressing several times
faster than we expected. It even took a genius like Sasuke
several days to master the Lightning Change
in Chakra Nature when I taught him the Chidori. MAKE-OUT TACTICS I have to catch up with Sasuke! STABILIZE Good grief... Tenzo... Understood. That was a little tough on you, huh? No! Not at all. N-Not in the least... It was tough... How's that, Naruto?! Now you've got nothing
to gripe about, right?! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Wh-What did you say?
The Temple of Fire was attacked?! It was probably guys from
the Akatsuki. They're going one by one
to locations in the Land of Fire where there might be Jinchuriki. They've come at last. We won't let them out of
the Land of Fire. Contact the twenty newly
formed platoons immediately! Yes, ma'am! I want to know what they're after,
but they are pretty powerful. Destroy them
if they can't be restrained! Next time:
"Under the Starry Sky"


 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Damn it! Hey, don't be so impatient. Your training is going well.
Now it's only a matter of time. If it's just a matter of time, then you should let me
train nonstop. I know you're tough, but... I-I'm ready to go...anytime. I'm okay! C-Captain Yamato...
You're scaring me. Under the Starry Sky


 You carry him for a while. Hey, hey, hey. You're the one always
talking about money. You carry him all the way. He's your precious bounty, right? What's with that look? I'm definitely going to kill you someday. I told you, don't give me that...Kakuzu. Oh, he's doing fine.
I guess he didn't need my food pills. I think he does. Hey!
How long have you been there? Quite a while before you came. No way!
I had no idea... I didn't even sense your presence. I'm sorry. More importantly, that training
is a lot tougher than it looks. Naruto isn't all that skillful
from my viewpoint. He must sustain complete focus while using Shadow Clones
nearly to his limit. The degree of fatigue
must be extraordinary compared to that of normal training. Yes... That's right... That's... BASICS OF
CHANGE IN CHAKRA NATURE

what it said in this book... You didn't have to hide anything. I thought you'd be appalled
to learn... I'm still relying on
the knowledge of books. I knew it... I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant. It's perfectly fine. After all, you read up on it because you're worried
about your friends, right? Books come in handy at times like that. You actually do  have
a nice side to you. What? I'm nice...? Okay, let's go
so we won't interfere with his training. I guess they shaped up into
a good team while I was away. Well, that's good. Naruto! Break the Shadow Clone Jutsu for a bit and mull over the results
of your current training. Accumulate your experience. Right! So? Can you feel it? I've still got a ways to go. I'm going to continue the training... You're overdoing it, I tell you. What's that? Sakura brought it for you. These are food pills...
and there's a note inside. Eat one of my special food pills
and keep up the training. - Sakura Sakura... Sakura's home-made food pills. Let's eat! Sakura, these are totally inedible. Okay, time to continue training!
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! I bet Naruto has been able to
continue training because of my food pills. W-Wow! Naruto! Why don't you take
a little break? I can't catch up to Sasuke
if I throw in the towel now! MEDICINAL HERBS Well, if it isn't Sakura. Oh, Iruka Sensei. Wow, Naruto sure is something else. He did a great job during
the village's dilemma. I did, too! Just kidding. Sorry, sorry. You've become
Lady Tsunade's apprentice, after all. I'm so proud to have had
such excellent students. My drop-out students are
particularly lovable. Even now, Naruto's continuing with
training that only he can do, right? That's really something. I was excellent right from the start. Sorry I wasn't a lovable student. Oh, come on.
You sure are giving me grief today. But he sure got stronger. Yeah. He's changed.
Everyone's changing. My students are growing up
strong and steadfast. What's that? I see... They even got Chiriku, huh...? I was out on patrol... and by the time I returned,
it was too late. It was most likely the guys
from the Akatsuki. They're probably going one by one
to locations in the Land of Fire where there might be a Jinchuriki. Finally they've come. We won't let them out
of the Land of Fire. Contact the twenty newly formed
platoons immediately! That's all I have to say. Does anyone have any questions? What is it? Chiriku, a former member
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, should be there. What happened to him? Lord Chiriku died by their hands. Chiriku was killed?
It can't be... For the pride of the Hidden Leaf,
and most of all, for the safety of the Land of Fire, we must not let them rampage
any further. I want to know what they're after,
but they're very dangerous. Don't let them out of the Land of Fire,
no matter what. Find them without fail and
if you're unable to restrain them, kill them! Go! Dismissed! I will do my best, and I won't bring
shame to the former Team Asuma. We'll do our best,
Shikamaru, Asuma Sensei! Now then... Okay, we'll start with
the Temple of Fire. Someone has to do it. Let's go. Asuma Sensei... What is it? It seems you were acquainted
with Chiriku from the Temple of Fire. Yeah... Didn't I tell you? We used to be brothers-in-arms. It was around the time
when I left the Hidden Leaf and was known as one of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. The Temple of Fire is close.
Let's hurry! The moon sure is beautiful. You're awesome, Sakura! Just what I'd expect from
the girl I knew you'd be! Everyone's changing. That's right. Everyone's changed. Naruto is continuing with
his training that nobody else can do... all to pursue Sasuke. Oh, Naruto... I can only do little things for him. It's not the size of the things
you can do that matters. What's important is the strength
of your feelings for Naruto. A shooting star, huh? Sasuke... Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu. Damn it! Sasuke... As long as I don't give in and keep going without
stopping to rest... I'll arrive at the point where... Here we go! All right! This training is something else, isn't it? Naruto is progressing
so quickly. No... It's not just because
of this training approach. Sasuke has something
to do with it, too. - We cut the waterfall!
- We really cut it! Well done. Now we can start development
of your new original Jutsu. Right... I got it... You okay, Naruto?! I guess he overdid it a little. Wh-What is it? I'm...hungry... You really are...something else. Shizune, have we figured out
what they're up to? Using the twenty platoons, we are currently laying out
a search net with a radius of 150 kilometers around
the border and the Temple of Fire. And...it seems they have not yet
encountered the Akatsuki. Why not? We laid down a search net not
even an ant could crawl through! -Why haven't they been found yet?!
-Well... What about the report from Team Asuma that was heading for
the Temple of Fire? Next time:
"The Old Monk's Prayer"

 No, it's not them. Okay... Let's go! Scoundrels! This is a problem, old guys. You should have received
a communication from the Land of Fire
about the temporary curfew. We thought we could be
of use somehow. We won't be giving in
to you youngsters! That was a surprise. Yeah... The Old Monk's Prayer

 Using the twenty platoons, we are currently laying out a search net
with a radius of 150 kilometers around the border and
the Temple of Fire. Even an ant couldn't crawl out. Excuse me. We have received a report
from Platoon Three. No sign of the Akatsuki
in border areas C and E. No sign, huh?! Reporting! Areas F and G are normal! The Akatsuki still have not been found! Then... Why haven't they been found? Have we heard from Team Asuma
who went to the Temple of Fire? No report from them yet. Chiriku... What's this...? You are from
the Hidden Leaf Village, right? Yes. We were contacted by the monk
who is in your care. I am the head monk
of the Temple of Fire. I had been out of
the temple for a while. When I heard about
what happened here... I rushed back as quickly
as I could, but... It was a terrible sight... We asked neighboring temples
for help recovering the remains. This is awful. Where's Chiriku? Actually...we have been unable
to find Lord Chiriku's remains. Umm... Captain Asuma. I don't really want to bring this up... But Chiriku has a 30 million ryo
bounty on his head on the black market. A bounty... If those guys from the Akatsuki
know about the bounty... Yeah... A collection office, huh? So that basically means the enemy
is carrying the body, right? Izumo, where is the collection office? Including the closest one,
there are five locations in total. Now the nearby teams can rush right
to the other four exchange point locations. All right, let's hurry. Please wait a moment,
Lord Asuma Sarutobi. Please allow me to say a prayer
for all of you who are about to fight. Please... Okay. Chiriku... Chiriku... Now I'm the only member of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve left, huh...? I wanted to talk the night away
with you one more time. There were things I wanted
to talk to you about. And things I wanted you to hear... Please be safe. Thank you very much. At the very least...
I'll get back Chiriku's remains. Please don't push things too far. You have a bounty on your head
for being a former member of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve...
just like Chiriku. Please be careful. You don't need to worry! The bounty on my head is
five million ryo more than Chiriku's. The only thing to worry about
with Asuma is that he smokes too much. I wonder what happened
with the training. And here I went to the trouble
of making and bringing more food pills. Nobody's here, huh? Sai. Did you come to check
on Naruto, too? No, I was just taking
a walk to make sure I didn't get out of shape
due to my injury. Oh, at a time like this... Actually, that's exactly right. Yes, it's good to be honest. Was Naruto's training...suspended? He probably just went off
somewhere to unwind. His body and mind won't hold up if he continues tough
special training like that. Ramen... Ichiraku ramen... Yeah-yeah, I know.
Walk just a little while longer. I know.
You should have one of these, too! What is this...? A mud ball? How rude. This is one of
my special homemade food pills! It's extra special! Special...? I suppose it's more like medicine
than a food pill. It's filled with nutritious ingredients
mixed with fast-acting digestive agents, all of which I hand-picked and rolled up
into a ball packed with energy! It works really well! And it might even add
some healthy color to that pale skin while it helps you recover! They say good medicine
tastes bitter, so the food pills might taste
a little strange. But when you consider
its merits after consumption, little details like that will be of no...huh? Sai...? Thank you for the pill. - Sai. Oh... I feel dizzy... This smell and taste are
going to make me sick before the medicine can work... T-Tonkotsu... Look, we're here... Hello. Welcome! Oh...hi. Old man, I'll take an extra-large
tonkotsu miso with pork slices... on the double. Here!
We have a new menu now! I want...an extra-large
tonkotsu miso with pork slices... and extra-firm noodles. Hey! Look at the menu! Sorry, Naruto. We've made some big changes
to the menu as of today. We now serve tsukemen! I see... Then, I'll have an extra-large
tonkotsu miso with pork slices... and extra red pickled ginger... I told you, we don't serve
ramen anymore! Huh? SPECIAL
ICHIRAKU TSUKEMEN So that means...
now you specialize in tsukemen? My daughter Ayame went out for
noodle-making training for a while. And when she came back she said,
"Dad, the age of tsukemen is here! We should explore
Ichiraku's new potential!" She gives me this smart-aleck advice,
you see... The tastes and preferences
of our customers change along with the times! Ichiraku will change so as
not to fall behind the times! What the heck are you doing? And here I was looking forward to...
tonkotsu miso with pork slices. Well, it's fine, isn't it? Tsukemen is pretty much
like ramen anyway, right? No, it's not. As with soba noodles, you dip tsukemen noodles
in sauce before eating them. It's the same thing in the end, right? The concept is different. That's right, that's right! Ramen is different from tsukemen!
I want to eat ramen! We've only prepared tsukemen,
so ramen is out of the question. But if you tweak the soup a little you could switch it
back to ramen, right? So you're satisfied with
phony ramen like that?! Is that all your love for tonkotsu miso
with pork slices amounts to?! No, it's not like that, but... Getting all worked up...
made me even hungrier. I don't...care anymore...
Just give me some tsukemen... Sure! Three orders of tsukemen! Right! Three orders of tsukemen! There you go! All right! Just a minute! Huh? The noodles are just
a tad undercooked. Boil them for one extra minute! Really? And check the temperature
of the hot water! -Right!
-You're going to make them again? Here you go!
Ichiraku tsukemen! Ooh! Finally! Huh? Where's the soup? It might be a little strong. The tsukemen that was popular
in Yugao Village was a little lighter. Let's make the soup again! Right! What?! The first taste is the key! We must lavish our customers
with the perfect flavor! That's the spirit, Ayame!
Show me the results of your training! Ramen-chan... Here you go!
Ichiraku's original tsukemen! This time it's perfect! Finally... O-Old man... Can I get some pork slices
and pickled bamboo shoots... and some fish cake...toppings...? Uh, okay. Sure. What're you doing, Naruto?! It's ramen if I eat it like this! That's tsukemen!
You can't eat it like that--! Ayame... You're forgetting the most
important thing about a restaurant. Instead of getting all caught up
in the little details, it's more important for
the customer to be satisfied, right? That's why I put my heart and soul
into making this tsukemen. It's a restaurant's responsibility to use
the best ingredients and preparation, and to advise the customer on
how to best enjoy them. But I want to eat ramen! Save it for after you've tried some
of the tsukemen. You'll never selfishly
ask for ramen ever again! -Thank you.
-Selfish? It's selfish for a restaurant -Tsukemen is lighter than ramen.
-to make choices for the customer! -This might be a little more to my taste.
-Only serving tsukemen means we have absolute confidence! Maybe I'm getting old. -My shoulders get really stiff
-If you've got so much confidence, -when I do something I'm not used to.
-then why does it take you so long?! -Maybe I'll hire some energetic youngster
-What's wrong with a little wait?! -to work here part time.
-You'll be able to eat something more delicious! At the end of the day,
anything tastes good when you're hungry. Thanks for the tsukemen-ramen! I'm stuffed! Considering he complained about it, I can't believe he drank every last drop
of that strong tsukemen soup. Although there's a problem
with how he ate the tsukemen... I guess I can't complain
since he had three bowls. All right, let's get right back to training! No, before that... Huh? Naruto... I'll show you something cool. Something cool? There are some things
I want to explain to you while we take a little rest after eating. What?
More complicated explanations? It'll be okay...
I'm a slick talker, so you'll get it. Here's your bill. Yamato, you take care of this. What?! Isn't it usually the senior
who takes care of it? There are no seniors or juniors
in regards to the men I respect. Well, you're pretty much
the only junior... I respect. But I suppose I really should... -Thank you very much!
-Oh, keep the change. You really are a slick talker. I'm really sick of how lousy
you are at conversation. A nice trip is totally ruined if you get stuck traveling with
a totally boring person. We're not traveling for fun. And I've had it with looking
for Jinchuriki when we don't even know
where the heck they might be. Put yourself in my position. I'm forced to go along
with all this extra work. I'd like a little sympathy here. Just shut up and keep walking...
We're late. Huh?
We're late because we're going to that Collection Office
or whatever it is, right? For crying out loud... you're making this boring trip
even longer. It's really annoying...I tell you... Annoying, you say?
This is also an important mission. Yeah, whatever.
You've been left in charge of scraping together money
for the organization, right? A pittance like that would
only be enough to pay for an after-party
for Tailed-Beast hunting. Oh! Hey, I'm sorry! Hey, that body is heavy, isn't it?
I could carry it for you. What're you going to do...
with my valuable bounty? I was just being nice. You're going to discard it, right? What're you talking about? I can see right through you. You want to get rid of this body, right? Oh, you got me. We should just forget about that
and get right to the Jinchuriki. I finally got to you. You're such a prick. Hey, hey, hey! Are you done already? I don't have the time to
be joining you in your diversions. And besides...at some point after
this mission is finished, I'll send you to the next world
so that you won't get bored in this one. Not that again. Oh, man... I hope our next opponent
has enough fight in them so I can let off some steam. Kakashi Sensei,
what're you going to show me? This is the cool thing...
I wanted to show you. This is... R-Rasengan...? You can also use...
the Rasengan, Kakashi Sensei?! I can't believe the Rasengan was
an unfinished Jutsu. Adding a Change in Chakra Nature
to the Rasengan is something even the Fourth Hokage
couldn't do. In other words,
I can't teach you what comes next. You have to discover it for yourself. No way... Hey, do you know
why I'm telling you this, Naruto? - Huh?
- It's because I believe... you're the only Shinobi who
can go beyond the Fourth Hokage. Next time:
"The Next Step"


 That's not fair! You're easily using the Rasengan
even though it's my secret technique! And I had such a rough time enduring
the Pervy Sage's harsh training. Listen... - We're just getting to the main issue...
- And you can do it just like that. And with one hand at that... And all I can do is spin it around
into shape with a clone... Man, this is too much trouble... Let me try. Well, let's wait for him to
calm down a little more. I didn't show you the Rasengan because
I wanted to brag about it or anything. Yeah, right. I told you the Rasengan is a Jutsu with only the Change in Chakra Form
taken to the extreme, right? Change in Chakra Form...? And...a Jutsu with
the Change in Chakra Nature added to the Change in Chakra Form... For example... Chidori. Oh, more bragging, huh? Not only does this Jutsu use
the Change in Chakra Nature to shift the Chakra Nature
into lightning... but it also uses Change in Chakra Form
to transform it into an electrical discharge
and control its range and power. Listen up. When you take Chakra
and add in Change in Chakra Form and Change in Chakra Nature... the attack power of a Shinobi
rises dramatically. Well, there are hardly any Shinobi
who can use both Change in Chakra Form
and Nature, though. I knew it. You're bragging. You obtained the wind Change
in Chakra Nature in your training earlier. And you already possess
the ultimate Change in Chakra Form. Rasengan... That's right. Then that means... I already have both? Well...that's pretty much the case. All right! Then it looks like I'll be able
to get a new Jutsu just like that! Yes, yes, yes, yes! This is going to be a cinch! If it were that easy, it wouldn't have been necessary
for me to develop the Chidori. I wasn't able to combine
the Rasengan Change in Chakra Form with my lightning Change in Chakra Nature. Phenomenal technique is
necessary to combine the Change in Chakra Nature
with the Change in Chakra Form. Well, it might be better to say one needs
a phenomenal "ability" or "sense." I wasn't the only one who
was not able to get this far. It was the same even for
the teacher who invented this Jutsu. Teacher? That's right... Even the Fourth Hokage
couldn't do it. The Fourth Hokage took
the Change in Chakra Form to the highest possible level. And that's the Rasengan. Just a Change in Chakra Form
has an A-rank difficulty level. Even I can somehow copy it
if it's just to this degree. The problem is what comes after that. The Fourth Hokage originally
developed the Rasengan intending to add his own
Change in Chakra Nature to it. Then that means the Rasengan
was a Ninjutsu still being developed? That's pretty much the case. Any Jutsu beyond that would be an S-rank difficulty level or
maybe even higher. Furthermore,
it might be impossible to begin with... I won't be able to teach you
what comes next. You'll have to discover it for yourself. Do you know... Do you know why
I'm telling you this, Naruto? It's because
I believe you're the only Shinobi... who can surpass the Fourth Hokage. Well... That's enough talk for now. I guess we'll start up training again
after a bit more rest. Just what I'd expect from you, Kakashi. Sure enough, you are a slick talker. No... I really do believe in him. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! The Next Step


 Lady Tsunade! We have received a message
from Team Asuma! It seems...the two Akatsuki
are heading for a Collection Office. Of the locations...
the nearest Collection Office is... We're close! At any moment...
we're going to fight the Akatsuki. It'll be okay, Ino. There's nothing to be afraid of as long as
we do as Asuma Sensei taught us. Right. Just kidding. Shikamaru said that
to me on a previous mission. Choji... Shikamaru's doing his best, too.
We've got to keep it together. Asuma Sensei... What kind of relationship did
you have with that Chiriku guy? What's the deal all of a sudden? A heavy smoker like you
hasn't smoked in two whole days. You always  stop smoking...
when something has happened. You're so observant... I'm far too soft if you can see
right through to my heart like that. Well, I can always tell what move you're going to make
when we play Shogi. You haven't looked like this since
the Third Hokage passed away. You know that Chiriku and I
were fellow members of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, right? I guess you could say...
we were like you and Choji. You won't stop smoking for long. I won't stop smoking for long...huh? Indeed, that's how it's gone until now. Shikamaru, I appreciate you
worrying about me. But I didn't stop smoking
because of Chiriku. More importantly, the guys from Akatsuki
are good enough to kill Chiriku. They probably have
a great deal of skill. Stay sharp! STABILIZE Okay, form the Rasengan
in teams of two. And at the same time, incorporate the wind Change in
Chakra Nature into the Rasengan. Well, it's easy to say... but I can't concretely tell you
to do this or that. Naruto, you just have to think about it
and grasp this on your own. Okay...shall we begin? Right! Create a "wind Change in Chakra Nature" ...with my Wind Chakra! That being said... how do we do that while creating
a Rasengan Change in Chakra Form?! That's what I  want to know! Damn it! That's reckless...
He just finished cutting the waterfall. At just a time like this... Umm...I could just say nothing. But I'll be honest with you...
These food pills are really awful. What?!
They're not awful! I got creative with this...
so they'd be easy to consume... What...?! Then I'll eat one, okay? I knew it... Sure enough, he's quick to tire when
using his Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu. Damn it... Let's go! Right! Incorporate wind Chakra into this. Damn it! This is impossible. And here I need a ton of concentration
just for the Rasengan. And then having to add
the Change in Chakra Nature to that... It's like saying look to the left
and right at the same time. Damn it! This isn't the time to be throwing
in the towel already! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! H-Hey, where are you going?! The bathroom?!
I guess it can't be helped. We'll take a leak together. This is the Collection Office. Why put a secret door in a bathroom? This way. Put it here. Okay. Hurry up and get it done! No doubt about it.
It is Chiriku. You got yourself a big one
this time, Kakuzu. Yeah... Hey, this place stinks. Let's get going, Kakuzu. Wait. I'm going to count the money. I'm never coming to a place
like this again. I can't tell if the stench is
from the piss or the corpses. I'll be outside. We're almost...
at the Collection Office... It's almost time... Let's get ready. It's all here. I'll be counting on you...
for the next one, sir. Sorry, but I won't be back for a while. We're going to the Hidden Leaf
to look for a Jinchuriki. Let me give you some advice.
You should ditch that partner of yours. He doesn't seem interested in money. I know that. Indeed, he has
no interest in money. But nobody else is capable
of being my partner. There's a reason for that. A reason, huh? Everyone else who teamed up
with me is dead. When I have trouble with a partner,
I end up wanting to kill them. But I can't kill him. That's the reason. Concentrate... Like grinding
the two Chakra together... Hey! Tenzo! I know. Naruto... If Naruto keeps doing this, he'll... And I can't keep stopping that
over and over again... - I can't...
- No... This is the only way. Whether or not his Jutsu
is completed rides on you. I understand... The Akatsuki...are up ahead. Let's go! Ohh, it stinks! Being in a crap hole like that
for five minutes would soak my clothes in the stench. Took you long enough, Kakuzu. There's no sign of the Akatsuki
having come to this Collection Office. Furthermore, it doesn't even look like anyone's been
through here for several days. Have we heard from the platoons
that went to the other locations? No, nothing yet. That means nobody's made contact yet
with the Akatsuki, right? And Asuma Sensei
and Shikamaru also, right? It'll be okay.
You don't need to worry. We know better than anyone else
how strong Asuma Sensei is, right? Next time:
"Climbing Silver"


 They haven't been here yet. Not yet, huh? We'll monitor the area here
until there's movement! I-I don't know...
No way would I tell you even if I did. That's what he says.
Should we kill him? We should leave the torture to Ibiki. No signs of the Akatsuki, after all. Same here. It doesn't look like anyone's been
through here for several days... I think it's certain
they haven't been here yet. What's the plan, Aoba? There are still no requests for backup from the units that went to
the other four Collection Offices. Which means there's still been
no contact with the Akatsuki, huh? Well, I don't know about that. They might already be in
the middle of a fight right now. Don't worry. It'd be reassuring if Asuma's unit were to make contact with the Akatsuki. You guys know of his strength
better than anyone, right? That's right. Yeah, and Shikamaru's with him, too. All right! Let's head out and
work out another strategy. Let's go! Let's sort out all the information
we have right now. The Akatsuki have headed for
one of the five Collection Offices. There have been no requests
for backup from the other four. And they haven't been to
this Collection Office, yet. That means... Right. There's a chance they might still be heading for
this Collection Office. That's about the size of it.
We'll lie in wait and grab them. These are all the possible patterns of
action for the enemy at this stage. All of you take up positions and
wait as devised earlier! Yes, sir! Where'd the Akatsuki go? Climbing Silver Took you long enough, Kakuzu! Too slow. We got one to start. That hurts...
What's with you jerks? What's the meaning of this?
We pierced his vital spots. Don't push it in deeper like that! Hey, that hurts! Is this guy...immortal? Isn't it obvious?
So...who're you guys? That mark. If I remember correctly, it's from
the Guardian Shinobi or something... Are you kidding me? Do I have to go back inside that
smelly Collection Office again? Chiriku... We're Hidden Leaf Shinobi. We've been ordered to either
capture or eliminate you Akatsuki. Akatsuki operate in teams of two. Our intention was to take down
one of you first and then capture the other. But you're pretty tough,
as was expected. So this is the Akatsuki, huh?
What insane ability. My Shadow Sewing probably won't... You jerks went after us
in the wrong order. Where's the other one? The Jutsu's broken! Kotetsu, Izumo, get back! Sure enough, the guy in the middle... This is a first, you being interested
in money, Hidan. Kakuzu... You stay out of this. I'm going to use these guys for my ritual. I'll give you the money. Kakuzu...and Hidan, huh? Very well... But don't get careless.
You'll die. I told you.
Don't give me that. If they could  kill me,
I'd want them to. Well... I guess it's impossible, huh?! What's he going to do
with that diagram? I'll charge him. Shikamaru, exploit an opening and restrain the immortal guy
with your Shadow Sewing. It doesn't have to be for long. I'll cut his head off immediately
and stop his movements. That's too risky.
This isn't like you. I should go with you. Don't you get it?! That's the best thing we can do right now! I've never seen Asuma
look like this before. These guys are way
stronger than me. Izumo, Kotetsu,
you guys back up Shikamaru while keeping an eye on
the other Akatsuki guy. If we know what they're capable of,
then all the more reason we should pull out for now
and plan a strategy. They won't let us get away
that easily. If we try to escape
without putting up a fight, we'll be completely wiped out... If that happens,
the Hidden Leaf will be in even greater danger. It's like sending in an advance unit
to break through enemy lines. Sometimes you have to be able
to make a move like that. I thought you didn't like moves like that.
Just like me... Sacrifice is required in order
to protect the king when your opponent
is extremely skilled. Don't tell me he's going
to sacrifice himself. One of them has great physical strength
with unknown abilities. One of them is immortal. Indeed, we don't
stand much of a chance. Even so, I can't believe Asuma would
use himself as a sacrificial piece. Shogi?
What a pain... I know you're lazy. And I also know
that you're good at planning strategies
for avoiding trouble. In Shogi, you can create
a variety of situations by utilizing the individual characteristics
of the various pieces. It's the perfect game
for a person like you who's good at
coming up with strategies. You should be able to
figure out most of the rules
if you read this book. The rest you'll pick up as you play. It's a pain, but I should have it
down in ten minutes. I-I lost... You don't have to go easy on me...
Seriously. But I can't believe you'd go
with the Climbing Silver. It was in this book. It said to use an advance unit
to break through enemy lines. Are you that upset you lost? No. Using advance units
as sacrificial pieces to break through enemy lines, huh? It seems like the rational kind of idea
you would come up with... But I don't really like it. It's just a game. I guess.
But the Climbing Silver piece, while inflicting a lot of damage
and undermining the enemy line, ends up becoming a sacrificial piece. Certainly taking each other's pieces
is a natural part of the game. But to consider throwing away
your pieces to be by-the-book... I guess
I'm not quite satisfied with that. I'm not as rational
as you say I am. Shall we play again? This time I'll take it nice and slow, and I won't use the Climbing Silver. Breaking through enemy lines... Which means these enemies
are so powerful, he thinks using sacrificial pieces
is inevitable, huh? Indeed, we Chunin
would not be pieces that could put pressure
on these guys. Furthermore, Asuma would be
at an overwhelming disadvantage if he had to fight while protecting us. We could very well be completely
wiped out as Asuma said. What's the best move? They are major pieces,
no doubt about it. Bait is necessary to
capture a major piece. We need bait that's big enough
to make them think it's an unavoidable price to pay
for the capture of a major piece. We're not good enough...
to be bait. If we have to fight with the pieces
we have available to us now... The Climbing Silver doesn't suit you. I won't be a mere sacrificial piece.
I've got you with me, after all. How pathetic... I can't be the bait and I can't put
pressure on the enemy. But I'll divert the major pieces
like crazy. Are you done with
your little strategy session? Getting cut up like that
hurts like heck, you jerks. Divine justice will be handed down
to you jerks who know nothing of the pain of others. You've got a nice weapon there! Asuma! Damn it! Reach! I'm finished if I get hit by that. I'll break you over and over again. Shikamaru... That's fine. He has to fight while watching out
for your Shadow Sewing. I have the advantage. Damn it! Indeed, my Shadow Sewing attack
is creating an advantageous battle for Asuma. Essentially, we're not mistaken... But there's no point to
having an advantage in this fight. He's immortal, and we have a limit to
our Chakra and our lives. The real battle won't begin
until I grab him. I don't have the time to think now. I don't think so! Oh no! That stance! How's Chiriku's Jutsu? Naturally, Chiriku's is much
more impressive than mine, though. Damn it! Hidan! Don't underestimate them. Keep quiet! Just shut up and watch, Kakuzu. Nice! As one would expect,
the two of them are in synch. It appears he really is going
to stay out of this. Even so, we can't trust him to do that. You almost got him just now, Shikamaru. More importantly... Could you back me up? You guys are too desperate. Atheists always try to escape death
with the most efficient approach. It's totally obvious! You play around too much
when you fight. Now! This time you've got nowhere to run. Then I won't dodge! Immortal jerk! I guess I'll take care of the small fries first. Oh no! I'm your opponent! Captain Asuma! If combo and pinpoint attacks won't hit... Burning Ash! He stopped his movements? What's happening? He's the one who was nailed by the Jutsu? Why's the captain...?! Don't tell me...this is...! Hey, did you figure something out, Shikamaru? I don't know what kind of approach
he used. But his and Asuma's body
might be connected with some kind of mechanism. Say what?! Connected? What does that mean?! Next time:
"The Judgment"


 It hurts, doesn't it? Well? The judgment has been
handed down. Wh-What do you mean? How about it? Has this helped you understand
the pain that other people feel, even a little bit? Even my arm... Has his Jutsu done something? No, that can't be... You have already fallen
under my curse. The ceremony will now begin. Well, then... Why not taste the ultimate pain
with me?! The Judgment


 You have already fallen
under my curse. The ceremony will now begin. Well, then! Why not taste
the ultimate pain with me?! Why is Captain Asuma burned? Wasn't his opponent the one hit
by the Fire Style Jutsu?! He definitely was hit. But for some reason, Captain Asuma was also
burned by the Jutsu! This...could it be that... This will net us 35 million in gold. All the preparations are
now complete! It's going to hurt like crazy,
so get ready! Take that! It hurts, doesn't it?! But this is nothing.
I haven't got you in a vital spot yet! Believe me,
THAT pain is out of this world! The pain another feels while
dying penetrates into my own body! I pass through the pain, transcend it,
and turn it into pleasure! Captain Asuma... is holding his left leg. Something strange is going on. It's the same injured leg as the opponent who stabbed himself
with his own lance! Wh-Why... You have already fallen
under my curse. So that's how it is! But of course... His body and mine are connected
with some curse. In other words, the damage dealt
to our bodies is also linked. Furthermore, he is immortal. Where would you like to hurt next? Hmm? Here? Or here? How about both legs
at the same time?! Or... shall we end now?! How about it?! Shikamaru! You must not use
a physical attack like Shadow Sewing! Stop his movements with
Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Hurry! I'm already on it! Better make it in time! Please make it in time! Die--! Do you think I'd let that happen?! You did it, Shikamaru! This won't stop me for long! Izumo, how many minutes have passed since you requested backup? About ten minutes. It'll be at least another 20 minutes
before reinforcements arrive. That long?! Damn...! What should we do?! If we kill him,
Captain Asuma will also die! Usually, one must kill one's opponent
in order to break a long-lasting type Jutsu. But if that is not possible... Every Jutsu inevitably has rules
associated with it, as well as risks and pitfalls. First, I need to calm down
and analyze the opponent. I was saved,
thanks to Shikamaru. I must take this chance and
think of a way to break this Jutsu. With him as an opponent, the Shadow Strangle Jutsu
 won't hold out that long. There's little time to consider
the next move. If this wears on any longer, I'll lend a hand. We can't let all the money get away. I told you to butt out, Kakuzu! I can handle this...! Truth be told, the situation as it is... we're lucky the other guy has
stayed out of the fight for now. Be that as it may,
there's still the question of what to do. Well, it's all a matter of time now... Why that... That's it... Think back... Surely, I've come this far assuming I'd be fighting against an adversary
beyond the scope of my imagination. OROCHIMARU


The Akatsuki Organization
is made up of ten members. But Orochimaru withdrew. SASORI


Sasori of the Red Sand is dead. ITACHI


Of the remaining ones,
we know the identities of three. KISAME


Kisame Hoshigaki, who is reputed to have sparred
with Guy Sensei with ease... He might be a Water Style User. ITACHI


Sasuke's older brother,
Itachi Uchiha with his Sharingan... It was his handiwork that put Kakashi
in the hospital for over a week. Deidara, said to have sparred
with Naruto. He uses animated explosive clay. DEIDARA


He blew himself up in the end. It's doubtful whether that story
 is actually true. That leaves five members
of the Akatsuki Organization... Whichever of the faces
in this file you pick, you'll find him to be one tough opponent. Their Ninjutsu will be of a level
that should not be underestimated. Though the true nature of
these five is unknown, there is no doubt they have special abilities
 that are beyond our imagination. RECORD OF PAST BATTLES


Good grief. We're up against the worst possible
 bunch of fellows. When it comes to this, it's meaningless to formulate
a strategy in advance. In fact, any preconceptions
 might make matters worse. So, what should we do? It goes without saying that
we should train to get stronger, but what happens when you encounter  an adversary against whom
you cannot win? The nature and extent of
the enemy's powers-- his Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, and Genjutsu. You must discern what type
of Ninja he is. Then you need to determine whether
 or not it's a combined attack by guys who function as a two-man cell. And if there's a possibility of that, then what kind of chemistry does
he have with his team members? We need to gather as
much information as possible and make a split second decision. When you're up against an organization
like the Akatsuki, there isn't even time to
gather such information, is there? Akatsuki, you say? Asuma... Have you already taken action
against the Akatsuki Organization? No, I came to the conclusion that
it was pointless. That's what you think. If you got hold of even one piece
of information about the enemy, it could lead to a successful strategy. If we could get our hands
on such information. That's difficult since we're up
against the Akatsuki for the first time. A guy like me would be blown away
in an instant. Well, you're probably right about that. RECORD OF PAST BATTLES
CLASSIFIED DATA VOL. 1


It's mortifying,
but those are guys who don't slack off. That is if you were to come up against
the Akatsuki on a one-to-one basis. You are one of the best at judging
and analyzing a situation, even among the Hidden Leaf. If you can't find the time to strategize
in a one-on-one combat, then depend upon your comrades. Team responsibility is important, but one who does not rely
upon his comrades... KISAME


is not fulfilling that responsibility. There are times when even
if you can't do it alone, things will somehow work out if you and your comrades
pool each others strengths. It's not enough for things to
just somehow work out. Then, do something. Before your comrades get done in. Asuma has left me with
a wealth of information. Think! You've got to think! Remarks, personality, speech patterns...
the clothes they wear... Grasp their movements
right up to now. The significance of
each and every action. And then the connection between actions. Develop a hypothesis about their abilities that can be drawn from
all these factors. It's all about observation and analysis. God's judgment will be handed down! God...judgment... You have already fallen under my curse. The ceremony will now begin. A curse...the ceremony... With this, all preparations are complete! Preparations...! Looks like Shikamaru
came up with an idea. Did you figure something out, Shikamaru? Yeah! It's amazing that you're capable
of such an analysis while still maintaining your Jutsu. Shikamaru is endowed with
lightning powers of analysis that enable him to look ten steps ahead
and predict 200 more. What's more,
he has the intuition to choose  the best possible strategy
based on that analysis. I'm heading out, Captain Asuma... That Shadow Jutsu... Does it force the person it's used on
to mirror the motions of its caster? Why you... Trying to sniff out the true nature
 of my Jutsu. What are you going to do?! I'll draw that creep outside the strange
pattern drawn on the ground! If I do that,
his curse Jutsu will be broken. What on earth does that mean?! His weapon... That huge scythe with three blades. Judging by its shape, I'd say it's not
designed to land a single fatal blow, but rather increase
his attack range. All his weapons are designed to
cause damage from a distance. In other words, his tactic is to
only injure his opponent and then buy time to deploy
a lethal Jutsu. And by that you mean the curse? But what's the connection between
the enemy's wound and the curse? It's blood... In order to form a link between himself
and his targeted opponent, he needs to find a way to incorporate
that opponent's blood into his own body. So when he was licking the blood... Then if he wounds his opponent and
even a little blood adheres to that sickle... he can curse his opponent. But of course... After licking the blood,
his body changed color. That is a condition for invoking the curse.
But that's not all. In order to completely invoke the curse,
one more condition must be met. One more? This brat knows his stuff. A little while ago, that creep let Asuma's Fire Style Jutsu
roll right off him. He was unfazed, but he hurried back to that strange pattern
drawn on the ground, remember? And once he was standing
inside that pattern, he said the ceremony would begin. And by howling that the preparations
were now complete... We can surmise the set-up
for his art of cursing is only complete once he steps
inside that pattern. You little brat! You talk too much. He was able to figure
all that out? You little brat! Why you! I'll get you later!
I'll tear you limb from limb! I'll pulverize you! I'll turn you inside out! There isn't going to be a "later"! We got him out! All right! The curse is broken! All right! Wha--?! Nuts... I can't move... I'm at my limit! I don't think
I can hold him any longer. You did well, Shikamaru. Kakuzu! Lend me a hand! Hey! Snap to it! I told you to keep your wits
about you. All right! So this leaves
only one opponent remaining? But his power and speed are probably
greater than that of the immortal guy. And he may still have abilities
we don't know about...! Shikamaru! Shikamaru is exhausted. And the captain is wounded. What do you want to do, Izumo? We have the advantage of
outnumbering our opponents and even immobilized one of them. But perhaps we should start
looking for a chance to retreat. Next time:
"Unfulfilled Scream"


 W-We...did it! We did it! We did it... To tell the truth,
that was a very dangerous situation. Without Shikamaru's accurate analysis... we probably would have been
completely done for. Good grief... He's really something... It's no wonder Asuma
puts so much confidence in him. Shikamaru! Are you all right? Yeah. With this, there remains... Only one more left, huh? If you wanted help,
you should have said so sooner. You were too slow, Kakuzu! You did that on purpose, didn't you?! You were the one who told me
to butt out at the beginning. So are you really in
any position to complain? Well, I did order you to hold back. But that wasn't because I was trying to make a fool of you
or disrespect you. Well, never mind about that.
Anyway, bring my body over here. Kakuzu...
Will you bring my body...? Come on Kakuzu, buddy. Wha--?! Hey! Wait a minute! See here, Kakuzu!
What about my body? I thought I told you to bring
my body over here! This is lighter. That's not the issue, now is it? Are you ignoring me? Hey! Unfulfilled Scream


 Ouch...it hurts...hey! Kakuzu, you're pulling my hair!
Stop that! If you are hurting at all,
it should be in your neck. You moron! The pain in my neck isn't a tickle. It's excruciating!
This is more than just a simple injury. That guy... In that state, he's still alive! It hurts like crazy! See here! The nerve of you,
cutting off my head! This is incredibly painful,
you numbskull! Wh-What's that? What's going on? I don't know what to think of this... At this rate... Even if he's still alive,
he's useless in that condition. It appears he can't move unless
he's connected to a body. His arts are useless in that state. He may be immortal, but right now,
he can't do anything. That's for sure. So then, there's only one opponent left. Yes... That may be, but that one... No doubt he possesses powers and speed
that exceed the immortal guy. What's more, he'll have the kind
of cool nerve you can't fight against on the strength
of pure momentum alone. And furthermore... He'll be the hard-nosed kind that
doesn't budge in the slightest, even if his comrades get done in...
a real heart of stone. We have yet to see his true power. Or rather, his confidence may be due
to the fact that he has not shown it yet. This kind of enemy is always gauging
 the difference in strength between himself and his opponents
and calculating his advantages. In that case, he may think
it's in his best interests to convince us of being in
an advantageous position. Shikamaru! Shikamaru has really pushed himself
 to his limit. Captain Asuma is injured too.  We are at an advantage in that  we have immobilized one of
the Akatsuki Organization's members, but... On the other hand, you could also say this gives us
 the opportunity to escape. In that case,
the thing we need to worry about is... Shikamaru's condition. You mustn't open yourself up to attack! He is such a pushover. Captain Asuma! Since you've now asked me
to lend a hand, I'm going to join in too. I get it... Ow! Ouch! Hey, hold still, will you? Those guys... What are they up to? Okay, that should do it. His head... It's been reconnected. It's good to be whole again. If you move around too much,
it'll come off again. Kakuzu, you're always such a nag. What on earth...are we fighting? An immortal man...
and a man who possesses a Jutsu that can sew back together
a dismembered body... Damn! It's just one thing after another.
How powerful are they?! Your fights and your complaining
seem to go on forever. Just like your ceremonies. You take care of the one with
the price on his head. I'll pay them back in spades. Because it wouldn't do to violate
the commandment. That again? Well, never mind.
As for the three remaining... I'll take care of them. Izumo! Got it! Right! Water Style: Syrup Trap! Right! Did that do the trick? I suppose you meant to grab
your opponent's attention with that eye-catching aerial attack
to create an opening. And then follow-up with
a land attack by coordinating your movements
with this strange liquid, but... I think it's half-baked. There's too much wasted effort. Now! What--?! Right! Before you know it... That's great! Izumo! You're mine! Kotetsu! Damn...! Huh?! They're giving me a good run
for my money. Well now, Kakuzu seems to
be finishing up pretty soon... Isn't it about time I stepped in? Otherwise, I'll start hearing about
how my ceremonies "go on forever." So long. Asuma! Behind you! So long! Asuma! Behind you! It's the same moves
over and over again. Not the same, you moron! Damn! Damn! In the end... In the end, even you were willing
to sacrifice yourself  to protect your comrades! I don't get it! What's wrong with this strategy?! If I succeeded in my Shadow Sewing, then we would have been
able to stop the enemy and reduce their fighting power
by half. But when I tried to make
Shadow Sewing work on a distant opponent, I just fell into a trap. So Shadow Sewing is not necessarily
effective against a distant opponent. Yet, if Shadow Sewing is used
in close combat, its binding force becomes more powerful,
and its success rate increases. Isn't that what the strategy is for? Are you suggesting a two-top formation in which you use
Shadow Sewing aggressively at the front lines backed by
my charging power? That's it. With that formation, I'd be able to tie up the enemy
at the front lines. Shikamaru, I think highly
of your strategy. Well, in that case, why not try it? That's the very reason
why it's no good! This unit is excellent. In terms of fighting power, it's simply a four-man cell
including three Chunin... but my unit has a strategist
that's lacking in other units. Shikamaru, that's you! A good strategist assesses conditions
from back in the rear guard and directs the movements of
the unit off the basis of that judgment. You have superb powers of judgment,
and it's an advantage to the unit. Bringing you around to the front lines
could actually increase the risks we face in carrying out our mission. Even I... Even I understand the pain
of losing a comrade. Isn't that a good reason
why it's the best possible strategy? I understand there's some risk involved. If it enables me to protect
many of my comrades... If by " protecting your comrades"
you're referring to us, then you don't understand at all. The things that we're protecting... The reasons we're fighting... Unless you understand
the true meaning of that, there's no way I can put you out
in the front lines. It's my fault... If I... If I had thought up
a better strategy... none of this would ever have... Don't you get it? That' s the best thing
we can do right now! I've never seen Asuma like this before. It's like sending in an advance unit
to break through enemy lines. Sometimes you have to be able
to make a move like that. A straightforward attack like
the Climbing Silver doesn't suit you. I won't be a mere sacrificial piece.
I've got you with me, after all. Damn! Damn! It's my fault... It's my fault... If I hadn't been such a numbskull. Asuma wouldn't be in such a fix! How is it? Does it hurt? Huh? Well, how about it?! Finally... I finally get to taste that pain. The pain of killing you... Captain! Damn! It's over. Stop... Asuma... I-It feels so good... Asuma! Don't bother trying to patch me up. This is as far as I go. That much...I understand. The things the Third Hokage
did to protect the village. I feel like I only now have come
to understand them. I'm always so slow. And so,
Ino, Choji, Shikamaru... I have some last words
I'd like to say to you... Next time: "Last Words"


 HOKAGE Asuma... Asuma! Last Words


 Asuma... I'm finished. I'll just be another minute. Damn it... Damn it... You son of a gun! Damn... I'm so powerless... Feathers...?! What the hell?! Do you think you can beat us
with crows?! I wasn't born yesterday! Blindfold! A back sword! Shikamaru! We're here to help you. Ino... Take Shikamaru somewhere safe! Yes! Don't let your guard down, Choji! Okay! Reinforcements... Are you okay?! Forget me.
First Captain Asuma... Asuma Sensei! He still has a heartbeat! Choji! Take Asuma Sensei to
the Hidden Leaf Hospital right now! Ino, you go along with him and use your Medical Ninjutsu
to heal him as much as possible! Hurry! I got it! Right! I'm not giving up my bounty. Damn...! We'll hold them back. Meanwhile, you get Asuma out of here! You can struggle all you like,
but you'll be sacrificed to God... That's why... Huh?! Can't you wait a little longer?! Seriously, it is just getting better. It's time to seal the Two-Tails... Come right away!
This is the top priority. See, I told you...
It's almost there! Knock it off, Hidan! Are they communicating with someone?! Tsk... We'll be right back...
Be prepared! They're high maintenance... Let's go, Hidan. Damn that pigheaded leader...
I'll curse him next time! What's going on?!
Are they pulling back...?! Sensei! Asuma Sensei! Ino, Choji! Hurry up and
get Asuma out of here! Now! I'm telling you! Stay still until we get back! He's about to die! Later, losers! Choji! Ino! Hurry up! I'll use my Medical Ninjutsu! Right! No...more... I'm done... Even I know that... You all must realize it, too. Shut up! Don't speak! Ino! Okay! Ino... Here... And here, too?! They got four vital spots. There's nothing more I can do... Now I think I finally realize... why the Third did...what he did... I...always took too long... I have some last words... I'd like to say...
to Ino, Choji and Shikamaru... - Sensei, you shouldn't talk anymore!
- Choji! Ino, you, too. These are Asuma Sensei's last words... Listen carefully. Ino... Yes... You're strong-willed, but dependable... Both Choji and Shikamaru... They're clumsy...
so please take care of them... Yes... And don't let Sakura beat you... Not in Ninjutsu or romance. Yes! Choji... You're a kind man who cares
for his comrades... That's why... you'll become a Shinobi
who's stronger than anyone else. Have more confidence...in yourself. Okay... And...you may need to diet a little. That might be impossible,
but I'll give it my best shot! And...Shikamaru... You're so sharp...
and have great instincts as a Shinobi... You could definitely become Hokage. Well...you're lazy...
so you'd probably hate it... I never once...beat you...at Shogi... Oh yea, the story about the King... If you were to liken the Leaf Shinobi
to a Shogi piece, Shikamaru... In the end, you would be a Knight. Then what would you be, Sensei?! I'm nothing. I'm just... A sacrificial piece...huh?! Then...do you know who the King is?! Huh? The Hokage, right?! That's what I thought until just recently... But it's not like that. Then who is it? You'll understand
when the time comes. I'll tell you who the King is...
Lend me your ear. Asuma...you...!
That's why... I'm counting on you, Shikamaru... It doesn't matter now, does it? Even though I quit smoking... They're in my pouch... I want one last smoke... Oh! Sorry about that. I'm Asuma Sarutobi,
and I'll be leading Team Ten from today. It's not going to be easy,
so I hope you're all ready! Oh, please don't cry!
All I said was that I'm going to be strict! The smoke is getting in our eyes! BARBE-Q


More rice!
Also bring four more servings of kalbi! Thanks for waiting! Choji, have you ever heard
of the word restraint?! The bill went up to at least 3,000 ryo. I'm saying this not because I'm stingy. I'm just worried about you. If you keep eating like this,
eventually you're gonna be fa--! That word is taboo! "Fa-" what?!
Is there something wrong, Shikamaru?! O-Oh... H-He said
you can order the deluxe course meal. What--?! Wow! Really?! Asuma Sensei, thank you for treating! Waiter, bring two deluxe course meals
with extra rice, please! I'm stuffed! I'm satisfied! Here... Oh... Who're they for?! Oh...nobody in particular... S-See you later... Say "Hi" to Kurenai Sensei for me! What?! How did...you know that...?! Shogi?! What a pain... You can create a variety of situations by utilizing the individual characteristics
of the various pieces. It's the perfect game for
a person like you GUIDE TO SHOGI


who's good at coming up with strategies. You should be able to figure out
most of the rules if you read this book. The rest you'll pick up as you play. It'll be troublesome, but...
I'll have it down in ten minutes. I-I lost... You don't have to go easy on me...
Seriously. You're the only one who passed
the Chunin Exam this time. As your Jonin team leader,
I'm very proud of you. Ino and Choji,
you two keep working hard! Choji, Ino, you guys did well... And now along with Shikamaru
who passed last time, all members of Team Ten
are legitimate Chunin. And now...I will no longer be
in charge of you guys. From here on, each of you will become a captain
and lead new teams. These earrings are
my congratulatory gifts to each of you. Don't ever forget that
you were members of Team Ten! Sensei! He died as a true Shinobi. After all... I hate cigarettes... The smoke...gets in my eyes... I see. Ah...how about Kurenai...?! You guys inform everyone
about the funeral. I'll tell Kurenai... No... I'll do it.
I'll let her know. Captain Asuma
left me a message for her... Next time: "Sad News"


 STABILIZE If I focus on the Rasengan, the Change in Chakra Nature
becomes unstable. However, if I focus on
the Change in Chakra Nature, the Rasengan doesn't turn out well. I'm so pathetic... It's because I believe... you're the only Shinobi who can go
beyond the Fourth Hokage. That's what I believe. Here Kakashi Sensei has
such high hopes for me... And I'm not fulfilling his hopes at all... What should we do?
Should we stop for now? If that's what he wants to do... I... I... Damn it! I don't have time to just sit around! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Be careful, guys! There's another one turning
into the Nine-Tails! Captain Yamato, help! Tenzou, it's the Nine-Tails again! Damn it! You okay? It's been one full day since
you started training to add the wind Change in Chakra Nature
to the Rasengan... And you're using around
200 Shadow Clones. It would take one person
4,800 hours to complete that training... I guess it's still not nearly enough. But in this training,
the Chakra control is too hard, and 200 Shadow Clones is my limit... I get the feeling...
I'll never be able to do this. It takes a ton of concentration to form the Rasengan in the first place. It's too much to try to create
a Change in Chakra Nature on top of that. You're unusually negative.
It's not like you. Is that the Naruto Uzumaki
I know so well? Sai... You'll catch a cold. How's Naruto doing? Adding a Change in Chakra Nature
to the Rasengan seems harder than imagined. Naruto isn't all that intelligent
to begin with, after all... That's why Kakashi Sensei
is having him learn this way... Yeah, training only Naruto can do... Training results are doubled
with two clones, and multiplied by a hundred
with a hundred clones... But...there's a limit. It's impossible to advance with
just effort and fortitude when one is trying to incorporate a Change in Chakra Nature
into a Jutsu... To say nothing of the fact that the Rasengan is a Jutsu invented
by the Fourth Hokage. It might not be possible
for Naruto to add a Change in Chakra Nature
to such a Jutsu... That's right.
Naruto's an idiot, after all... What? He's clumsy and tactless. There's no way he could do something
as delicate as incorporating a Change in Chakra Nature
into the Rasengan. And yet Kakashi Sensei and
Captain Yamato have been sticking it out with him all this time... And here in the village, they have formed units to fight
against the Akatsuki. It's just...a waste of manpower. I don't understand what
the Hokage can expect from a hopeless guy like Naruto... I'll pound you if you say anything else. What do you know about Naruto?! Yes, Naruto is indeed a real idiot! He's clumsy, a goof and a birdbrain! But no one does the unexpected
more than him! He's saved us countless times! Every time someone expects him to fail, he proves them wrong! That's who Naruto Uzumaki is! If you're any kind of teammate,
you'll keep that in mind! What're you grinning about? I'll pound you. Please, don't do that. But sometimes knowledge found
in books really can be useful. The "Understanding Other
People's Feelings" series...? "Words Reveal True Feelings..." Sai, you... I know that you believe in Naruto. Naruto will never let you down, Sakura. What...? You tricked me...! It would be too much for Naruto to bear
if he kept eating those awful mud balls and didn't have any results to
show for his training. What do you mean by mud balls?! I simply prioritized effectiveness
ahead of taste! Before reading into
the true feelings of others... you should learn how not to talk
about your own! It'll be fine! Naruto will pull it off! For crying out loud... Naruto... Hang in there! But I don't think it'll work this time... You have to do it anyway. Then could you look to the left
while looking to the right if someone told you to?! Indeed... That is impossible. I see... That's what this is about... Then I guess it's not outside
the realm of possibility. Huh?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! By looking to the left... while looking to the right... This is what you mean, right? I get it! Did he figure something out? Shadow Clone Jutsu! You went to the trouble of
calling us back here just to seal the Two-Tails? It will take three days.
Prepare yourselves. Three days...? This'll take forever, man.
It's raining over here. Hidan... I don't want to hear
that from you. I was this close to killing
all those Hidden Leaf idiots. And here I was just about to
make those atheists realize the existence of the Way of Jashin! The Hidden Leaf aren't atheists. They consider their predecessors
as gods and act based on the philosophy
of the will of fire. Well, I suppose we could
call something like that a justification to fight. Huh...?! You jerk! Are you insulting me? Huh?! No... I've no intention of insulting your reason for fighting in particular. I'm in the same boat as you, after all. It doesn't matter what
the reason for war is. Religion. Philosophy. Resources. Land. Grudges. Love. A whim... No matter how stupid they may be, they're all reasons worth getting
into war over. There will always be war. The reason can be dealt with later... Our Instinct is to seek out battles. Nobody's listening to
your long-winded speech! I've got my own way of doing things. I've got my own goals. I've no intention of giving up everything
for this organization! As long as you're affiliated with
the Akatsuki organization, you will collaborate with our goal. Once the Akatsuki's goal is attained, your goals will also be realized. Heh, you can act cool all you want, but that doesn't change the fact that all the Akatsuki wants
to do is make money! You're the same as Kakuzu... That's the type of reason for fighting
I hate the most. You're right... Our immediate goal is indeed money. But the Akatsuki's true goal lies
elsewhere. It will cost a large amount of money
to realize that goal. I'm the second newest member
after Tobi, so I haven't heard any of
the details from you. You just plan stuff behind my back... Heh... Are you sulking? Then I guess it's about time I told you. The Akatsuki's ultimate goal can
be accomplished in steps. And there are three steps in total... The first step is money. And the second step is
to use that money to create the first war contract organization in the history of the Shinobi world. Come on! That's the same thing
the other Shinobi villages are doing. That's just completing missions
and receiving payment. You want to become the leader of some tiny village that
no land will hire? How stupid... A village in service of the land...? You've got it all wrong... What? I'll explain it to you sequentially. LAND OF EARTH LAND OF SNOW






LAND OF FIRE


LAND OF WIND LAND OF WATER


In lands with powerful Ninja villages,
the Shinobi business assumes a significant role
in the income of these lands. You could say these Shinobi villages
earn large amounts of money and support the economy of the lands
by fighting battles both within and beyond their borders. In other words, a certain amount
of war is necessary for a land to obtain stable profit. But in this day and age,
although there are small battles, the great wars of the past are gone. The lands downsize the villages and many Shinobi
have nowhere to go. Shinobi exist to fight. That is why they are rewarded
for risking their lives for the sake of their land. The Five Great Nations are fine... Both the lands and their villages
are large and trusted. They receive several missions
from other lands and are quite stable. But it doesn't work that way
for the smaller lands. It costs a lot to maintain
a Shinobi village, and those costs remain more or less
the same in both war and peacetime. That being said, if a village is downsized
too drastically, they can't survive if
a war suddenly breaks out. So we will mobilize the necessary amount
of Shinobi only when needed without allegiance
to a land... and create an organization that,
only with the necessary forces, will take on wars from small villages
and land for money... In the beginning,
we'll fight any war for a small cost and gain control of the war trade. Then we'll use the Tailed Beasts
to create wars as big or small as the market requires. And eventually... we'll control, and have a monopoly
on all wars! In the wake of this, the Shinobi village system
of the Great Lands will collapse... and they'll have no choice
but to use the Akatsuki... And then we'll reach our true goal,
which lies ahead... The third step of our goal... We will... ...take over the world. I see... Umm... about Kurenai... Contact the relevant parties
about the funeral. I'll tell Kurenai... No... I'll do it. I'll tell her. I have a message for her
from Captain Asuma... Yes! Yeah! I'm kind of getting
the hang of it! I see... So that's what
your idea was, huh? You formed the Rasengan
by using a clone to handle the Change in Chakra Form
while you released the Chakra. Right! I just needed a third clone to handle the wind Change
in Chakra Nature. If I can't look left and right by myself... then I just needed to create clones to look left and right and
divide up the responsibility! So my Shadow Clone stunt earlier
gave you a hint, huh? That being said,
only Naruto has both the Chakra and the skill with Shadow Clones
for that method to work. I couldn't do it like that. I bet even the Fourth Hokage couldn't. But he... Just what I'd expect from the Ninja with
the most unpredictability, Naruto. I'm not sure how to say it... I've really started to take a liking to you! YIKES! Don't say gross stuff
out of the blue like that, you jerk! The Jutsu I went to the trouble of creating got messed up because
you freaked me out! Uhh, I didn't mean it like that... Whoa, stay back! I don't know quite how to say it... Well... No! For crying out loud... What're those two doing...? I have a message for you. Just a minute... What's going on? Kakashi Senpai! We must stop the training for now
and head back to the village! What?! What the heck is going on?! Asuma Sarutobi... ...is dead. You okay, Konohamaru...? Uncle Asuma... Why...?! Asuma... Choji, do you know where Shikamaru is? It looks like he isn't here yet... That's strange. And here his mom said he went out after stopping by the house... Where the heck did he go
at an important time like this...?! Next time: "Team 10"


 SARUTOBI ASUMA Asuma... Uncle Asuma... Where is Shikamaru? I thought my mom said
that he left already... Hey, I told you not to play
on the roof! - Yes.
- I'm sorry. BARBE-Q Oh, Shikamaru! Oh hello. I haven't seen you in a while,
have you been busy? Yeah. Come by again. Say "Hi" to Asuma Sensei
and Choji for me. Oh yeah, I have to ask Sensei
to pay off his balance. Um... Asuma is... Huh? He died in duty. Then, so the one that died yesterday... This can't be... Shikamaru... It's almost dinner... It's okay. I don't feel like eating. Shikamaru. Come with me for a sec. You're pretty forceful today. You can't win that way. Shut up. Akatsuki, huh?
Are they...strong? Yeah. So, what are you going to do? If Asuma couldn't beat them,
then you won't be able to do anything. He was a really good guy. Yeah. He sucked at Shogi, though. Are you sure about that? Don't mess with my move. Not that. What do you want to do? Well, I guess you're not stupid
enough to go die. As a parent,
that is very fortunate that. Who wants to go to
their son's funeral? You are doing well.
I am proud to be your parent. You're sharp, and you're talented. You are capable of taking on
the future of Hidden Leaf Village. But... Asuma died. What are you trying to say? The truth. It's repulsive that
you're talking so much! Yes, I am just a useless coward! No. Then what?! Just let it all out. Let out all your sadness,
fears, and anger... and everything else! And it all starts from there... I'll pick up your pieces... HIDDEN LEAF LIBRARY Hello! Hey! Shikamaru! Hello... It must have been hard to
deal with what happened to Asuma... I don't know what to say... Choji is also... Shikamaru. You... You want to see Choji, right? He's by the hill in the back. Sheesh! Looks like you dug deep. Huh?! Shikamaru! Your mom told me to give you this. So, when? You are gonna do it, right?! What should I do? Umm...are you telling me... Then, can I ask you to
do something for me? Yeah! YAMANAKA FLOWERS Shikamaru! You're gonna do it right?! SARUTOBI ASUMA Thank you. Sorry I'm late... But I won't hesitate anymore. We might be trying to do
something really risky... Please look after us... Asuma Sensei... Asuma Sensei... Asuma...Sensei. Are you ready? Let's go, Shikamaru. Yeah. Wait! Lady Fifth Hokage... Where are you going? The mission order is still on right? We formed a new team and
we are going to execute the mission. I will not allow selfish actions! Shikamaru, I will have you
join the new unit I form. Then, I will have you go after
we come up with a solid plan. Just send some support later. Our team has already come up
with a plan. Enough! Asuma is dead.
There are only three of you now. Asuma is with us. Are you planning to avenge him
in this battle? It's not like you.
Do you want to die in vain?! We are not that stupid.
I have no intention to die... But... But...what? I don't want to give up without
setting things straight... I don't want to live
a crappy life like that. Grow up... Death always haunts Ninja... There are times when
you can't accept a death. But, if you do not overcome it,
then there is no future! This keepsake lighter. When I have this, it's as if
Asuma Sensei is nearby... It's as if he is protecting us.
It just feels that way. Until this battle comes to an end,
this lighter will always be with us... Get real. There are only three of you.
A unit should have four members--! It's fine if there are four, right? - Huh?
- Kakashi Sensei? I will join as the captain of Team Ten.
How about that? Kakashi, you... Even if you try to stop them,
they're still gonna go. But if I go, I can supervise them... I will not allow them to go overboard. I got it. Do as you like! All right! Kakashi Sensei...
How about Naruto? Your right arm...? Forget it, he doesn't need me
at this point. Plus, there is another captain
with them. Naruto... Well then, Team Asuma, let's go! - Right!
- Yes! I appreciate it, Kakashi Sensei! So, we are now going to
confront the Akatsuki. But first, Shikamaru,
let me hear your plan. Yes, now that you've joined,
I want to change the plan a bit. I got it. Please explain. I will explain by dividing it
into several different scenarios. Depending on the situation, we will apply different maneuvers,
so be sure you listen carefully. - Got it!
- Got it! Next time:
"Target: Locked On"


 So... How is Naruto's training going? Well, according to Kakashi Sensei, it seems like he got a hold
of something. He said it's gonna take
a little longer to complete... I see... Now that Kakashi Sensei
has joined Team Ten, Team Seven...our team,
should support them because of our close alliance
with them...right? You're sharp...just as expected... But, we don't know when
Naruto will complete his new Jutsu. Wouldn't it be better to
send another team? Sakura! Tell Yamato... To have Naruto complete
his new Jutsu in 24 hours! If not, I will send another team
as reinforcements! Yes! Shizune, look at the schedule and put together a list of teams
that can go support Team Ten in case Naruto does not
complete it in time. I got it. So, it's starting. Shikamaru... Let's hear your plan first. Now that you have joined,
I want to change the plan a bit. I got it.
Please explain. I will explain by dividing it
into several scenarios. Make sure all of you listen carefully. Target: Locked On


 Huh? Kakashi Sensei and
the others went after the Akatsuki? They just left a minute ago... I see...
So what did Lady Tsunade say? She said it's best that
we go to support them... But she also said that in order to do so, we must complete
Naruto's new Jutsu immediately. Huh?!
My new Jutsu? If you don't complete it within 24 hours, then she's going to send
another team. Within 24 hours, huh... Naruto...? Oh!
You shouldn't eat that...! Huh?! Naruto... Captain Yamato,
let's start the training! Kakashi Sensei, take this... please use it
when there's an opening. I'll let you keep it. I got it. I'm impressed at how much you
observed about your opponent from just one encounter. But the other one's power
is still unknown... On top of that, you've readjusted
the plan to fit the new member... It's remarkable. That's the plan I developed with
the limited information I had. After you memorize the plans, simulate them in your head
three times or more. The success rate of
the plan highly depends on whether or not
you do image training. Yes. Okay! Okay, let's go. Yes! First, we need to find their trail. Trail... I get it, you're saying we need
to find the path between the Temple of Fire
and the Collection Office. You're saying we're going to find
their footsteps and scent there. Well, I don't think that will be easy... Let's hurry. -Yeah.
-Yes. The sealing of the Two-Tails
is now complete... There are now only four remaining...
You are dismissed. Finally! We're going to
Hidden Leaf Village, Hidan. Hidden Leaf Village...? Kakuzu, Hidan, if you are going
to Hidden Leaf Village, I will give you one warning...yes. There's a guy named Naruto Uzumaki
who's a Jinchuriki. If you see him
you should be careful...yes. Hey hey hey! Don't assume I'm the same as you,
Mr. Deidara! You are the wuss who got his arms
sewed back on by Kakuzu! It's better than his head... Hey! Hey, Kakuzu!
Who's side are you on?! Aren't we teammates? - That's why you--!
- Shut up Hidan! Let's just go. I had to sit still for three days,
I'm going to go crazy... Wait for me, bounty. Hey, where are you going, Kakuzu?
The Collection Office is this way! Are you stupid? What?! Our target is the Jinchuriki. There is no need to go back to
that place just to run into an ambush. Let's take a different route to
the Hidden Leaf Village. It has been three days. The Hidden Leaf Village should have
retrieved that bounty by now. Well, that's right. Oh yeah... What?! That scar is embarrassing.
Cover it up with this! Hey!
This is my Headband. Oh, you actually picked it up for me...? Kakuzu! You're pretty nice! Shut up Hidan!
Hurry, let's go! Oh! Hey! Wait a sec!
Hey! Kakuzu! Tell me the truth, you like me, right? If you keep talking,
I am going to kill you. Don't be shy... As expected, the trail can't be
found due to the rain. So, what are we going to do? Either way, we can't do anything
unless we find our enemy. I remember they said... We'll be right back...
Be prepared! Stay still until we get back! But obviously, they won't return
to the same place. The second team should be
monitoring the Collection Office... The one that yells a lot is fine,
but there's the other guy... I bet they will use a different route, but they have only one destination. Whether they are going after
Asuma's corpse for money or they are after Naruto,
their destination is Hidden Leaf Village! Then that means, it'll be a wide search... How are we going to find them? We'll go with that. Huh?! Got it. I found them. There's no mistake...they're headed
straight to Hidden Leaf Village. Shoot! Are you all right, Ino?! That was close! Did they notice?! I think it's okay. As expected, they're headed to
Hidden Leaf Village through a different route. They're in the 2 o'clock direction.
We will run into them in ten minutes. What happened, Kakuzu?! Naw, nothing... It's just my imagination... Then let's hurry. Yeah... All right. Let's go! - Hidan...
- Yeah... - Damn it!
- It's a Paper Bomb! Kakuzu! I hardened my arm.
I'm not injured. Forget that, watch out for the shadow... I won't fall for it twice! Hidan, look up! It's another Paper Bomb! Hidan, dodge it! It didn't explode?! They got us... Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu...
A success. I can't move. You bastard... I dodged the shadow,
so how did you... The thing I threw is a Chakra Blade. I bet you know that it's made
from a special metal that absorbs the user's Chakra characteristics. Kakuzu, what is he saying? Idiot! Shut up, Hidan. Due to the Chakra absorbed, it exhibits power based
on the user's Jutsu. Basically, the Chakra Blade itself is exhibiting my Shadow Possession Jutsu. That Chakra Blade is a memento
of Asuma, the man you killed. 35 million ryo, huh...? Asuma... If I were to equate
Hidden Leaf Ninja to Shogi pieces, Shikamaru... In the end, you would be a knight. Why? Although weak in strength,
a knight can advance by jumping over pieces... Its unique movement resembles
your flexible thinking. I see... This Paper Bomb is a fake.
It's just paper... His aim was this Chakra Blade
 from the beginning... Because of that, the first Kunai Knife
with the Paper Bomb was a diversion to ensure that
we'd dodge the second Chakra Blade. Furthermore,
he used his shadow... to make us focus
our attention on our feet. He did it to make us
realize his attack from above and make us dodge it at the last minute in order to ensure that
he could grab hold of our shadows. He's pretty clever. Well, let's finish this. Hey!
Why the hell have you been so quiet?! What are you doing getting caught, too?! Hey! Hey! Hey! To tell the truth, aren't we pretty screwed?! Screwed? According to my plan, it was finished
from the moment I caught you. You did a good job... You bastard... Damn it!
What are you doing?! There's no way I'm gonna miss
the second time. I'm going to corner you guys. You jerks went after us
in the wrong order. I'm not going to mess up
the order this time. Damn it! I know your face now! No matter what happens to me,
I'm gonna kill you. You're stupid, aren't you? Kakuzu! Dodge it! All right! What's happening? I didn't expect his arm to
move on its own after being separated
from his body... But when did this happen? It was when
I attacked with the paper bomb! While he was in the smoke,
he put this right arm in the ground... Just what I'd expect
of the Akatsuki. They all use insane abilities! You said we were finished, but my powers are still unknown to you. So you kept your distance when you
made your next move. You're intelligent, unlike my partner. But even if you
analyze the fight, it doesn't mean everything
will go as planned. Kakuzu! What do mean
"unlike my partner"? Just as I said, you idiot. Damn it!
My body...! Kakuzu, do something! I can't believe you're forcing me back. Shoot! Now, Choji! Spiky Human Boulder! Kakuzu! What's the meaning of this? Why?
He got hit by Kakashi Sensei's attack! Yeah, you're right.
We definitely crushed his heart... What's with his back?
I sense some very bad Chakra. It's finally a serious situation. - Be careful, Choji.
- Got it! Either way, that Kakuzu guy
seems like he has a lot to share. Next time: "Kakuzu's Abilities"


 I can't believe his arm
could move on its own after being separated from his body... But when did this happen? Was it back when
I attacked with a Paper Bomb? He hid in the smoke and
sent his right arm underground... Tsk! Just what I'd expect of the Akatsuki. They all use insane abilities! You said we were finished,
but my powers are still unknown to you. You keep your distance when
you make your next move. You're intelligent, unlike my partner. Damn it! My body...! Do something, Kakuzu! Oh no! Now, Choji! Spiky Human Boulder! Kakuzu! S-Such power... It seems Naruto hasn't rested at all. There's no choice. He has to complete his new Jutsu and then we have to head out to
back up Kakashi Sensei and the others... The time limit is 24 hours, huh? It'll be tough, but all we can do
is believe in Naruto. After all, there's nobody who
can work as smoothly with Kakashi Sensei and
the others as us. Kakuzu's Abilities


 All right. It's almost complete. And now...
I can catch up to Sasuke. Indeed you can... However, watch out for Sasuke's
fire Change in Chakra Nature. Huh?! I guess I should explain the comparative strengths of
the Five Great Changes in Nature to you. What are...comparative strengths? Well, put simply, I guess it means
the five changes in Chakra natures of fire, water,
earth, lightning and wind are each connected and
have comparative strengths. So...what does that mean? It's easier to explain with a diagram. There are five main
Changes in Chakra Natures. First you draw... FIRE
WATER             WIND
EARTH       LIGHTNING
- ...the five in a circle.
- Right. And...for example,
take the first one, fire... I'll draw comparative strengths
and weaknesses in this diagram. This fire Change in Chakra Nature is
strong against the wind next to it, but weak against water
on the other side. The Five Great Changes in Nature have strengths and weaknesses
in relationship to each other. Uh...Okay. So? He's not getting it... Simply put... Naruto... your Wind Style Jutsu is weaker than
Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu in relationship. Huh?! Only Water Style can beat Fire Style. Why can't Wind Style beat Fire Style? It may be quicker to imagine them. Wood burns hotter when wind blows. However, the fire can be put out
when water is poured on it. That means if you strike
one of Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu... with a Wind Jutsu of the same strength, it'd backfire by making
the fire even larger. However, look at
the relationship of wind. Wind is indeed weak against fire,
but it is strong against lightning. In other words,
that means your new Jutsu... will be strong against Sasuke's
Lightning Style Chidori. Naruto... It's a good thing you don't have
the earth Change in Chakra Nature. So I'm a good match with Sasuke, huh? Yes, only wind can defeat lightning. No, that's not what I meant. Hmm? I mean only the power of wind
can help fire by making it an even larger power. Yeah, that's right... Naruto! You're awesome. Yeah! It looks like your training
is going well. I guess. Then you'll be finished soon, right? Yeah. No, just a minute. Could you give me a little more time? There's still something
I want to test out. What's going on? I knew it.
It's just as Raido Senpai said... It might be a Jutsu
for hardening his body. That's his power... Nice analysis... That's right.
No physical attack will work on me. I'd projected their powers
to a certain degree, but this... If we can't use direct attacks,
what should we do? Shikamaru... Be afraid, you atheist jerks! All right! It's about time for us
to counterattack! Kakuzu, break this Jutsu already! Sure... It can't be... You snuck up behind me...
without me sensing you... Too bad... Be afraid, you atheist jerks! All right! It's about time for us
to counterattack! Kakuzu, break this Jutsu already! Sure... It can't be... You snuck up behind me
without me sensing you... Too bad... Awesome. What?! What's up with that?! I thought physical attacks
weren't supposed to work on you! Yeah! How did you get
behind him, Kakashi Sensei?! I saw everything. I saw the Jutsu you use
for hardening your body. Judging from how you formed
your seal earlier, I'd say you've got an
earth Change in Chakra Nature. In that instant...
you read the speed of my seal? And using Lightning Style at this level... I see!
You're...the Sharingan Kakashi... Earth is weak against lightning... We're not a good match...
You're finished. Kakashi Sensei is awesome,
sure enough! Now there's just the other one! In an instant...
Just what I'd expect from Kakashi Sensei! Yeah. We needed to take care
of the mortal one first... It'd be trouble, after all. You okay, Shikamaru? This isn't looking good. Kakashi Sensei! His Shadow Possession
has reached its limit, huh? He nailed your heart in one shot? How can you get hammered
right off the bat like that?! For crying out loud... You're next. It's over! Oh, boy. And here you acted all cool and
said, "You're finished." What's going on...? I'm sure I didn't miss the vital spot. All right, let's settle this right now. I intend to! My Shadow Possession
has reached its limit... Hey, Shikamaru.
What's happening? And why didn't he die even though...
the Lightning Blade nailed him? Who knows...? But with these guys,
it would take a lot to surprise me now. Oh, boy... I can finally move... What're...those? Now...shall we do this, Kakuzu? Sure... Wh-What're those?! That Chakra feels awful... Lord Jashin! Watch me! I'm going to get serious! I mean it! I'll rip out their guts! Watch out, Choji! Right. What...? Kakuzu! Hey! Hey! Hey! One of them died right after
our verbal assault! God, you really stink! Since one of the masks that
came out of his body died... it must've been that mask I hit
with my Lightning Blade earlier. Looks like we got something here. Hidan, stand down for a while.
I'll take care of this. Hey... Just a minute! We've been getting our butts kicked
the whole time and it's ticking me off. Let's go with the usual. Wind Style: Pressure Damage! Choji! Watch out! Kakashi Sensei! Kakashi Sensei! No way...
He even attacked his own partner?! I get it! He's taking advantage
of the immortality! Here he comes, Choji! No... If they are hit head-on with that... Choji, Shikamaru! Run! Lightning Style: False Darkness! I won't make it in time! Look out! Kakashi Sensei...! Are you okay? Well...somehow, I guess... These guys...are powerful... That masked guy in particular... But no one should be able
to use such high-level Jutsu unless they are compatible with
that person's own Chakra nature. And he uses earth, wind and lightning... What the heck is going on? I'm surprised... You're the first one we weren't able
to kill with this combination... Kakashi...Hatake. So you read it with your Sharingan, huh? However...
How about this next attack?! What?! Fire Style: Searing Migraine! Our best plan would be
to attack them separately. If we're going to do that,
we'll need to stall Hidan... Then I'll do it with
my Mind Transfer Jutsu. No. It's too risky. Then I'll do it. That won't do, either. We'll be finished if we approach him
and he gets some of our blood. But... I'll capture him by myself...
And I'll fulfill that role. Next time:
"The Terrifying Secret"


 Fire Style: Searing Migraine! He can even use the Fire Style? Choji! Ino! You guys okay? Yes! Yeah...! You're pretty good, just as I thought... Kakashi Sensei! Are you okay? Yeah... That being said, I've used four Lighting Blade shots
while using the Sharingan... I can't be sitting idly by. They're using really good combos. And here Kakashi Sensei definitely
nailed him with the Lightning Blade... Why won't he die? I'm sure I crushed his heart.
He really should be dead. But what I killed was one
of the monsters that came out of his body. We can assume that it died
in place of his real body. It was the same when he broke
my Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu... Something that looked like
a heart was attached to the arm that had been
separated from his body and it was moving on its own. What...does that mean? If you include his real body, each monster that came out of his body
has a heart, and they are all his. In other words,
it means he probably has five hearts. What?! How can he...? However, he lost one of them to
Sensei's Lightning Blade just now, though. Then that means we have
to crush his other four hearts in order to take him out completely? Yeah... You're very perceptive.
That's exactly right... I took each of these hearts
from Shinobi I once fought. I can always replenish my stock... with your hearts. I get it... By connecting his Chakra Network
to the others' hearts, he incorporates their Chakra natures
as well, huh? No wonder he's able to
use several different natures. By the way, does the Hidden Leaf Village
bury their dead? Burials are a pain in the neck, you see. I bet Kakuzu's going to say, "We're going to dig up the body
and exchange him for money." And here I thought I could have
some fun with that bearded jerk... He was nothing special, after all. You're one to talk, especially since
you got your head chopped off... Shut up. You keep quiet! I'm sure you guys are intent
on revenge. But you guys are too weak for that. You all look like kids.
I guess you were his students, huh? Well, with scum like him as your teacher,
you won't amount to much. Don't insult Asuma Sensei! Choji. Beautiful loving bonds between
student and teacher, huh? Heh, how stupid! You jerk...! Choji! What's so great about an idiot like that? Fatty?! Choji! You idiot! What's the point of getting stirred up
by such an obvious trick?! I-I'm sorry... Choji! At this rate... Die. Little girl... Shikamaru! You small fries. Die. It's over for you, too. WATER Oh, boy. How pathetic... You okay? Y-Yeah... Somehow. You're pathetic, man.
What a disgrace. You, too. How could you not realize
it was a Shadow Clone? Uh-oh... You saw that? Shikamaru... How shall we fight? Let's separate those two. Our best plan would be to
attack them separately. Yeah. After we eliminate their ability
to do combo attacks, we'll focus on destroying
his four remaining hearts. If we're going to do that,
we'll need someone to stall Hidan... I'll do it! I have the most Chakra
stored up right now. And I won't be of much use
in straight attacks... I'll use my Mind Transfer Jutsu... No! The Mind Transfer is
primarily a Combo Jutsu used after stopping an opponent's movements
with my Shadow Possession. If you miss, you won't be able to return to
your own body for several minutes. It's too risky! I'll do it. - Huh?
- What?! We'll separate them after I restrain him
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu. But how do you plan on restraining him? We'll need a diversion, either way. Then I'll take care of that. That won't do, either! You'll be finished if he attacks you
and gets even a little of your blood. It'll be just like before. It'd be a bad move for us to
approach him and attack! Choji. You store up Chakra to take out
the masked guy with Kakashi Sensei. Right! I'll capture him by myself. And... I'll fulfill that role! I'll capture him by myself. And... I'll fulfill that role! Got it. I'll leave it to you, Shikamaru. Take this. Right... That again?! Are you that afraid of my powerful scythe? I'm your opponent. Hey-hey-hey! Sneaking around like that from a distance? How pathetic! Too slow! What--?! He picked it up...
and threw it with his shadow?! He can't move in midair! He's ours! You wish! If I just focus on the shadow,
a Jutsu like this is worthless! What? I'm not just sneaking around
from a distance! The Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success. You...jerk! Go, Shikamaru! Leave this to us! We're counting on you! Right... Let's take a nice little walk... just the two of us. Hey, where are we going? Are you trying to separate me
from Kakuzu?! You...jerk! Shouldn't someone go with him? You're really underestimating Hidan. And here that kid called Shikamaru
or whatever... would've become a bounty
of high value someday. Now... he's dead. But your decision was the right one. I'm...powerful. There's a great difference in battle experience
between you guys and myself. Seeing those headbands reminds me of the first Hidden Leaf Shinobi
I ever fought... The First Hokage. What? How old is this guy?! Are you really immortal? No. Something like that
doesn't exist in this world... It's just that I can keep on living... I maintain a stock by taking
the hearts of those I kill before my own runs out of life... So you won't let me get away, huh? This shadow technique...
only lasts about five minutes, right? And it's just the two of us... That works out well for me, too. You idiot! The Fire Style and Wind Style masks? I can stock five hearts including my own... Kakashi... I will take your heart...
to replace the one you took from me! Everything's ready... I've waited for this... Die! It appears you had no doubt
your partner would win. But you guys really
underestimated Shikamaru. This is a battle he himself
was determined to fight. No way would he let the information
Asuma left behind, at the cost of his own life, go to waste... Everything's a Shogi match. The whole time, you guys were
just being manipulated according to our Shogi diagram! Next time:
"Shikamaru's Genius"


 So you won't let me get away, huh? This shadow technique only lasts
about five minutes, right? And it's just the two of us... That works out well for me, too.
You idiot! I can stock five hearts including my own. Kakashi... I will take your heart to
replace the one you took from me! Everything's ready... The two separate bodies merged. So the Fire Style...
and Wind Style masks merged, huh? Kakashi... I will take your heart to
replace the one you took from me! That one, huh?! He's trying to force me
into an open area where he can shoot me down, huh? Is that your idea of hiding? - Sensei!
- Sensei! Shikamaru's Genius


 You did a good job of
hiding this time, Kakashi. But do you have the courage to
show yourself before us again? Not again! Water Style: Water Wall! Fire with the wind Change
in Chakra Nature added to it... can't be put out just
with Water Style, huh? Looks like I'll have to confront him
at close range, after all. Kakashi Sensei! It appears you didn't get around to watching out for my movements. Your heart...is mine. Die! How about that...?
It's addicting pain, isn't it? I'm counting on you... Shikamaru... How worthless... Lord Jashin must be disappointed... Now... Kakazu must be about finished
by now, too... Wh-What did you do? It seems...
he made it just in time... I-Impossible! Time to go... Not deep enough?! You jerk... Why are you alive?! You jerk...
Why are you alive? I just pretended... I was dead. The blood on that weapon...isn't mine. It's your partner's blood. I-Impossible... Yes, it is possible. Your own blood was used
for your partner's ritual. So, Kakashi Sensei, here... Please use it when there is a chance. I'll let you keep it. Shikamaru knew his opponent's ability
utilized blood, after all. He'd prepared capsules
of blood in advance. What does that mean? Anyone would've been fine... If given an opportunity,
we needed to get your partner's blood. In this capsule, you see... It can't be...
When did you have the chance?! When I put a hole inside you
with my Lightning Blade... I took your blood at the same time. I'll capture him by myself. And... And I'll fulfill that role... So I took it...and my role was to trap you. Hey, where are we going? Are you trying to separate me
from Kakuzu?! You...jerk! Shouldn't someone go with him? You're really underestimating Hidan. And here, that kid called Shikamaru
or whatever... would've become a bounty
of high value someday. Today...he dies. Heh. That was...our strategy. You jerk...! No way... That kid... He planned that far ahead... That's about the size of it. You should've handled him
more carefully... You guys really underestimated him. There's no way he would
let the information that cost Asuma his own life
go to waste. You guys who take peoples' lives
without hesitation could probably never understand
how he feels. Kakashi Sensei! Are you okay? Well...somehow I guess. I can't believe they invaded
his body this much in such a short period of time. If Shikamaru had taken any longer... Slowly! Make sure not to damage
the vessels. I'll treat you immediately
with my Medical Ninjutsu. The treatment can wait! What?! Here they come! Expansion Jutsu! Super Slap! Nice! Good one, Choji! Choji! What?! Oh no! What?! He came back to life? He absorbed the Lightning Style
monster's heart. What's that...? His main body's a monster, too. Two of my hearts...gone. It's been a long time...
since that happened... Even I can tell,
and I'm not all that bright... It's been so many times already. Any idiot could figure out your Jutsu
after seeing it so many times. What did you say? It seems your Jutsu isn't as strong
as it was before. I didn't even need five minutes... I can move! The endurance of your Jutsu power
and its effect gradually decreases each time
you use it. Basically, the longer you use it,
the weaker it gets. Aren't you just about out of Chakra? Huh?! You won't get away...this time. Here he comes! - Right!
- Right! He's fast! Damn it! I can't move...! Kakashi Hatake... I was going to replace the hearts
I lost with yours... But I've changed my mind... I can get more hearts
anytime I want, after all... Die! Wind Style: Rasengan! Water Style: Ripping Torrent! Hurricane Vortex Jutsu! Sorry...we're late. Perfect timing... Do you know what those words mean? It means if you curse someone
and attempt to kill them, you will also be killed in retribution,
so two burial pits are necessary. You cursed and killed my teacher. Don't think you guys can
just romp about carefree... That's your burial pit. Next time:
"When You Curse Someone,
You Dig Your Own Grave"

 You won't get away...this time... Here he comes! - Right!
- Right! He's fast! Damn it! I can't move. Kakashi Hatake... I was planning to replace the hearts
I lost with yours... but I changed my mind. I can get more hearts anytime I want,
after all... Die! Wind Style: Rasengan! Water Style: Ripping Torrent! - Hurricane Vortex Jutsu!
- Hurricane Vortex Jutsu! Sorry...we're late. Perfect timing... Thanks for the support... Sakura...Sai...and Naruto. I've never seen you this beat. Sorry about that. This enemy...must be pretty strong. When You Curse Someone,
You Dig Your Own Grave

 More strange people... And he is pretty messed up already... Naruto, are you okay? Where is Shikamaru? He's a little ways off
fighting the other enemy. I want two of you to
head towards Shikamaru. Preferably, a long-distance fighter
and a medic. I'll take care of it. All right! Sai and Sakura follow Pakkun's lead
and support Shikamaru! Yes! Yes. Hah! What's this unorganized gang
trying to do? Now there're more hearts for me
to choose from. From here on, this one's mine. Naruto... We're off! Naruto, I leave it to you! Did you...complete it? No...only about 50 percent. I see... But... Well, just watch. Naruto is not the same person
he used to be. This way! Either way... To go against an opponent
who killed Asuma alone... Is Shikamaru-kun... I mean,
Shikamaru going to be all right? Shikamaru is fine. He is...the most intelligent Shinobi
in the Land of Fire. Plus... Okay... Well then, let's go. Sheesh... He has absolutely no interest. I can't believe he's a sub-captain. Don't say that. It's difficult for him
to show any interest. In fact, I bet he hates showing it. He's trying really hard
to show disinterest. I don't get it...
Lady Tsunade, aren't you overrating him? I think I am still underrating him... This is...? We recently received an official offer
from a Feudal Lord in the Land of Fire... They want Shikamaru as a member of
the Feudal Lord's personal guard division. It seems Shikamaru's role as an administrator during
the last Chunin exam caught the attention of
one of the lord's assistants. That means... Yes. The guard's division is like
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. This means a lot. Amazing... Then did Shikamaru...?
Accept the offer? That boy... I heard you rejected
the Feudal Lord's offer. Yeah... It's not a bad idea to experience
the world outside. I don't think I'd be here now... if I had not been part of
the Guardian Shinobi Twelve. It doesn't matter. I hate tedious stuff
and that won't change in the future. It's just that... How should I put it... It's because I'm concerned about
Choji and Ino... and the other guys in the unit.
And well, Naruto... So I'm just hanging around. I see...
You also have the Will of Fire. The Will of Fire...
The thing the Third used to talk about? That's right. It refers to the strong will
of wanting to protect this village. It's nothing that noble. Don't be shy. You're concerned about them,
so you want to protect them, right? We're all Ninja of the Leaf. It's bound to happen, even though
it's not really my thing. The Will of Fire shines upon the village. Well, that's what my dad told me. Then, I'll shine light on you someday.
Just kidding. No need to worry about Shikamaru. Besides, this is the battle to
avenge Asuma Sensei. Shikamaru should be fighting the enemy
with a perfect plan. I can move...! I can move...! Damn it... If you had believed in Lord Jashin, you may have gotten a helping hand
in your time of need. If you'll believe in Lord Jashin
from now on... to honor your reformation... As if I'd forgive you! Idiot! I don't care about his forgiveness. Shadow Pull Jutsu! Y-You...! I still have this much...Chakra left. You... Wh-What are you doing?! Just watch... What?! What happened?!
When did you do this...?! I had this trap prepared beforehand. So he didn't just separate us on a whim,
but he purposely lured me here? Then...this was all his plan! When you curse someone,
you dig two holes. You know what that means? What?! If you curse to kill someone,
you also get killed in retribution, that's why you need
two holes for the burial. You cursed and killed my teacher. Don't think I'll let you
get away free and easy. This hole is your grave. I am not gonna die... Even if my body is dismembered
into pieces and only my head remains, I am going to drag myself out
and eat your throat! What? Deer? These woods are a special place
in the Land of Fire. Our family is the only ones allowed in.
No one else comes here. Our family will always
keep an eye on you. You did a great job, Shikamaru. Yeah... My Will of Fire...is now yours. You, why...are you turning that on? It's the Will of Fire...
the will to protect our village. Good bye...Sensei. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Multiple Shadow Clones... I see... You are the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki. What's the situation
and the enemy's power? The enemy is two Akatsuki. As I said before,
Shikamaru is fighting one of them... and the other one is in front of us. This guy has the power to split. Those two masks on the shoulders
split from the torso. Each mask has a separate heart
and moves independently. He originally had five hearts.
He lost two and has only three now. What do you mean? I've killed him twice already. We need to kill him three more times
to finish him off. Plus, he's an intermediate
distance fighter and can use
multiple Change in Chakra Natures. No wonder you were
having a hard time... Naruto! I heard it! Naruto! It's no use charging in recklessly! You can only make Shadow Clones?
You can't beat me with that. Based on his attack speed
and fighting style, I need at least three Shadow Clones
to distract him. He gathered each clones' experience
and processed it... and based on that,
he formed a simulation. His ability to use
Shadow Clones has advanced. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Three Shadow Clones... What's...that? What a...high pitched...Chakra! What...are they...? I tried my best...
to build it up to here. All right... To test its ability, let's collide it
with my Rasengan. Get ready. What?! If we do that,
what's gonna happen? If the Jutsu is near completion,
my Rasengan will have no effect. Now let's do it...! The Fourth...?! What...is that Jutsu...?! If I get hit by that...then I'm...
definitely doomed. Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! I know teamwork is important. I also know the path ahead is
a dangerous one. But right now, I want to take
that dangerous path alone! If I can't reach the other end,
I will always remain a kid. So don't take that path away from me. Next time:
"Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken"

 It's cold! I'm bored. When does Team Eight's
stand-by order end? It can't be helped, because
Kurenai Sensei is in mourning. I know! I know but... Team Ten left on a mission to
avenge Asuma Sensei. And Naruto seems like he is training
to complete his new Jutsu. What?! Naruto is working hard. You're blushing. Huh? Ahhh, it's nothing... It's nothing... I see, then that's fine...
Let's go by Kurenai Sensei's place! Let's go, Akamaru. K-Kiba, wait! Kiba! I'm alone again, huh? I have it all to myself... Ah, this sky is too big. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Three Shadow Clones...? What's that?! What a...high pitched...Chakra! What...are they? What is that Jutsu?! If I get hit with that...then I'm...
definitely doomed. Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! This is the end! - Yes!
- Yes! I'll back him up, too! No! Don't get close to Naruto,
or you'll also get caught! So this is the power of
the Nine-Tailed Fox's Jinchuriki... A fitting Jutsu for a monster. What?! Damn--! What...? What? Did he win? Failed... Wind Style:
Rasen Shuriken

 Always the unpredictable Ninja.
He did it again... - Yamato!
- Right! I'll take your heart. Damn! Damn it! Gee... Acting really tough... That is so Naruto... Since it was called Rasen Shuriken
or whatever, I thought you'd let it fly... Do you have to actually run and punch? Hey! When it hits the target,
it causes some serious damage! It's called the Rasen Shuriken, but... you must hit at point-blank range. That's why this Jutsu relies on
Shadow Clones as a diversion. The duration of this
new Jutsu is too short. It only lasted a couple seconds. Exactly. You'll never hit the target with that. Not against someone like him. That Nine-Tailed kid's Jutsu... It seemed very powerful... but I'll be safe as long
as I keep my distance. As long as I avoid close-range combat
and watch the one using that Jutsu, I have nothing to fear. Please let me try one more time. I'll finish him with my new Jutsu. You're against that "Akatsuki"! If you do the same thing,
he'll just dodge it again! If he detects our diversion,
we're done for. Let's fight him together... That's true... Our current situation,
it's five against one. There's no need to take chances. So...what's their next move? Kakashi Sensei... Do you remember what
you told me when I was training? You said you believe
I'm the only Shinobi who can surpass the Fourth Hokage. Naruto... I know teamwork is important. I also know that
this is a very risky path. Even so, I want to take this risk alone. If I can't beat this,
I'll never be able to grow up. So please... Please... don't take this path away from me. Yamato, what do you think? Yeah... You haven't even seen it yet,
after all. You haven't seen how
he's a completely different Naruto now. Then it's settled... Shikamaru... Pakkun! What was that?! They're close! This is a sorry state... How dare you do this to me?! Lord Jashin will punish you for this! A greater judgment will be
handed down by Jashin himself! That doesn't scare me. We believe in different things. I believe in the Will of Fire. But your god is not that stupid Jashin
or anything. Now...I will hand down judgment... You jerk...! I told you, judgment will be handed down
to you by Lord Jashin! And I will carry out that judgment!
I only need teeth to take care of you! I'll chew you up into little pieces! We found you! Reinforcements, huh?
But you were just a bit too late... Wh-What?! Shikamaru...
You defeated an Akatsuki by yourself? You're more impressive than I thought. I guess... I just had to do this myself,
no matter what. That's right... What's happening with the others? We came straight here, so... Let's rejoin them quickly. Shikamaru! Hey, are you okay?
I'll heal you right now. This is no big deal... But...! I don't like troublesome things
that hurt my friends. Let's hurry. Yeah. Guys, please be okay... Go, Naruto. Right! That kid's going to attack again...? Just to be safe, I should switch
to a long-range attack style. He didn't just change
the shape of his body. He's built up quite a bit of Chakra. It's to counter Naruto's Jutsu. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here he comes... It's ready! He flew! I can ignore the diversionary
Shadow Clones behind me. I just need to aim for the original. I've nothing to fear if
I can just smash that Jutsu... No! He's reading him! I knew he'd go with a long-range attack! Naruto! All right! What?! That was a Shadow Clone?! Huh?! He mixed himself in with
the diversionary Clones! Eat this! The blast is coming! That was an extraordinary amount
of attacks. I couldn't even count them all
with the Sharingan. What a Jutsu... - Awe...
- Awesome. Naruto... You... You...finally... All right... I did it. Shizune, did you notice that? You mean Naruto, right? Yes. I wonder what it is. I've seen various cases up until now. But I've never seen anything like that. What's happening with
the body Kakashi brought back? I have already sent it for an autopsy. Tell the person in charge
to give it top priority! Next episode:
"The Price of Power" How're you guys doing? This is what we're going to try today. LET'S ALL TRY IT!
SUMMONING JUTSU
A summoning Jutsu. Summoning Jutsu? Yes! It's a space-time Jutsu where you make a contract with an animal
and summon them whenever you want. You guys haven't made
a contract with an animal yet, so we'll just practice the seals today! These are the seals you'll need... Boar! Dog! Rooster! Monkey! Sheep! Then you build up Chakra and
slam your hand down on the spot where you want
to summon your animal. It's important to do it correctly
and not rush. Now, let's all give it a try! Okay. Boar! Dog! Rooster!
Monkey! Sheep! Slam your hand down. Hi! I'm Pakkun.
I rushed here since I was summoned! - Ooh!
- Awesome! To succeed, all you need is patience,
effort and training! It's not like Naruto could summon
the Chief Toad right from the start. Train hard and master the Jutsu! Okay, bye-bye! Hey, he's still down. Naruto! Naruto, are you all right? Okay, Choji keep him still like that. Right now, I can only give
emergency first-aid. But, who would've guessed... that the original was hidden
among the clones. You're not up to
Shikamaru's level... but I guess you're pretty smart, Naruto. Don't compare me with Shikamaru... But I'm impressed that you were able to fire off
your new Jutsu three times. Even during training,
two was the limit. His quick thinking in making
his next move after failing only once... His unshakable confidence... Naruto has truly become strong. Perfecting, to this level, the Jutsu that even the Fourth Hokage
could not master... Looks like it's time to put
our trust in the next generation. He's surpassed me... Do you feel it? You're the one Naruto always
envisions before him. You are making him steadily stronger... Isn't that so, Sasuke? Sir, we should get going... Yeah... Can you move? All right, everyone. Let's go back to
the Hidden Leaf Village. Where's Kakashi Sensei? Tying up loose ends... How could I lose...
to young brats like you...? Well, you're someone who's fought
against the First Hokage... so we may seem like kids to you. But to us,
you're just a washed-up old man. That's why you're near death
and groveling at our feet. One after another,
a new generation will succeed us. Good work, everyone. The immediate danger has passed,
but the Akatsuki still remain... Do not let down your guard. Naruto, those wounds are...? Yeah, my badge of honor. We did some emergency treatment... Just in case, get it checked thoroughly
at the Leaf Hospital. Nah, I don't need... Yes, you do! Don't worry, Master. I'll take full responsibility
and take him there. - Got it, Naruto?
- Yes! All right then, I order you
to take a few days off. Rest your minds and
your bodies. Dismissed! Did you notice? Yes. You mean about Naruto's wound? I wonder what it could be? I've never seen anything like it... What happened to the Akatsuki corpse
that Kakashi brought back? Well, it's already been sent
to the coroner. Then send a message to
whoever's in charge. Make it a top priority
and put a rush on it. It's finally over... Uh-huh. Sorry. Huh? I'll part with you guys here. But your house is this way... I have something to do... What is it? Now now. Asuma Sarutobi Is it okay to be up and about? Shikamaru! Your shogi partner is gone... You were Asuma's favorite, so it will be lonely for you... From precious things to silly things...
he taught me so much. Shogi was one of them. I'd be lying if I said
I didn't feel lonely. But I'm no longer allowed
to act like a little kid ... I can't keep crying. I always complain about
what a bother things are, and because of that,
I messed up a lot as a kid. And each time,
Asuma was there to protect me... Maybe that's why... although he was such
an evasive and odd teacher... To me, he was a super cool grown-up. And that's why...
this time it's my turn. When that child is born, it'll be my turn to be
a protective teacher... So I've gotta become
a cool grown-up too. Thank you... Boy, Pops.
Unlike Asuma, you're good... ...A Climbing Silver attack, eh? What you'd call a necessary sacrifice to protect the King
against a higher opponent. If you escape there,
then a knight will come here. So whichever the pawn runs to,
your bishop will be supported... Sheesh, that knight sure is
a nasty move there... Well, if you're to compare
a Hidden Leaf Ninja to shogi pieces, I'm a knight. What does that mean? Asuma said so. I guess Asuma knew
your personality very well. Then, who would be the King? Then do you know who the King is? Isn't it the Hokage? Until recently, I thought so too...
But it wasn't... Then, who is it? When the time comes,
you'll realize it too. The children who will be taking over
the future Hidden Leaf Village... They are the King. You know what it's all about. All right, checkmate. You don't have enough power
to protect the King yet. You better work harder! Damn! You're so reckless...! Don't get so upset... And don't talk back! Scrapes and bruises...
these injuries aren't too serious... The real problem is this arm. It's broken in several places. His body isn't able to withstand
his Jutsu. I see... So that's the conclusion of
the coroner's team about Kakuzu? Yes... Although they're not
completely finished yet... In any case, we must notify
the supervising Jonin about this. What will you do? Summon Kakashi and Yamato
to the coroner's room. I see... So Hidan and Kakuzu are dead. Yes. It seems they were killed
by Naruto's team. Oh...? We thought they would take down
another Akatsuki if we let them live... Seems like it went quite well. Not bad at all. I'm sure even the Akatsuki
would never have expected to lose two of their members
at once. Still, they now have the Two-Tails. Maybe we should give an extra push
to bring down their strengths. How is that child? Yes. I'm planning a final test
in a few days. But judging from the data,
I'm certain there is no mistake. I'm looking forward to it. Just a little more until
 the final step. But for that,
one more pawn is essential. Say, Kabuto. That woman... Would you bring her here? That woman? The autopsy is not complete yet... Coroner's Office 1

But as we examined the corpse, we figured something out
about Naruto's new Jutsu. The damage this fellow sustained
was caused by something totally different
from the usual barrage of hits. What do you mean? Every Chakra Network connecting
his body cells has been severed. His Chakra Network...?! Yes. A condition like this
is usually unimaginable. Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken...
is this powerful...? Rather than an offensive attack,
this works more like poison. A microscopic attack that inflicts
damage at the cellular level... I'm assuming that
the Wind Chakra changed in Chakra Form
into infinite small blades... attacking all the cells
within his body. What a Jutsu... Hmm... Poison... Rather than the number of attacks, it should be described as
a concentrated attack. And the user of the Jutsu, Naruto, is... That's the problem. I see... Kakashi... This new Jutsu...
The Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken. Forbid Naruto from using it again. It's that serious...?! The same condition afflicts
Naruto's right hand. Although it's not nearly
as bad as this one. If he continues using
this new Jutsu, Naruto will lose his ability
to mold Chakra. With such a powerful Jutsu,
there's sure to be risks. If the cells are disconnected
from the body's Chakra Network, even my medical skills
won't cure him. Be certain to emphasize that
to Naruto. Of all things, he wants
to summon that woman... That was a rude welcome... Guren. Oh, it's just you, Kabuto.
I thought it was an intruder. You did that on purpose, didn't you? Of course not. Besides, I wouldn't want
someone who'd die so easily to be standing beside
Lord Orochimaru! Leaf Hospital All right, done. Now you just have to take it easy. Thanks, Sakura. Say, Naruto. This new Jutsu. Use it only
when absolutely necessary. Do not  use it too often! Don't worry.
If you can make it better- I'm not talking about that! Medical Ninjutsu cannot heal
everything right away! But this kind of makes me happy. Huh? I feel like you and I are
getting closer to Sasuke. Geez... Lady Tsunade... we received word from
an Anbu Black Ops sent to another nation. This is...!
Where is Kakashi right now? He is probably with Naruto. That's fine. Tell him to report immediately
once he's done with his business. Could it be
a lead to Orochimaru? Yes. It seems they were a step away
before being attacked. We must select members for
a search team to be sent off immediately. Next time:
"A Shinobi's Resolve"


 Special News Bulletin:
Closing in on
the Akatsuki Organization's secret Hidden Leaf News Satellite






Today, this man is going to talk
about the secret "Akatsuki organization." Hello, I'm Yamato. First of all, how many members
does the Akatsuki organization have? It's said there used to be ten members. Clashed and Left  

Later, Orochimaru who clashed
with Itachi left the organization. Dead

Furthermore, Sasori of the Red Sand
was killed in a battle with Granny Chiyo. Dead or Neutralized

And Kakuzu and Hidan were either killed
or neutralized after their battle against Shikamaru
and his team, so there are currently six members left. Of those left, the next four's faces
and names are identified. Itachi Uchiha.
Hoshigaki Kisame. Deidara. Zetsu. The remaining two are still unknown
as we continue to investigate. In order to discover Akatsuki's
ultimate goal and stop them, gathering information is
an extremely urgent matter. Yes. To all of you watching, if you recognize this face,
please contact the Hidden Leaf! I'm counting on you.
Take it to the Hokage. A Shinobi's Resolve


 Enter! A Shinobi bird sent by
the Anbu Black Ops has just arrived. Where is Kakashi? He is probably with Naruto. Regarding that matter, huh...? Tell him to see me when he is done. Have they tracked down
Orochimaru's hideout? No... It says they nearly had him
when they were suddenly attacked. We must select members for
a search team to be sent off immediately. Yes, ma'am. There's likely no traces left of
the Anbu Black Ops who sent this message... "The rule of the Anbu:
When you die, leave no corpse behind." He can't possibly rest in peace
unless we discover that hideout. An order from Lord Orochimaru... From Lord Orochimaru...? That is the order of Lord Orochimaru. Is that so...? From Lord Orochimaru himself!
So he hasn't forgotten about me! When I was sent to take care
of this remote hideout, I was sure I had been forsaken. Did I say something funny, Guren? Humph... All we have to do is
get them to kill each other. The sound of bones being crushed!
Piercing screams! Just the thought of it
gives me a thrill. It's to select members for
Lord Orochimaru's next operation... There's no point if they all die. Yes, I know that! Men! You all heard that, didn't you? If you want to leave this hideout and breathe in the open air, you must win! Then, you will be able to work
for Lord Orochimaru under my command! You are such fortunate men! Now, begin! Fight all you want! Here you go! Miso-flavored pork bone stock
with roast pork... The two thick slices of
roast pork are on me. Thank you! Just what I've been waiting for. Oh... It's hot! Be careful.
Our ramen noodles stay hot till the end. It's just not easy eating
with my left hand. But this kind of makes me happy. Huh? I feel like you and I are
getting closer to Sasuke. Here, lend me those chopsticks. D-Don't tell me, Sakura...
You're going to feed me...? Oh! Say ahh...! This isn't the part for you
to butt in! What...?! Yo... Not "What"! Huh...?! What's going on? Just when Sakura was
about to feed me! When a friend is in trouble,
you must help him. That's what a true friend does
according to this book... Never mind reading books like that.
Just read the situation, will you? How can I read something
that I cannot see? You're such a pain! What's with all this noise? Kakashi Sensei! Naruto can't eat with
his right hand... and we're having a little disagreement
over who's going to feed him. Here, eat! So in the end, it's Kakashi Sensei?! By the way, Kakashi Sensei,
I'm surprised that you haven't landed in the hospital
after a huge mission like that. So is that how people
perceive me nowadays...? What a shock... Well, this time, I didn't need to use
my Mangekyo Sharingan, you see. If you all hadn't arrived in time,
I would have used it again for sure. Sorry... we're late. Then, just as you imagined,
I'd probably be lying in bed now. Naruto...
You have definitely gotten stronger. You're equal to me,
or even stronger... But keep in mind that the greater
the Jutsu you use, the greater the risk to you. Yeah... Kakashi... This new Jutsu...
the Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken. Forbid Naruto from using it again. If he continues using this new Jutsu, Naruto will lose his ability
to mold Chakra. If the cells are disconnected
from the body's Chakra Network, even my medical skills won't cure him. Be certain to emphasize
that to Naruto. Naruto... That new Jutsu of yours... Kakashi Sensei... I know myself best! I'm going to be the Hokage one day,
you know. I'm really powerful,
so there's nothing to worry about! I shouldn't have bothered
worrying about him. I guess these should be the members
of the search team. Isn't Kakashi here yet? He's been notified. He must be having a hard time
with Naruto. I wonder if Kakashi will be able
to talk him into it. We'd better put a guard on him
for a while. He's sure to start training
on that new Jutsu. But if he does that, he'll never be able to build up
his Chakra again... Yes. If that happens, his career
as a Shinobi will be over. Now, I can't ignore that. Yo! It's been a while... Weren't you investigating
the Akatsuki Organization? I stopped by because
I was a little worried. Tell me the details on what
you said just now. Thanks for the ramen, Pops! Give Kakashi Sensei the bill! What?! Thanks...! Thank you. Wait, what...? So, you've finally learned
to do the Shadow Clone... What...? What's going on? Then...let me see how much
you've improved. - Here I come, Big Brother Naruto.
- Here I come, Big Brother Naruto. - Sexy Two-girl Jutsu!
- Sexy Two-girl Jutsu! Whoa...!
So that's your new move?! What do you think, big brother?! The two girls are... Are you all right, Konohamaru?! Hey, Moegi, what are you doing? What are you doing in
front of us ladies...?! This is like déjà vu... You two! This isn't what you always do
when you get together, is it? W-Well, this Jutsu makes
a good diversionary tactic... Besides, you could say this is
a serious competition between the two of us. You two shouldn't be
escalating things like this. You two are the only ones who
would fall for a Jutsu like this! You guys... You seem to be having fun, as usual. Oh! It's the Pervy Sage! Here's another one
that would fall for it... Oh... You're looking better
than I expected, Naruto! Oh, well this is nothing. Idiot! The bones haven't healed yet! You haven't changed at all. Enter. Lord Orochimaru,
it's time for your medicine. Oh, you're back...? Yes. I returned a little while ago. How's Guren? The same... I just don't understand why you make such a fuss
over that woman. You've never liked her, have you? She may not look it,
but at one time, she was my top candidate. Of course, time was not on her side 
and Genyumaru was selected in the end. I am aware of that. When Sasuke achieves
the skills he needs... The time for my reanimation
will be near. When that happens, both the Akatsuki and Leaf Village
will be a hindrance... Our current operation is preparation
for when that happens. Lord Orochimaru, it's because  of
the plans scheduled after your reanimation that I believe there are too many
flaws in that woman's character... This job can be carried out by
no one but Guren. Speed up that test... Yes, sir...
We may be able to leave today. I'm coming in. Tell me... Do you like red camellias?
White camellias? Camellias don't lose their petals;
the whole flower falls off. You can get oil from the nuts, and the tree makes
very good charcoal. Don't come in here...
Go back! Go back? I wonder where
I can go back to? Where should I go back to? Is this where I'm supposed
to return to? But, something's not right. This is not the place where
I'm supposed to return to. That's right...
You wouldn't know that, would you? Say, do you have somewhere
to go back to? Such a place does not exist for me. So here you are, Yuukimaru...
It's time to leave. All right. Sorry to bother you. See you again, Sasuke... So, was Naruto convinced? He has matured. I left the rest up to that man... That is for the best...
There's something I want you to do. Ninja File It's a search mission... It hasn't been confirmed yet, but the Anbu Black Ops have discovered
what could be Orochimaru's hideout. However, the operative
has been killed and the map he sent me only
shows the general area. I see. Do you have a problem with
the members that I have chosen? I'm impressed... You have chosen the best possible
members for this search team. Kakashi Sensei... Is everyone here? I'm sure you've already heard
about our mission. Yes... It is to pinpoint the hideout that's thought to belong
to Orochimaru. Yes... With all of your abilities,
it should not be very difficult to do. First, I'll get a head start and
release my parasitic insects to search out the area where Chakra
is in the highest concentration. Akamaru and I will do the rest!
His nose will pinpoint their hideout. Once we find the hideout, I should search out the enemies' Chakra
using my Byakugan, right? I'm counting on you... If that is really
Orochimaru's hideout, the chances that Sasuke is there...? Yes... Does Naruto know that?! That's a silly question. If he knew that,
he'd never sit still. That's true. Yes. Naruto hasn't been told
about this mission... Tsunade told me about it. You've perfected
the Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken... Well done! It's no good... Huh? What do you mean? You have accomplished a feat not even the Fourth Hokage
was able to. Have more confidence in yourself. If this is the result,
then it's no good. I mastered an Instant Kill Jutsu. But...but...it's pointless if I'm only going to waste my Chakra on top of getting injured! I see... This isn't a Jutsu that can
be used over and over. I have to learn a couple Jutsu
that use less Chakra, but are effective. Is that what you were
worrying about? In that case, all you have to do
is train some more. At your current level, there are sure to be other Jutsu
that you can master. What do you say? Will you come with me on another journey
to gather writing material? I'm asking you if you have the will
to train with me once more. Yeah! Take me with you! All right. Then we'll leave at once! Where are we going? First, we must heal that arm! Shall we visit a hot spring? What do you mean, "hot spring"?! I can see exactly where your thoughts
are headed, you Pervy Sage! But I found a spa with
mixed bathing that's good for healing broken bones... See, that is  your motive, after all! Yes, well that's too bad.
Maybe I'll invite Sakura, then. What?! Yes, yes, I'll go.
Wait for me! Come on, take me with you. I'm injured, you know...
Don't leave me behind, Pervy Sage! To think he'd jump out
all of a sudden... Hinata, how is he? He's already dead...
But his body...? There's no doubt.
Orochimaru's Curse Mark. If this is really the hideout,
what's going on in there? There are multiple traces
of fading Chakra within the cave. Looks like we'll have to go in,
Kakashi Sensei. Be aware of your surroundings
as we move along. Be wary of any traps. Next time:
"Orochimaru's Hideout Discovered"


 - The Fifth...
- Hidden Leaf Super Quiz! Your hosts are,
yours truly, Yamato and... Ino Yamanaka, filling in for the ill Sakura. Before I give you the question, all of you know that every Ninjutsu
has a name, right? Take for example, Choji's Jutsu... It's the Super Expansion Jutsu. Exactly. So here is a question about
a Ninjutsu not named in the series. Now, for the question. What is the Jutsu that Tayuya used to reel in three angry ogres with her flute? Demon Flute:
Phantom Warrior Controlling Music That's correct! Shino! How did you know that?! You want to know? That's because it is written here in
the Book of Secret Accounts on Fighting! For Shino, who got the answer correct, we have a prize of
a 100,000-ryo book certificate. I'm going to buy lots of JUMP COMICS! Ino! Yikes! You lied about
the Super Quiz being cancelled and you stole my role
as assistant! Cha! It seems the preparations
have been completed. Yes, Lord Orochimaru. I will have a new body. As well as what is necessary
for my plans after that... Go, Kabuto! I will be looking forward
to your return. Get ready.
Yuukimaru, it's time to leave. I wonder where I can go back to... This place I'm going...
is it where I'm returning to? Lord Orochimaru says
he is looking forward to your return. Where should I go back to? Is this where I'm supposed
to return to? Lord Orochimaru has
high hopes for you. You must live up to them. They've dwindled to
a nice number. Enough killing. From now on,
you will be working for me! Huh... Let's go, guys! In order to carry out
Lord Orochimaru's plan, it is necessary to draw out
Yuukimaru's power... I must produce results with these tests
before handing him to Guren. I'll use whatever measures
are necessary to do it... You really can't tell until you try it. Huh? Can't tell where to tie my gaiters
unless I wrap it around several times... You're supposed to be able
to tell when you put it on. But you don't know until
you finish wrapping it around. Let's go. It's almost time. Orochimaru's Hideout Discovered


 Young lady,
the dango here is truly wonderful! Of course, with a beautiful lady
like you serving it, there is no way
it can't be delicious! Oh dear, don't call me
beautiful like that. The dango sure is good, but I'll bet you're much tastier,
ain't that right? We're finally here!
Pervy Sage, let's start training! What're you saying? First, we wash off the dirt
from our travels. Healing your arm is also
part of training. The hot spring here is
good for broken bones. Besides... Hot springs...are so much fun. It's research... Research! You haven't changed, Pervy Sage. Weren't you nearly killed
by Grandma Tsunade for peeking into the women's bath? No! The last time I came,
I'm sure it was a mixed bath. Funny... Maybe they separated the bath
because of guys like you? Huh? Just what have you
been learning from your teacher? Why do you think I do these things? 'Cuz you're a pervert. You idiot! The research for
the Make-Out series is a cover. This is actually Ninja training to make oneself go unnoticed
by women who are on guard. Yeah yeah. Ahem...anyway, being here
at these hot springs is really to treat your broken bone. Think of soaking in the bath
as part of training. Pervy Sage, hurry and train me...! Geez... You're such an annoying kid! Huh? No need to worry about this now. I've trained so that instead of...
relying on Nine-Tail's power... rather than use a power
that hurts everyone... I've trained to attain
the power to protect, but it's just not enough! Pervy Sage, isn't there
a long-distance type Jutsu that I can learn? Talking as though
he's a full-fledged Ninja... Orochimaru, huh... Multiple Legs Barrage! I swore to myself that I'd never let Akamaru
go through anything like that again. Akamaru... Kiba, what are you thinking? Well, I was just thinking about
our mission to rescue Sasuke. But this time... if it's really gonna be at
Orochimaru's hideout, maybe the same type of people
will appear... What? Getting nervous? Just the opposite, Kakashi Sensei! In addition to Shikamaru, word has it that
even Naruto beat the Akatsuki. I've been training hard too. I have to show the others
that I won't lose either! Then I'll have to demonstrate
the results of my training too. Huh? That's because unlike you guys, I've rarely been on missions consistently
with the same members. Are you still bitter because you couldn't be a part
of the last mission? That plus the fact that Naruto didn't
even recognize his comrade's face. Of course, Naruto wouldn't
recognize you! Your face is practically
covered in that get-up! That shouldn't matter...
among comrades. C'mon, let's all do our best together. I won't lose either! I've done my best
so that Naruto will acknowledge me. Before I knew it, they've all become
so strong and reliable. Even him. Pervy Sage, do you think I've gotten
a bit stronger at least? What are you saying? You're the same novice
you were three years ago. I see... I guess so... If that's what being wise means, then I don't care if I'm a fool
for the rest of my life. Even without a teacher, I'll create some awesome Jutsu
and rescue Sasuke, no matter what! Tell me...have your feelings changed
since three years ago? I never take back my word.
That's my Ninja Way! Hmm, I guess so. I was concerned about my friend, and what I gained from it was
a sense of helplessness and regret. Yet Naruto has lived with the same regret for three years
without giving up on his friend... He has never forgotten Sasuke
and has continued to train... Earnest in his desire to bring
Sasuke back home to Hidden Leaf Village. Even if his own body is battered... The idiot has matured in his idiot way.
I'll acknowledge that. Just a little bit. Really? But in order to bring him back,
I've gotta get much stronger. Maybe he can... They say, "a place where
someone still thinks of you; that's a place you can call home." Yeah. This is... the Anbu Black Ops who
sent the message... What is it? You sense something? This is more than just a sense,
right, Akamaru? The smell of death. There're quite a few dead bodies
up ahead. My nose is pretty sharp,
but...which way? This way. Proceed with caution. This is...! H-Help... A Curse Mark! This guy has Orochimaru's Curse Mark! Without a doubt,
this is Orochimaru's hideout. However...
What happened here?! Faint traces of Chakra! One...two... There are so many! Let's go, Kakashi Sensei! We have no time to waste. Be wary of traps. Let's go. How terrible... What is this?! Looks like they fought each other. A split in the ranks? We'd better find out from them. What's the matter, Akamaru?! Dammit! We'd have been in big trouble if Akamaru hadn't found
an escape route. Heh heh, Good boy, Akamaru! But to think they laid a trap. I don't think so. I don't think the enemy
knew that we were close. That trap was set to
destroy any evidence; to destroy the hideout itself. But there were survivors...! Yeah... what a cruel thing to do. I can't forgive him,
that Orochimaru! Quit wasting time! We've succeeded in our mission
to locate Orochimaru's hideout, but... We can't say we succeeded. Because we can't return
to the village without any information
about Orochimaru. He's right, Kakashi Sensei! Um... We can still gather information. The enemy set a time device here... In other words, there are people
who left this site. You're right. The enemy who
has information is still close by. Then it's decided!
Let's pursue them. Leave the enemy search to me. This is a specialty of
my Parasitic Insects. Hey! Don't forget
my Akamaru's sharp nose! E-Even I...! Where are we headed? Heh, isn't it Orochimaru's hideout? Do you understand what
that means? S-Stop... Please stop! There's no guarantee
we're safe if he messes around
with our bodies again. That's for sure... B-But I'm scared of Orochimaru...
I can't defy him... Right now, it's only that woman. Y-You're right... If we kill that one woman,
we'll be free! Yeah! Let's kill her! Who said you can take a break? I did! One, two, three... We won't listen to you anymore. We'll kill you and go free!
It's decided! Ten, eleven, twelve... sixteen of you. Are you scared...?!
Well, are you? Fool. You think you can beat
all of us here?! Woman! How pitiful! You're not able to
judge your opponent's strength! Crystal Style! Crystal Prison! My insects have detected the enemy. Geez, they couldn't even figure out if they had a chance to
beat their opponent... They're not only weak; they're stupid. Are you trying to say you're smarter? What will you do? Are you coming? I-I... Of course! We're coming. We didn't run away...
We just wanted to avoid a fight. I can't face Lord Orochimaru
if I don't have any henchmen. I pledge my loyalty. No need to.
If you betray me, you'll just die. A Jutsu that ensnares
the enemy in green crystal? Earth Style? I've never seen anything
like it before... My parasitic insects have been
destroyed in the same way. This couldn't be... Well now, shall we begin training? Yeah! I'm ready! Maybe we'll do a simple Jutsu using
your Wind Chakra this time. A simple Jutsu?! Do you remember the training
we did during our last journey? I remember doing all kinds of things... Remember,
you trained with the toad? Th-That's the one character
I couldn't handle. You remember? I figured it was a bit
too early back then, but you can do it now. It's a Collaboration Ninjutsu with a toad! Combining two Jutsu to transform them
into one stronger Jutsu is known as a Collaboration Jutsu. Hey, I know that! When we beat that Akatsuki fellow, Captain Yamato combined
his Water Style with my Wind Style to form the Hurricane Vortex Jutsu. Good, that makes it easier. Summoning Jutsu! Oh Jira-chan...it's been so long. Mr. Gamariki, sorry to make you
come so far. Oh, don't mention it.
You and I are old friends. Why...Why is Mr. Gamariki here...?! Oh, Naruto. You're here too? Unless the Ninja duo is completely
in sync, a Combination Ninjutsu is impossible. Yamato must have had perfect timing
with his Hurricane Vortex Jutsu. Oh, then it's useless. Not him...there's no way
he can synchronize with me. Shut up! Shut up!
If we can't, then it's your fault! Besides, why do I have to sync up
with Mr. Gamariki?! To perfect a new Jutsu, right? From this moment on, you will train to synch your timing
with Mr. Gamariki's timing. Well, I guess if you insist,
Jiraiya, I have no choice... B-But! Don't you think it'll be
an even greater Combination Ninjutsu if you and I did it, Pervy Sage? I can't be with you all the time. But you can summon the toad. But, you know...
is this Jutsu really strong? Mr. Gamariki... Watch carefully. Be gentle, okay? Wow... I didn't know you were
so strong, Mr. Gamariki. With perfect timing, my Chakra flowed
into Mr. Gamariki's Water Pistol. Your Wind Chakra will go well
with the Water. If you practice, you'll be able to perfect
an even stronger Jutsu. An even stronger Jutsu... All right! I'll do it! Just bring it on! First comes special rhythm training. S-Special rhythm training? - One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two... - One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two... - One, two, one, two...
- One, two, one, two... - One, two, one-!
- One, two, one-! Mr. Gamariki and I... Naruto and I... - aren't compatible!
- aren't compatible! Maybe it's not possible. You called? I thought I'd test you to see
the level of your power. I see... You didn't even flinch. You're very confident taking me
on like that. I'm ready on my side. Anytime... "Loving smack," my butt! I've had enough training
with Mr. Gamariki! Come on! Combination with a toad
is the most important element for the Collaboration Ninjutsu
using Wind Style and Water Style! Even so. What can't be done,
can't be done! It'll be much faster to find someone
who is more compatible with me! Fool! You can't summon anyone
with that arm! Hah! You haven't forgotten how fast
I can heal, have you, Pervy Sage? Next episode: "Encounter."


 Those are cattails. Huh? Grab the tips. This is the lake. Encounter

 It’s true, lake water
isn’t salty at all. It’s different from the ocean. Although…I’ve never seen
the ocean either. Just now… Hmm? Well, around here should do… What’s so funny? I have a feeling something fun
is about to start. Yeah, we’re going to
have some fun. Can you put this on? This is a special medicine,
which will draw out your power… no, make something
interesting happen. It’s coming… That’s the limit. It’s there…no doubt about it.
In this lake… And…this child… we can use him. Lord Orochimaru… What is it, Kakashi? Take this to the village. Have the Fifth Hokage analyze it. What is this…? One of Shino’s parasitic insects
which fell victim to a Jutsu… It was an enemy believed to be
a follower of Orochimaru. Orochimaru?! According to the footprints, there are five or six more
that we must pursue. Move quickly. Leave it to me! I’m counting on you. All right, we’re going to
pursue the enemy. Increase the range…
spread out and search. Don’t miss a single trace of them! Right! Yeah. I, Rinji, will take care of things in
your absence, so don’t worry. I’m counting on you. I guess she still
can’t trust us. She doesn’t want us to learn
about Orochimaru’s hideout, so we’re shoved into
a place like this… She’s extremely cautious. It’s why she rarely
makes mistakes. So conversely, we can trust her. The ones who were killed
were trying to run away because they didn’t want
to see Orochimaru. Can you really trust her? One, two… One, two… One, two… One, two… You’re working hard, Naruto. Mr. Gamariki’s sternness will temper you
like steel and nurture you… – Awesome!
– An outdoor bath! And before long, your body
will be tough enough… to repel any temptation
of the world--! Can’t repel…
any temptation of the world… Goodness! Can you even do
something this simple?! What’re you saying?!
It’s the way you teach that’s bad! Oh? You’re blaming me?
You think you’re better than me? Humph! Forget it!
I can’t take this anymore! Hey! Stop right there!
Love Smack! Damn it!
Coming at me from behind… That’s cowardly! – Take this! And that!
– Stop! What is this?! The water’s all gone. Let’s go. No! You call this training?!
Slobbering around like that--?! This is the Love Smack! Forget your Love Smack!
This duo is disbanded! Fine with me! That’s enough! Both of you! As if Naruto isn’t enough…
But you too, Mr. Gamariki… Well, you know Jira-chan,
it’s not like I don’t understand. I do, but… For a Collaboration Ninjutsu using
the Wind Style and Water Style, nothing is more important
than synchronizing with the toad. All the more reason why… our bodies must be compatible,
or it’s useless for me. Yeah well, we aren’t compatible, so it’ll be faster if
we find someone who is. Hmm… That may be a good idea. However…you can’t summon
with that arm, can you? Hah! You haven’t forgotten
how fast I recover, have you? Pervy Sage! Summoning Jutsu! H-Huh?! Long time no see… Hello, Naruto! Huh?! Gamakichi and Tatsu…? Oh, you’ve grown! You guys’ve gotten pretty big. Of course we have! It’s because of all the snacks
we’ve eaten. Anyway, why’d you summon us? Oh yeah, I have some
important business! I want to refine our compatibility. What?! Does that taste good? Lord Orochimaru! That’s… You’re late. Lord Orochimaru has
chosen Genyumaru. And that was Sasuke Uchiha
just now… Lord Orochimaru’s next vessel… Sasuke, let me see the results
of your training thus far. You’re my opponent? By no means. How impressive. A thousand foes stand before you
and you don’t even bat an eyelid. That man…how strong is he…? Begin. Sasuke… You are truly… What the--! That guy’s …overwhelming… Well, if that’s the case,
we’ll train you really hard. Yeah, you do that! All right! Start the music! ? I can hear…the frog song. ? I can hear…the frog song. Huh?! Huh?! What’s going on here? ? I see a yummy-looking fly. Here I go! Come on, Naruto. Keep up with Gamatatsu,
connect with his soul. Cripes! Just what part of
this is supposed to be training?! You just don’t get it,
do you, Naruto…? Is that it? You didn’t kill all of them…
How naïve. There are others I’d rather kill. Unless you become heartless,
you will not defeat Itachi. When I stand before him, I’ll be heartless,
whether I want to be or not. Not even a tiny spurt of blood… When I watch this boy… I look back to the time
I was called a genius… and think how ridiculous that was. Very soon… so very soon,
he will be mine…! It’s been a long time, Guren. I’m glad you came. Yes, he is my next vessel… You haven’t given up yet,
have you… on being my vessel? Your abilities…are quite appealing. When I first met you,
I was very shocked. Lord Orochimaru… You’re wrong… The power you have…
I’m interested. Come with me. Back then… I was the one who was enchanted
by your power… Your strength… To become like you…was my wish. There’s only one reason
why you were summoned… I need you to do something for me. Of course. That is the reason
why I serve you, Lord Orochimaru.. I really want you
for this mission. In fact… you’re the only one
who can do it. Only me? Then perhaps,
I may want to reconsider. Who…is the best suited to
become my vessel. He’s quite fatigued…
Perhaps we should rest a bit. Dammit! How am I supposed to
keep up with that ridiculous movement?! I guess trying to connect
heart-to-heart is crazy… especially with the toads. Can you…connect hearts? Wh-Who the hell are you?! Where’d you come from…? What does it mean to
connect heart-to-heart? Huh?! W-Well… My feelings are understood
by someone else… and that person’s feelings
reach me as well. Then it happens? Y-Yeah, well sure. I mean, if you really focus
on it hard… Then one day…
one day, it’s sure to connect. And even Sasuke… Then that person you’re thinking
about will know where home is. Oh… You wouldn’t know
what I mean, would you… if I start rambling on like that? So if someone is thinking
about me, then that’s the place I go back to? Yeah… that’s home. I learned something good. Yeah, right? By the way, what’s your name– Huh? Hey? That kid…where’d he disappear to? Kakashi Sensei! Is it okay to be
relaxing in a place like this? Leave the search to my parasitic insects
and rest your bodies. He’s right, Kiba. Yeah… We haven’t found the enemy yet. It’s dangerous to act recklessly. Besides, that Crystal Jutsu… Until Pakkun returns,
we must act with caution. Enter! Lady Tsunade… Kakashi sent a messenger. Well well, it’s Pakkun. Before I give you Kakashi’s message,
give me a drink of water. Ahh… What a nice bath. Huh?! Gamakichi?!
What’s with that body? What’re you saying? I’d be in everyone’s way at the baths
with such a huge body. So I used Ninjutsu to
make myself smaller. Hey, that’s an interesting Jutsu
you have. Brother, hot springs are so nice. Washes away all the fatigue
of training. What training?!
You were chasing flies all day. What’re you saying? That’s the foundation of
our collaboration training. Training? Who could copy
that wacky stuff? Who said anything about copying? This training is about feeling
what’s in Gamatatsu’s heart and responding to it. Huh? Gamatatsu…? This bath feels so good… Never mind about the timing
or matching his movements. Feeling what’s in his heart
and responding to it, that’s the essence of collaboration. At that point, for the first time,
you’ll be in synch. Your partner’s heart…feeling it. I see… Yeah, I get it. Let me, let me try it once more! Combination Jutsu training! This time, I’ll show you I can do it! Yay! Training, training! Huh?! What happened?!
The water’s all gone again! Hey Gamatatsu, shape up! I have a bellyache. The sexy voices of lots of women… Oh, they all left just now. No! Naruto! You’ve got a long way to go if you’re getting distracted
by what you can see. – I’m hungry…
– I know already! Hey! Found a grasshopper! Then open yourself up a bit more and concentrate on
Gamatatsu’s moves, will ya?! – Munch time!
– That's what I'm doing! Hey, there’s a big caterpillar… You need to concentrate more
to feel the emotional vibe from Gamatatsu, and express it through
your own style. Will you shut up for a second?! I think I’m about to
get something here! Next Time: “Connecting Hearts”

  Frog...I'm a frog... Connecting Hearts

I can hear...the frog song. Gamatatsu's...mind... I can hear...the frog song. Read his mind...
and respond to it... - I can hear...
- the frog song. - Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin.
- I can hear... Chinchiro chinchiro... - ...chinchirorin.
- I can hear... -  ...the frog song.
- I can hear...the frog song. - Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin.
- I can hear...the frog song. Naruto, you don't look like you've
opened up your mind yet! Don't get swept up by
Gamatatsu's movements! Communicate with Gamatatsu's mind, arrange things your way,
then just express yourself! Yeah! Huh? Sorry... - Look Gamakichi is singing.
- Look Gamakichi is singing. - Gero gero gero gero gero...
- Gero gero gero gero gero... - Look Gamatatsu is singing too.
- Look Gamatatsu is singing too. - Kero kero kero kero kero...
- Kero kero kero kero kero... Gamatatsu's...mind... Ah, that cloud...
looks like a cream puff... It looks yummy! They've finally reached
each other's mind... Oh? Did you feel something
just now, Gamatatsu? Why are you asking me this? A butterfly! What?! - Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Rock, paper, scissors, go! - Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Rock, paper, scissors, go! - Go!
- Go! - Go!
- Go! - Go!
- Go! - Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! - What's your name?
- Gamatatsu! This doesn't mean
you're on the same wavelength. - ? I can hear...the frog song.
- ? I can hear...the frog song. - ? Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin
- ? Chinchiro chinchiro chinchirorin I can't move anymore... Here! Eat it! Thanks. I think we all have to
acknowledge you. What? Gamatatsu, Gamakichi,
Sakura, Tsunade...and I... We all admit you've worked
really hard. I wonder what's pushing you forward. Well, I never give up and I have guts! Sasuke... Hmm? I wonder if Sasuke will... acknowledge that about me...? I hope he does... What...? I can't tell him about the Akatsuki... Hey, all of you! I have something to do,
so I must leave. Can you go back to the village and help with the rest
of Naruto's training? We'll take care of it! I'll do it if you give me
some snacks. All right, all right.
I'm counting on you! Good luck, Naruto! Work hard and truly become...
the Hokage... Naruto, good luck with
your never-say-die spirit... A new enemy? Right. The enemy seems
really hard to beat. I saw that the team
was really flustered. Therefore, you're giving this to me? There's something inside the crystal. It's Shino's Parasitic Insect that was
overcome by the enemy's Jutsu. Kakashi requested an
analysis right away. This can't be... I've only heard about it
through rumors... Shizune, take this to the forensics team. It's urgent! All right! What?! The Pervy Sage disappeared?! Yeah, he asked me
to give this to you. Give it to me! Please take care of snacks
for Gamatatsu. We're going back to our village.
Pack up! What's wrong? Look... I can see the valley
where we stayed until now. Lord Orochimaru is waiting.
Let's go. Oh, okay! Do you smell something, Akamaru? Did you find anything, Kiba? No, we haven't picked up
any scents. I used Byakugan,
but couldn't see anything. Oh! A bat? There are some signs. Huh? Where?! I'm talking about my insects.
So don't get so excited. Your insects?
Don't get me excited like that. Well, you had tens of thousands
of insects, so I wouldn't be surprised
if one of them is still alive. But that one insect
out of tens of thousands that managed to survive
becomes an asset to us.. An asset to us? Because it has survived despite
incurring the enemy's Jutsu. You mean the insects are
now immune to the enemy's Jutsu... My insects' life span is only
a few hours at most. And the immune insect can breed
in a very short period. That's amazing! But it's just a possibility.
I'm not sure if it'll be successful. Anyway, I must find as many
surviving insects as possible. We'll help you. Yeah! Count on us! There's no need. What?! Only I can search for
the insects. I can't have you stepping on them
while you're searching around blindly. Can't you refuse our help
with a little more finesse? I don't want to waste time
by being vague. That's fine. Shino, you go find the insects
that survived. And we'll continue our search. All right, let's go, Akamaru! Sorry, but I've had a series
of snake eyes. Hey Bro, I hope you're not cheating. No way! I was born lucky,
and I'm totally different from you. No wonder I'm losing. Since your luck is so strong, let me roll the dice
that you just used! She's late. Shoot! Almost!
Just one more roll! Wanna try?
It's a good way to kill time. You're ignoring me? Fine. Fine. But I'm a little surprised... That you're waiting for Guren
to come back. You seemed defiant to me, so I thought you'd take advantage
of this chance to escape. Even if I could escape,
I couldn't beat her. That's a surprising answer. I didn't know you had decided
to obey Guren. How about you guys? Us? You knew from the beginning... that a fight for survival
would occur in that hideout. I thought you had already
joined forces with them. You're sharp! That's right! But it's not surprising. It's better to have people who help
each other in dangerous situations. So when times get desperate,
we promise to help each other. Those who overestimated
their own abilities and acted thoughtlessly have died. So I say, our wisdom has
helped us to survive. Though, at the rate we were going
in that battle royal, we might've fought each other. It's true that you were really strong
out there all by yourself. While we were fighting individually,
we had to keep away from you... But we are four here. We won't be beaten
if we stay together, not even by you. Now we all work for Guren... You'd better socialize with the others. Man, why couldn't they find
a better hideout? Guren isn't nice to us.
She left us in this old shack. I'm going on patrol. Did you find something? What's wrong, Akamaru?! Deliver this information quickly. I thought you were out
on patrol. I had something to think about.
I'm just setting out. I'll go with you. Does that mean...
you're heeding my advice? A dog whistle? Right. Akamaru said
he definitely heard it. Do you think the enemy
has a dog? I doubt it, because it's more difficult to remove
dog odors than human odors. And if they have a dog, Akamaru and I would've
caught its scent long ago. Then...why the dog whistle? I don't know. Do you know which direction
it came from? No, but I'm sure they're not far away. We've finally arrived... First of all, I'm going to have ramen
at Ichiraku to refresh myself! Then let's resume my training! Brother Naruto! Huh? I guess you created a naughty technique
at the hot springs during training, right? So, I'll do the new version
of Sexy Jutsu! Whoa! Hey, Konohamaru! Ouch! So buying me one bowl
of ramen is your way of apologizing for hitting me that hard? It's because you used
that technique thoughtlessly, without caring about the time or place! Summoning Jutsu! Oh! This is Brother Naruto's Summoning! I can call for bigger guys,
but these brats are enough for today. You called us brats? Have you forgotten you're
our dad's henchman? Come on, please let me play cool
in front of him today. Then let's start training again! Brother, I wonder what
today's snack is. Uh-oh... I'm looking forward to it. That's right. I completely forgot
about the snacks. Well, we'll have snacks
after our training. What?! You don't have
any snacks for us? Brother, I'm going home. Okay, okay! Snack! Snack! Konohamaru,
can you buy some snacks? Got it! Yahoo! Snack! Snack! I'll never have any money
if I keep doing this. Oh?! Did you finish all
your snacks already? Oh! He's very skillful! How disgusting! Listen, Gamatatsu! If you help me train really well, Pervy Sage will give you more snacks
than you can possibly eat. So let's work hard! Yahoo! So? Last time, we worked on how
to find the right timing. So today,
let's start where we left off. What's that? When you spit out the water, I find the right timing,
and I pour in my Chakra! There! I'll find the perfect timing,
so you just shoot your water pistol. Water pistol... What's a water pistol? Blast water out from your mouth
using Water Style Jutsu... Water Style? What?! Brother, I can't do
that kind of thing. What are you talking about?! You're a frog, so it's easy
for you to do Water Style. He's right.
He can't do Water Style Jutsu. You must be kidding! Why have we trained together
up until now?! Even if you yell at him, he can't do
something he doesn't know! Then, Gamakichi, you do it. Why? Can't you help us out? N-No, I can't... Why not? Come here for a bit. - What...?
- Come here. What did you say? Say what? Because... Huh? I can't hear you. Because it's Water Style Jutsu... You're irritating me.
Just speak clearly! I don't have skill for
Water Style Jutsu! What?! How did it go? Find anything? No, nothing. I didn't find anything either. The weather is making it hard
to track by scent. Well, it's understandable
in this pouring rain... Look, even the bats are
taking cover from the rain-- Wait! What's wrong, Kiba? So that's the mystery behind
that dog whistle! Kakashi Sensei, if that's the case, our movements may be detected
by the enemy. Next Time:
A Night of Rain."
  
  
 Why don't you like Mr. Gamariki? We haven't gotten along
from the first time we met. Mr. Gamariki is a teacher
of Collaboration Jutsu. Nice to meet you...Naruto. What's the big idea?! All right, let's begin training! One heart, one body! Use your hips! Terrible! I'll punish you! Cripes! This is ridiculous! There's no way I can endure this! Are you giving up? It's not about being weak
or whatever! Quiet! You must not take
the Collaboration Jutsu lightly! Then get serious and train me properly! Don't talk back! - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
- Training! Training! Training! You're not ready for
this training yet. I can't put up with this anymore! He's a really nice guy... ~Brought to you by Crunchyroll.com~! And...? Yes, there should be no problem
with Yuukimaru's strength. All that remains is
to modify the drug. When will that be completed? It won't take very long. Then order Guren and Yuukimaru
to set out ahead. I know I've asked before,
but are you sure about that woman? We have no choice. This is something
only Guren can do. This strategy will bear fruit once Guren and Yuukimaru's powers
become one. How long are you going
to make me wait? No more waiting. Lord Orochimaru has given his order. Really?! So naïve. Yuukimaru! Are we returning somewhere?
Will that be my home? Who is this kid? You're taking him.
This boy. You expect me to babysit? Already complaining? Were you lying about being loyal
to Lord Orochimaru? Although, with that attitude,
no child will take to you. Don't act smug just because
you're Lord Orochimaru's aide. I can kill you anytime. I see. She's able to instantly
crystallize anything that's nearby. Although she looks unarmed,
everything around her is a weapon. So that is the Crystal Style. No wonder she caught
Lord Orochimaru's eye. If I die, your reincarnation
won't go well. You want to become one
with Lord Orochimaru, don't you? So pretty! What're you saying? Isn't it going to rain more? Humph, what a weird kid. You make a nice pair. Whoa. I'll catch up right away.
So go on ahead with Yuukimaru. All right. But if he gets wise with me,
I'll let 'im have it. Be careful. Someone's approaching
from over that way. What?! How would you know that? I didn't tell you, did I? On the way to your hideout,
I took care of an Anbu Black Ops from the Hidden Leaf Village
who was checking out the area The Leaf Village is sure
to be on the move. You don't want to get involved
with them. Make sure you give them the slip. I'll be the judge of that. Remember, if you fail
in this mission with Yuukimaru, all discussion of
your reincarnation ends. A Night of Rain

 The Hidden Leaf... Those guys! They'd better not betray me
and run to the Hidden Leaf! Am I going home? I hope I can return home... But is there a place I can return to? A place where someone thinks of you,
that's where home is. I'm sure there is. Look over here.
These are dog tracks. A dog... That was a bad move. They've become so weak,
I can't feel their response. Found one! All right! It's got eggs. If I can make them hatch... I don't get it! Why can't the son of
the Chief Toad use Water Style?! The Chief Toad! Liquid Bullets! He uses Water Style amazingly! Well, if I can't do it,
I can't do it. So quit harping about that! - What?!
- Don't say, "what"! Oh come on, Brother Naruto. You'll just have to make do with
Mr. Gamatatsu's way of training. Boy, now there's a kid
who understands. I don't have that kind of time! Well, if you're not interested,
then I'll quit training you! Ask Mr. Gamariki to help you. Oh no...! Got it... I'll train with Gamatatsu,
after all. Okay. As long as you understand. So how do you start
Water Style Jutsu? Well, frankly, I'm not sure... I see! It's Water Style, so we should start
by drinking water. I see... Oh! Yes, I see! Is it true the enemy
is prowling around? I'm sure of it.
They're hiding in this mountain. Just who are they? I don't know. But if they're searching for
Orochimaru's hideout... Either the Akatsuki...
or the Hidden Leaf. What'll we do? Should we attack? Without Guren, there's no guarantee
that we can pull it off. I was wrong... About what? I figured this was your chance...
to make a run for it. A run for it? Your chance to run over
to the Hidden Leaf's side with information
about Orochimaru as a gift. I see. Well, I never gave it
a thought... I get it. You wanna turn yourself in
to the Hidden Leaf? Not at all. Then what's your reason
for sticking with Guren? It's personal. Hmm...? Cripes... If I were alone, I would have
already reached my destination. I don't want to go there anymore. I get headaches...
No, I want to go back. But I don't have a place to return to. Oh...but that person said... If someone is thinking about me...
that's the place to go home to. But how do I go about getting
someone to think about me? Can't you quit babbling
and start walking faster? Cripes! Just what's with this kid? A red camellia or a white one.
Which do you prefer? A camellia... Camellia? That... Oh. Yes, this is a camellia, all right. Do you like camellias? Camellias... I don't like camellias. This is just coincidence. Hey! What's the matter?! Damn! Damn! There's no way we can go back
to the hideout in this rain. I-It's cold. What? You're cold? A fever...! You summoned me? Yamato, I want you to go
and assist Team Kakashi. Kakashi Senpai? I heard it was just a scouting mission. Has something happened? The problem is that
they had a run-in with the enemy. This foe uses a Jutsu
we've never seen before. A Jutsu we've never seen before? We don't understand everything
about it yet. I'm having the sample Kakashi sent
analyzed right away. Who shall I take? Sai who can search from the sky,
and Sakura in case anyone is injured. But Sakura has gone on
an errand for me. She's to return at dawn. Set out as soon as
Sakura comes back. Understood. But if this involves Orochimaru,
won't Naruto want to go too? Now listen! Naruto is not
to find about about this. How did it go? Find anything? No, nothing... I came up with nothing too. Especially when it rains, these conditions make it impossible
to catch any scents. So...no progress at all. Huh?! Even the bats are inside... Huh? Bats?! I'll go out and search once more. No wait! Don't move. What's the matter, Kiba? Well, I've been thinking about it
this whole time... About that mysterious
dog whistle. The mysterious dog whistle? Yeah... There's an animal that uses
ultrasonic waves with the same frequency
as a dog whistle... These guys here. I see. You're saying the enemy
is manipulating a bat? But which bat? Well, I don't know that. The more we move in the shadows, the greater the chance
of our being detected. In fact, they may already
have spotted us. Once the crystal sample
we sent to the village is analyzed, we'll know what steps
can be taken next. Right now, we have to place
our hopes on Shino's insects. I have to deliver good news
to Lord Orochimaru...! I can't have you die right now! You got that? Don't die! She's late!
When's she coming back? Yeah, she should have returned by now. I should've brought Rinji and Gozu. Be careful. Someone's approaching
from over that way. I can't waste time
 in a place like this... Are you all right? So warm. Damn! What are you doing? Guren... Are you feeling better? I can't have you disappearing
like that. Lord Orochimaru entrusted you to me. What's that? My mom... By the way, where's...your family? My mother...didn't return... So...I don't have anywhere to go. Camellias... You like them, right? This camellia will never wither. As long as I'm alive. Let's go. Is this the newly hatched insect
you were talking about? With this insect, we can go up against
that Crystal Style Jutsu, right? There's a good chance
it has a high resistance level, however... There's not enough to use
in actual combat... Damn! And I thought we had
counter measures to fight them... No, it's too early to give up. - Huh?
- You have a plan? Yes, give me some time. Next time:
"The Two Charms"

 Good boy, Akamaru! Gee Akamaru,
you sure have grown... Think so? You haven't noticed
how big he's gotten? Not at all? Hmm, well... I guess now
that you mention it... How does it feel?
Got any place that itches, Akamaru? I guess, he started to need
more shampoo.  And... Well? Feels good, huh, Akamaru? When I brushed him,
more fur was left on the brush... And... All right, come along, Akamaru!
We're going for a walk! Once when I put Akamaru on my head,
I suddenly lost consciousness. But that was pretty minor. Are you kidding?! I mean, he's still white and fluffy
and his nose is black. Right? So how am I supposed
to notice, right? Akamaru? Oh well... whatever... ~Thanks for watching on Crunchyroll.com~ Ohh! Brother, I can't drink anymore! You're doing well. Hang in there and
keep yourself together! That's amazing! Now! Spit! Listen! Mold Chakra in your stomach
and inhale through your nose! Hold it in your chest for a moment...
then exhale it all at once. - All at once!
- All at once! Mold Chakra in your stomach... Then inhale through your nose... Hold it in your chest,
then exhale all at once! At this rate,
things are going to take a while. Well... I guess I'll have to
pull out the big guns. Hold it in your chest for a moment,
and then exhale all at once... I'll show you how to
exhale all at once! Look! Ohh! I-I did it... Brother, I was able to do it! Yay! I did it! I did it! Great job, Gamatatsu! He did it! The Two Charms  


 What's that? If they hadn't betrayed me, there would be someone
holding down the fort. Oh... Hey... Where are you returning to?
Is there anybody waiting for you? Hey, let's go, Yuukimaru! Oh... Hey... If there was a place where
someone was thinking about you, that would be home, right? Huh? Since he's the only one
who got cut from the mission, sooner or later
he'll come over to complain... This is about Naruto, right? Yes... We had no choice. Yamato and the others will be
the best reinforcements for Kakashi and the other members. But Orochimaru is involved
in this mission... Knowing him,
I'm afraid that he'll push things too far. Gama? Milk is the best after training! Oh? Thank you, come again. Sai! Naruto... What are you doing here? I just ran out of Ninja Tool Ink... This store's ink works really well
for molding my Chakra. I see... Oh? But if you need a refill of ink,
that means... Did you get a new mission? Today's mission is supposed
to be a secret. I think that when a person tells a lie,
they avert their eyes... Then I'll do the opposite... What? I didn't get a new mission. So continue your training
without worrying. O-Oh... But why are you telling me
that all of a sudden?! By any chance...
Are you hiding something from me? Well... Not really... Really?! Are you sure? N-Nothing like that... PRACTICAL USE OF A LIE


"Practical use of a lie"? Damn! It looks like the rain
washed away the scent. Don't be so pessimistic!
They're using bats to observe us. We know that their base is around here, or they were forced to stay here
for some reason. You mean, there's a possibility
we'll have to face them? Yes... Oh, you're back... Oh! You were able to find it! We're really lucky. I found a female insect that
survived with her eggs. And they just hatched.
It's the next-generation of insects. This insect is resistant to that  Jutsu? There's a good possibility that
it has a high tolerance. However... The problem is, how many... Right. I thought you had some
great countermeasure against them. Kakashi Sensei, we need more time. What are you going to do? I'm going to increase the number
of these insects...all at once. All right. We need to have a countermeasure
as soon as possible. Get on it right away. All right. Well... What about us? The enemy already knows about us. They could take action
at any moment. It's possible they'd leave to avoid wasting time contacting us
or provoking a fight... In either case, our mission is to capture the enemy
and obtain information. If we lose track of the enemy, they may pose a
threat to the Hidden Leaf later. We'll keep searching for the enemy. Right. It is time to leave. Shino, try to catch up with me
very soon, okay? Of course. Good luck, Shino! Secret Jutsu: Insect Cocoon. I'm back. Guren! I am surprised ragtag people
like you guys didn't betray me... You know us better than that. We decided to follow you
when we left the hideout. Hey, which do you like better,
a red camellia or a white camellia? Who is he? He's Yuukimaru, the one Lord Orochimaru asked us
to take good care of. Lord Orochimaru said that? Listen, guys! Lord Orochimaru gave us
an important mission. That is, we're responsible for
delivering him safely to the lake. We can't afford to fail! But...I know some strangers
are following us from the hideout. That's just what
I'd expect from you, Guren. You're already aware of them. We've done some investigating too. Tell me! Right. The enemy has four people
and one Ninja Hound. Gozu and I identified
Ninja Hound paw prints. Currently three people and one dog
are a couple of kilometers away, and they're slowly heading towards us. What?! What's wrong with Kihou's Jutsu? I'm sure Kihou's Jutsu made
the Ninja Hound's nose ineffective. Because of that, the Hidden Leaf Village sent guys with
high-level tracking skills after the enemy. As we expected,
the Hidden Leaf Village is our enemy... What should we do? I know just the thing. I don't want them to
follow us anymore. Find them! I'll defeat them here! What's going on here?! I heard about the mission, Grandma! Really? Please! Let me join this mission! Naruto, we didn't tell you
because we were worried about you. But...! I understand how you feel, but even if
you manage to find Sasuke, you're not skilled enough
to bring him back. Besides, if you use that new Jutsu... I won't use that Jutsu...
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken. I know more about
my body than anyone. - Then...
- Naruto! Can you tell me
why you applied for this mission? Because... I know I'm not strong enough
to bring back Sasuke... But when Pervy Sage said something,
I thought... The place where someone
still thinks of you, that's called home... I believe that
if you think about someone, you'll reach them... I want to tell him... that this is the place...
where he can return. Do whatever you want. Yes! That's the spirit! An outline of the mission is... Is this all right with you,
Lady Tsunade? That Jiraiya...
he knew this would happen. Sorry, Tsunade! Naruto is still in training,
but I received some urgent information. I'll keep track
of the information. I'm counting on you. But...Naruto is still an idiot. But he has a power
to change people. Someday, he'll change
into something bigger. Tsunade, a person grows up
when he's able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things
that a person must learn on his own. Don't worry,
he got his guts from me... So I hope you'll trust him
when the time comes... Lord Jiraiya... In this mission... Yamato and Kakashi are
also team members. And...he's not just a kid anymore... I really need to use
that Jutsu for this mission! A place to return to... Did you find anything? No. I didn't find anything. Me neither. Well... What should we do now? We can't lose track of our enemy. There's no guarantee we'll find them
after we lose track of them. Since they know about us, the chances of
a confrontation increase dramatically. But it's better not to fight at this point. That's why we had better
find them first. Kiba, can you sniff out the bats' scent? What? Say, just now...! I have something to take care of.
You stay here and wait for me. I'll come back here when I'm done. Don't run around... Lord Orochimaru asked me
to take care of you... Stay here and wait for me...
I'll come back to pick you up. But... my mother never returned. Huh? I wanted to see a red camellia... But that was not the right one... That was a white camellia, in fact. Everyone has left. Is he talking about his hometown? Here... You... This is...! I have this, so... You know... This one is for you, Guren. You want to exchange it, right? All right. You want to master
a new Jutsu right now? That's impossible! I don't care! I have to do it! It's crazy.
Let's go home, Gamatatsu. Hey, wait! Please! I really have
to join this mission. And I need this Jutsu for it.
I really need your help! Good grief... He's serious. But you'll owe us. Right! That's the son of The Chief Toad! Um... Now I'm not sure how...
in such a short period... We can work it out! My Wind Chakra and Gamatatsu's water. That's all we need! Right. What we have to do
is just collaborate on our Jutsu, but... All right. These will be somewhat
harsh measures, but let's try. Oh! Do you have any ideas? You get into Gamatatsu's mouth. Huh?! - What?!
- What?! W-Wait! Why do I have to go
into his mouth?! I don't want to have something
bad tasting in my mouth. Say that again?! It doesn't matter.
We have to do it to master the Jutsu. Besides, you didn't work for
your snacks the other day. Where's your sense
of honor and obligation? Oh...honor and obligation? Then I guess I have to do it. But why in his mouth?! No time to explain! It's really unpleasant... Are you ready? What kind of training is this?! You two have to collaborate on
your Jutsu under these conditions. These conditions?! Right. It'll force you
to be aware of each other. It's like... "you can't master Collaboration Ninjutsu
unless you get into Gamatatsu's mouth." I wonder if he's making this up? And I don't think Gamatatsu
has a Jutsu... Hey! The time goes by quickly
when you're complaining! I know! Concentrate! Kakashi Sensei, I smelled something
at our two o'clock. All right. We'll take a detour. All right. But I never thought we'd have
to slip past the bats' formation... There's a limit on how far away
a bat can sense something. There're many things to
shield us in the woods, so if we keep a certain distance,
it won't be easy for them to find us. I see... But we can't get completely out
of their search area... It's bad luck to say that.
You think I'll die? Now, Naruto has found out... I'm sorry... That's all right.
I didn't think we'd be able to hide it. I was surprised that he negotiated
with the Hokage personally... But Lady Tsunade is not
a person who gives in to pressure. She made a final decision to
allow him to join the mission. So don't worry. Right. And with everyone on board,
it'll be easier to communicate. Still... Naruto is late. I wonder what he's doing? Here we go! You two need to communicate better! Are you all right? I don't think my body
will make it if I keep this up. But you're improving a lot. Really? It seems this is
the right way to do it! Let's keep going! All right!
Keep practicing, Gamatatsu! Yeah! Oh, yeah... I have no doubt. There're a couple of scents ahead... Okay, Hinata. Yes! Byakugan! I caught it! This is...Shinobi Chakra! They must be the guys
who were in that hideout. We're against three people.
What should we do, Kiba? We've got to defeat one of them first
to reduce their numbers! And after that? It would be good if we could
defeat them by ourselves, but we should extend the battle
until Kakashi Sensei comes. Roger. We will attack
one of the two head-on. All right, let's go, Akamaru! Next time:  
"The Unseeing Enemy"  


 Ninja Champion Eating Contest! And here are today's contestants. Let's do this! - How you doing?
- Yeah! Today, the challenge is...
pork roast ramen from Ichiraku! The time limit is 30 minutes.
Let's...start! Naruto's off to an awesome start! - Next!
- Kiba is following him! Me too! Other participants are
keeping their own pace. 10 minutes past! 20 minutes past! I-I can't eat anymore! There's one minute to go! I-I'm so full... Th-This should make me the winner... - I'm done.
- What?! Wow! Yamato completed 31 bowls! Piece of cake! GAME OVER
Time is up! Damn it! I lost! - Nice try, though.
- And the winner is... Hinata! - What?!
- What?! Thank you for the meal. Wh-Who would've thought... Talk about unexpected... You want to master
a new Jutsu right now? That's impossible! I don't care! I have to do it! All right. These will be somewhat
harsh measures, but let's try. Ohh! Do you have any ideas? You...get into Gamatatsu's mouth. Huh?! What about us? The enemy already knows about us. They could take action at any moment. It's possible they'd leave to avoid wasting time contacting us
or provoking a fight... In either case, our mission is to capture
the enemy and obtain information. If we lose track of the enemy, they may pose a threat
to the Hidden Leaf later. We'll keep searching for the enemy. Right. Listen, guys! Lord Orochimaru gave us
an important mission. That is, we're responsible for
delivering him safely to the lake. We can't afford to fail! But...I know some strangers
are following us from the hideout. That's just what I'd expect
from you, Guren. You're already aware of them. Currently three people and one dog
are a couple of kilometers away, and they're slowly heading towards us. What should we do? I know just the thing. I don't want them to
follow us anymore. Find them! I'll defeat them here! The Unseeing Enemy


 All right! I kind of feel like
I can do it! That's the spirit, Naruto. All right! Gamatatsu, one more time. All right... I feel it... Gamatatsu's Chakra! When he stores it up and spits it out... Naruto, are you all right?! I think I just got some sort of clue! I see! Things have gotten interesting... All right! I've got to practice while
the sensation's still fresh... Naruto! - Huh?
- Huh? Oh! Sakura! Come on! Don't waste your time here! You smell terrible. Anyway, why are you so sticky
and worn out?! Well, umm, this is... This is really  important... Anyway, everyone's tired
of waiting for you! Let's go! W-Wait a second, Sakura! I need to practice right now--! No excuses! Gamakichi, Gamatatsu... I'll call you again...! Huh? Sure. Work hard. Big Brother, can I clean out my mouth? I sense him!
This is a Ninja's Chakra. Look out! So you're their leader! Kakashi Sensei! Sensei! Don't, Kiba! What?! I missed. But since Gozu is taking care
of their boss, it looks like things will be easy. You've got quite the tracking ability...
It really is unfortunate. Could it be... Is it them? Yeah. Probably... They were in that hideout. Be careful, okay? Okay, we're against three people. What should we do, Kiba? Akamaru and my Jutsu are linked. We've got to defeat one of them first
and reduce their numbers. And after that? It would be good if we could
defeat them by ourselves, but it'll be best if we can prolong
the battle until Kakashi Sensei comes. Okay. We need to go after one
of the two in front... But from what I can see,
we should avoid that masked guy. He looks like he's hiding something. Which means... Let's go, Akamaru! Fang Over Fang! Kigiri, smoke screen! Kiba! Crap! Poison Mist?! I see. Thank you, Akamaru! But does the fact that
it's not poisonous... mean that it's just a diversion? What--?! What's this?! The smells around me...disappeared...? I see. They use this to erase traces
of their movements... This is bad... Aside from the fact that I can't see,
I can't smell anything either... Wait. It should be the same
for our enemies as well. So how do they know exactly
where I am?! Go, Nurari! They're going to get me! Duck! Hinata?! Stand back, Kiba! I'll handle this... Be careful, Hinata! I'm not sure how,
but they can move freely in this smoke! It's all right! Even if they take away my sense
of sight and smell, they cannot take away my Byakugan! All right. Stand back, Akamaru! I'm your opponent... What?! Could it be that even
in this smoke screen...? That's right.
I can see all of your attacks! Right here! Just kidding. It can't be! I missed?! That's impossible. But how?! What's this...? What strength! Die! A Shadow Clone... Correct. I can't fight someone as
dangerous as you right away. You've enhanced your muscles
to their limit. Did Orochimaru do that for you? Even if you run away,
you can't defeat me. From what I can see, your weapons are your speed
and your strength. You've got destructive power,
but I specialize in predicting movements. It's pointless to resist.
Come to the village with me. I refuse. It looks like it's begun... First, I need to see how skilled
my enemies and allies are. I should take action as well... How unfortunate. Even though you can see me,
it's pointless. Something's surrounding his body... That's why he's not affected, no matter how much Chakra
I hit him with... It seems that you use
the Gentle Fist. I'm a bad match for you. Do you want that boy to help you? No. If I call Kiba,
it'll be just what he wants... Hinata! Hinata! Crap! Isn't there something I can do?! That's it! This just might work!
Let's go, Akamaru! Over here! He's even faster than before... But his attacks are straightforward!
They're easy to read! What?! Will I make it?! Finish her off, Nurari! Understood. Wh-What's this...?! Once more! Fang Over Fang! K-Kiba...? What is this?! Hinata! Sorry I'm late. H-Hey, are you all right? Kiba, how did you find me? Well, I used the spin of
my Fang Over Fang to stir the air around me. Once the air circulation improved,
that annoying smoke cleared up. With my sense of sight and smell back,
we've got the advantage. You may have done
whatever you wanted before, but prepare yourselves! Are you sure we're  the ones
who should prepare ourselves? Crap! Others were waiting
to ambush us...? Too bad. Well, now that we know all about you... We're going to kill them
with our next attack! - Understood!
- Understood! What?! That's impossible... This feeling. We're surrounded... Hey, Bro?! Kigiri, a smoke screen! Retreat! What?! What the hell are they doing? It seems that the enemy
has good senses as well. Shino! How unfortunate... I was just about to finish casting
a net around them... Is everyone all right? Kakashi Sensei! We're all together. Yeah. But Hinata is... How is it? Can you move? Yes, somewhat... Sensei, did you get that big guy? No... I couldn't get him... I see... They got away from us too. Then the battle's not over yet. There should be
another Jutsu user nearby... Oh? How interesting. I never expected my pursuer to
be Kakashi the Copy Ninja... It may have been too much
for Gozu and Rinji. My preparation went well.
I guess it's my turn! Mother... Say Captain Yamato... are you sure we're closing in
on Kakashi Sensei's team? If things are going according to plan,
he should have left some sign. But I don't see anything like that here. Geez! Did they forget that
we're following right behind them?! Of course not! We should assume something happened
to the search team! Sai, do reconnaissance from the sky. I have a bad feeling about this. Next Time:
"The Labyrinth of Distorted Reflection."

 - It's good!
- Hinata! What are you doing here? N-Nothing. A Valentine's Day chocolate.
Who are you giving it to? - W-Well...
- But this isn't enough! Listen well! Valentine's Day is... a battle that's determined
by the chocolate! Leave this to me! Lingzhi powder for nourishment.
Dragon Turtle extract to relieve fatigue. And grated glutinous yam for healthy skin.
Complete! So anyway,
here are some lovely chocolates! What do you mean, "so anyway"? Umm... I was too afraid
to give it to him... S-Sorry. Oh, wait! Hinata--! Who couldn't she give this to? It's probably Naruto. Oh well. Let's eat! What the heck is this?! HIDDEN LEAF
NINJUTSU RESEARCH CENTER This is the Parasitic Insect
we got from Shino, isn't it? Yes. What's this?! What is this hexagonal pattern?! Well, according the report from
the research team... It means that even the body fluids of
Shino's Parasitic Insect have crystallized. I see... What's the matter, Lady Tsunade? I never thought it truly existed... Do you know something about this? Yes. In the past, a rumor had spread about the existence of a Ninjutsu
that crystallizes all materials. It was said to even crystallize
human blood. It's a Ninjutsu technique
called Crystal Style. It was said that an entire village disappeared
in one night because of it... After it happened, there were no reports by witnesses,
so it was dismissed as rumor. Then, you're saying that
Crystal Style actually existed? Yes. If we relate the fact that
there were no witnesses for a long time and the contact that Kakashi
and the others had, this could possibly be
one of Orochimaru's group. Does that mean that Orochimaru
has begun moving? It's already been three years
since Sasuke left the village. It's right about the time
when Orochimaru could be reincarnated. We should consider that Orochimaru
has begun making preparations for it. We must use that Crystal Style Ninja
as a lead to... to learn Sasuke's whereabouts! The Labyrinth of  
Distorted Reflection  

 Halt! If things were going according to plan,
he would have left some sign. I didn't see anything like that... Man! They better not have forgotten
about the group behind them! They're not you, you know! We should assume something happened
to the search team! - Sai.
- Yes? Can you do reconnaissance from the sky? Understood. Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll. We've got some time
until Sai comes back. Wait for me here a while. We're on duty!
Where do you think you're going? I've gotta pee! Good grief! I don't see anything that looks
like the search team. Camellia? I'd better take this chance to review
my training some more... I've forgotten the timing I had earlier. Huh? What's that?! You're that kid I saw the other day! It is you, after all...
What're you doing here? Not all camellia trees are short.
Some that grow in the wild are this tall. What're you talking about? It's me!
You know, from the hot springs! Everyone has someplace to go home to. Wherever someone's thinking of you,
that's where you go home to. Isn't that what I taught you? Never mind that, though.
You're alone, aren't you? Where are your friends? Your family? The white camellias turned...red... Then they disappeared... All of them. Just as I thought, you're all alone,
aren't you? If that's the case,
do you want to come with us?! Come with us to our hometown. We're on a mission right now, but when we're done,
we'll come back for you. Something just came up. Wait here. I have to wait... Huh?! Where there's someone thinking of me,
that's where I go home to. Yes, that's right! Is there anyone thinking of me?
I hope there is. Could it be that
there's someone thinking of you? When I broke out in a fever,
that person cared for me without sleeping. I see! That shows that person
was thinking of you! I hope so... Listen, follow that person!
Don't let that person go! Uh-huh. - Shino's insect?!
- Naruto... Sorry. I'm on a mission... Huh?! Where'd he go?! Oh well, it seems he has
a place to go home to. We found Shino's Parasitic Insects!
We need to pursue immediately. Right. What took you so long?! Sorry... I ran into someone I knew. He's lying, of course. There's no way he'd run into
someone he knew out here. He was really there, I'm telling you! A boy about this tall and... Humph, you're a pitiful lot! We're ashamed.
Those guys were quite skilled... Well, because of that,
we got a look at what they can do. Kakashi's about the only troublesome one. The first thing we need to do
is stop Kakashi. We can't let those guys interfere
with Lord Orochimaru's plans. I'll see to the rest... The trap is looking good... The seed of the Octangular Jade Crystal placed in the 8 Trigrams
8 Square Formation. When this shines, the light
inside the Jade Crystal will bounce around,
trapped for all eternity. Blossom!
Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Labyrinth! Shino?! Can you follow it?! No problem. Because the only place where
the Parasitic Insects' net was not complete was in this ten o'clock direction. Yeah, looks like we'll have to
determine their objective. - Then, let's go.
- No, hold on. What is it, Shino?! The Parasitic Insects are
behaving strangely... It's as though they can't
find their way out. What do you mean? How do I describe it...? The Parasitic Insects seem to
have lost all of their senses and seem to be wandering aimlessly. Could it be some sort of Genjutsu? They didn't use anything
except physical attacks. No, it's also possible that
they simply chose not to use it on us. You mean they kept their secrets hidden? Hinata, check to see if
there is a Sealing Jutsu or a barrier. Will do. Byakugan! What's the matter, Hinata?! Infinite...images...of us... The Byakugan was overcome? Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Mirror. Lovely as always...
Jade Crystal Clone Jutsu. Seems they were sealed
within some sort of barrier. We thought we had the enemy sealed off
with the Parasitic Insects. But their outer perimeter was further off,
is that it? The enemy! Scatter! Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Blade! So it's a Jutsu that crystallizes material... If it crystallizes the moisture in the air, there are an infinite number
of weapons to use for attacks. We can't let this battle draw out. Kakashi the Copy Ninja... So that's your Sharingan...
But it's no use. My Crystal Style cannot be copied. It's no use! I can't use Byakugan. I hear you've got good eyes... But inside my Jade Crystal,
light is refracted. Your good eyesight works against you. I have more than just Byakugan! You want to fight me face-to-face? What can you do with your eyes sealed? For a long time... I've trained as hard I could
so Naruto would acknowledge my ability. Are you that anxious to die? I might not be at
my cousin Neji's level, but I... Concentrate only on the enemy... Gentle Fist 8 Trigrams 32 Palms! 8 Trigrams 2 Palms! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! It worked! Crystal Style: Jade Crystal Prison! What's happening?! - What happened?
- She just up and left. The same thing happened with me.
Where's Hinata? Here's your friend. Hinata! Damn! What the heck is this?! Crystals... This is unmistakably the enemy's Jutsu.
And it seems huge. - Sai!
- Right! Gotcha. Just as I thought. I think it's about a kilometer across. One kilometer... It must be the work of
someone very skilled. Let's break it down right away. Hold on a minute, Naruto.
There's a kind of barrier here. We can't risk the possibility
that it's been rigged somehow... It's okay. It doesn't react to
an attack from outside. Kakashi Senpai and the others
must be trapped inside. If they're only trapped inside, that's fine. But if there's a trap set up inside,
this is going to be trouble. Captain Yamato,
can't we bust down the wall the way we did when we snuck
into Orochimaru's hideout? I'm afraid that this crystal possesses an extremely tight structure
at the molecular level. Unlike the clay wall,
there are no weak spots. But...if we went from underground... Even the ground itself is encased in crystal.
There are no weak spots at all. It appears very strong. It doesn't look like we could break it
with a Jutsu concentrated at one point. I agree... With something this large,
the force would be dispersed equally, weakening the power of the attack. Yes. It would have to be
a Jutsu that could do both widespread and powerful damage... - Sounds like fun!
- You mustn't, Naruto! I'll be fine, Sakura.
I won't use that Jutsu. Let me try out a Jutsu
I've been working on! Naruto... Summoning Jutsu! - Yo!
- We've been summoned! What? Summoning? Oh...you can do
the Summoning Jutsu, Naruto? What are you going to do
with Summoning Jutsu? Just watch and see! Here's what we're going to do! We haven't perfected it yet,
but it's all we've got! Light sealed inside the Jade Crystal
can never get out. Don't move! If you guys follow us around any longer, your friend will end up
as shattered shards of light! I'm ready to go. Okay listen. Use the timing we worked on earlier
to pour in the Chakra. Right. What are they going to do? Well, let's see what they've got. Let's do it, Gamatatsu! Inhale through the nose! Hold it in... then exhale it all at once! Now! Just as I thought, he's the top Ninja
when it comes to doing the unexpected. What're you doing, Gamatatsu?! Sorry, I forgot to mold the Chakra... Come on!
Or no snacks for you, Gamatatsu! Okay, get yourself together
and we'll try it again! Mold Chakra in your stomach
and inhale through the nose! Hold it in... then exhale it out all at once. Now! Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol! We did it! Naruto, was that...?

 It's the new Jutsu
I made with the Pervy Sage.

 By the way, Senpai,
looks like we're in a bad situation here.

 Yeah, as you can see,
Hinata was taken as a hostage.

 Gamatatsu, can you do
that one more time?

 Sure, but what're you gonna do?

 I have an idea. Let's go, Gamatatsu!

 Yeah!

 Wait, Naruto!

 Collaboration Ninjutsu!
Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol!
 Next Time:
"The Target Appears"

 It took me a long time to
save up for this second-hand TV. I can't wait to watch
Sakura's news program!  On to the next topic... - We have an advisory.
- There's Sakura! I'm sure all of you are aware...
that we're going digital. Gi? Digi...? All analog broadcasts will end
by July 24, 2011 and every station will switch
over to digital broadcasts. All of you currently
watching on analog television sets will need to get digital tuners. Otherwise, you won't be
able to watch any programs. What?! But when we switch over to digital, you'll be able to enjoy Naruto Shippuden
with even better screen and audio clarity. - This is the power of the Jinchuriki.
- Wow, that's amazing! So you've appeared Akatsuki!
Eat this! - Rasengan!
- Rasengan! Please don't make a mistake and
release a Rasengan at the monitor! Sakura... Your warning is too late.

 What?! They broke the barrier.
They're not bad. Guren... Huh? H-Hey! Kakashi Sensei! Humph! Back up, huh? Is everybody all right? Naruto, what was that...? That was Collaboration Ninjutsu with a toad.
We learned it from Pervy Sage. Oh...! Now! It's my turn!
You! There's nowhere to escape! Here comes that really loud guy! Hinata! You! What did you do to Hinata?! What are you going to do,
Kakashi Sensei?! We can't attack them recklessly
since Hinata has been taken hostage. Besides, any small shock will
cause that crystal to shatter. What a mess. - Sai, wait for your chance...
- You realize your situation, - to attack from the sky.
- so just return to the Leaf! Right! - Gamatatsu, can you do that once more?
- If you go back, I'll let this kid go. Yeah...just one more time... I must control my Wind Chakra
so Hinata won't get hurt. Freeze! - Now, Gamatatsu!
- Stop, Naruto! Wind Style: Toad Water Pistol! What?! My Crystal Style can crystallize all materials. You need ten more years of experience
before you can challenge me. Crystal Style: Burst Crystal Falling Dragon. Gamatatsu, run away! Is everyone safe? - Yes!
- Yes! Damn it! What was that?! She crystallized your Jutsu
and turned it into her own Jutsu. Listen, Naruto! I'll get her attention. You protect Hinata,
then pull out from the battle! - What?!
- Hinata's life is the top priority right now. Right. It's useless to hide.
Don't forget I have a hostage! They seem to have given up. Let Hinata go.
Take me as your hostage instead. What?! That's wishful thinking! Now, Naruto! Gamatatsu! I won't let you get away! Damn it! My clothes are so filthy now. Guren! - Are you all right?
- Yeah... I'm relieved. I must say, they ran away rather quickly.
Rinji, don't lose track of them! All right. The Target Appears


 All right, Gamatatsu,
you can bring Hinata out now. Gamatatsu! Gently, gently! Gently, gently. Good! Just like that, slowly, slowly. Oh! A fly! Hinata! You fool! What are you doing, idiot?! Huh?! No! Stop! Please stop! Hinata! Hinata! It...stopped... Damn! We're too late... Pakkun! They finished analyzing
Shino's Parasitic Insect. It appears the enemy's Jutsu
was definitely the Crystal Style. Just as we suspected... And the analyst confirmed that several materials from the crystal
encased the Parasitic Insect. It was true what she said about it
crystallizing all materials. Sai's Super Beast Scroll was also crystallized.
It's a troublesome Jutsu. Not only the Jutsu itself, but also its effects. - So, that means...
- Right... They said that even the biological fluid
of the Parasitic Insect was crystallized. What?! Then... And Hinata?
Is Hinata all right, Kakashi Sensei? Y-Yeah... We should take her
to the village immediately. I know! Grandma Tsunade!
Grandma will help her. Calm down, Naruto! Hinata! Sakura...! Don't worry! She's alive. - Are you sure?
- What a relief! Wow, that scared me... Idiot! How can you be so distracted
by a mere fly?! Wha--? What's the matter, Shino? I was thinking about my Parasitic Insects... After it was defeated by
the Crystal Style Jutsu, the insect shattered in my hand. And yet, Hinata survived... True. When we first encountered
the Crystal Style, it shattered. I wonder what the insect that survived
and Hinata have in common? I... Oh, don't move so soon. When I received the Jutsu... I released my Chakra from
my Chakra Points all at once, to make a thin film in which
to cover myself. I see. That's why, even her Crystal Style
failed to crystallize Chakra. Although you faced the unexpected,
you did a great job, Hinata. Right... Only a Hyuga family member could pull that off.
Hinata, you're awesome! I'm glad you're okay. Sorry you had to worry about me, Naruto... You don't need to apologize. Naruto... Well, Senpai, what are we going to do now? Well... Let's see... I-I'm all right. Don't force yourself just yet. I think we were lucky because Hinata
was the only victim of the Crystal Style... We don't have any countermeasures
against the Crystal Style at this point, so retreating is the best option for now. But then, they'll get away! Right. Unless we stay on the look out,
we'll lose them. It was so much trouble finding them. I'm afraid that if we let them go now,
we'll never find them again... Then here's the plan. We have enough members,
so let's split into two groups. Sai and Sakura, you two stand by here
to wait for Hinata's recovery. - Right!
- Right! The others will track them. But as they move,
they're erasing their scent. It's impossible to track them,
even for Akamaru. It looks like they're extremely cautious. Then how can we find someone
that seems so impossible to track? We can use their monitoring bats. However, if we get too close to a bat,
they'll find us first. So we should be very careful
from this point on. I see... It's a pain, but we don't have a choice... I have something to add. We also should be careful about the
Crystal Style barrier which Naruto just broke. Even if you find them, don't attack.
After all, our goal is to investigate them. - Understood!
- Understood! Then we're going home. We'll see you the next time
we need your help. I'm going home too, Kakashi. Good work today, Pakkun. - See you!
- Good bye! Then let's go, everyone! Guren! Is everything all right? I ran into someone I know. What? Who was that? The man with the headband. Headband? Could it be the guy we just met? How do you know about him? Well... That's right! When I went out with Kabuto the other day,
I met him. The man said he has a place to return to. And he asked me to return with him,
but I didn't. Because I thought that was not
the kind of place where I could return to. Was that just coincidence? I think so. Because there's no way
they saw us and this kid together. Well, what should we do, Guren? There can only be one answer. Good boy, thanks for coming back. It's not them to whom you return,
but to me. Yeah. But if he's your friend,
I want to say hello to him. Where did you see him? Are you going to track them? Yes. Once I decide to go after something,
I stick with it. That's the way I do things. Guren, that's a bad habit. Kabuto! - It's easy for you to go overboard.
-What?! I hope you have some remorse. Based on the story I just heard, I think you were very lucky that
they didn't take Yuukimaru away. If you lose Yuukimaru... Guren, you'll lose credibility
with Lord Orochimaru. Sorry, but you guys must stay here and watch out for the guys
from the Hidden Leaf. We don't want any distractions. What?! We can't come with you?! Rinji, this time just follow
what Kabuto says! All right. If you say so, Guren... Sorry... Let's go. From now on,
the fewer people, the better. Is there something that
you don't want us to see? Well, there's something
you don't see very often. Just wait until you see it. What's the matter? Kabuto... I have a bad feeling... When I took the medicine,
my head really hurt. Don't worry. Nothing will go wrong. When something happens,
Guren will protect you. - Really?
- Y-Yeah. That's true. Damn it! We shouldn't have taken
our eyes off them, even for a moment! We have to start tracking them
all over again! Because of the bats,
we can't move freely! We have no choice.
Shall we try it the risky way? Shino, do you have an idea? Let's change our way of thinking. Not wanting the bats to find us
is a problem. But if we assume the bats will find us,
we can take advantage of them. Huh? What does that mean? The supersonic waves of the bats
won't work far away. When the bats sense our presence,
how do they report it to the enemy? Oh, I get it now! Now that you mention it, you're right. Good work figuring it out, Shino. H-Hold on!
Does everyone understand? Who doesn't understand?
We're all Chunin and Jonin. Oops! There's one Genin. You, are you trying to pick a fight?!
Fine! I understand, too! Really? Let's get back to what
we were talking about. So, what should we do? Let's try it! Naruto, make three Shadow Clones, line them up ten meters away
from each other and have them run around the grounds! But if I do that... Hurry up! I know! Shadow Clone Jutsu! But won't the bats' radar detect us
if I do this?! - That's what we want!
- What? I found them! That must be it! Because there's no reason
for the bats to be flying around during the daytime without
a good reason. All right! Let's go, everyone! By the way,
why are we following the bats? Duh! See, you don't understand, do you?! Those bats will return to their hideout
to let them know they've found us! Um...? That means, if we follow them,
we'll find where the enemy is hiding. Oh, I get it! Good grief! You're still no good. Humph! Stop being so bossy,
just because you're a Chunin! Take this! That stinks! Heh, heh! Look at yourself! Every time I come to this place,
I feel really weird... What are you going to do here? Well... I'll perform a little test. With him and...Guren. Here, put this on. If you give him that much medicine...! Huh? Are you trying to disrupt
Lord Orochimaru's plan? I really must have you for this mission. In fact, you're the only one who can do it. Only me? Then perhaps, I may want to reconsider... who is the best suited to become my vessel. Don't worry. Let's start something fun. This medicine is different from
what you took before. This medicine won't bring you
any suffering. You can't go back until you take this. Guren, it's your turn. Stop being so bossy all the time! Crystal Style:
Jade Crystal Hexagonal Column! Oh! What? What is going to happen? What is this...? Be careful! It's coming! It's coming? The test was successful! It'll appear! What will appear?! A Tailed Beast. Tailed Beast...? This is the Three-Tailed Beast. What's that feeling...?

 What's the matter, Shino?

 My insects...feel a weird Chakra.

 Weird Chakra?

 They've never felt so much Chakra before.

 It looks like Akamaru feels
the same thing as your insects!

 What's going on over there?!

 Let's hurry, we'll go straight through!

 Next Time:
"The Rampaging Tailed Beast"


 Wh-What're these? Cancer cells? - Ah! Sorry.
- What...?! - Ahem! I put on some weight.
- I gained weight, too. My weight hasn't changed much... Why are you comparing them? Shino? Oh! Hey, you still have your clothes on... It doesn't matter how heavy my clothes are... because I can control my weight,
depending on how many insects I have. Wow, it's so convenient. 56.6 kg... Not bad for today. - You don't need...
- a scale! To be continued Oh, Senpai! Over there...
There's a dango shop! Let's take a break. We've been walking all day.
I'm exhausted! You don't look exhausted at all. Why are you so easygoing? But Senpai, we're trying to
catch a Tailed Beast, yet we don't even know where it is. So let's just take it easy. By the way,
what are we going to catch again? Three-Tails! Three-Tails! One-Tail, Two-Tails... And I'm Tobi! Duh! Here's dango for you. Wow! It looks yummy!
Let's see... Munch time! Man, it's so good!
This sauce is really good. It's not too sweet, nor too salty.
It's a masterpiece! Ahh... It was great. Oh, Senpai, Senpai. Look at that! Huh? That looks exactly like your work, doesn't it? Could it be that your work is...
a rip-off? You...! I'm going to kill you! The Rampaging Tailed Beast

 Th-This is... The Three-Tails is about to appear! What's this feeling...? What's the matter, Shino? My insects...feel a weird Chakra. Weird Chakra? They've never felt so much Chakra before. It looks like Akamaru feels
the same thing as your insects! Then it must be there! Let's hurry up. This feeling... It's like highly charged air
and a frantic feeling... This isn't from the guys
from the Hidden Leaf. What's happening? Right there?! What the heck is that?
A fog...? It looks like the bats are flying
toward the fog. No question about it! A huge amount of Chakra
is coming from over there. Is it inside that fog? Yes, but we can't identify it. Let's dive in and find out! Hey, slow down. Let's get ready first. Heh! That's what I wanted to hear! Everyone, prepare for action!
But don't rush! - Roger!
- Roger! Understood! They're increasing in number. Did they call for reinforcements? I think they can easily see us! It doesn't matter!
Let's drop in! We're at a disadvantage number-wise. Let's buy some time until
Guren gets here! Kihou, lay a smoke screen! Understood. Kakashi Senpai! A smoke screen...
They're lying in wait for us. But if we stay here too long, we won't be able to find out
what's happening at the lake. We should split into two groups... Naruto, you go by yourself. What?! I'm not attacking? Our main mission is to research the lake. Oh, that's right... We'll create a diversion and
you head off to the center of the lake. But don't attack. Yes, understood. Are you sure? Only Naruto...? Let's show him a bit of trust. No one is a better survivor than Naruto. Good luck, Naruto. You're definitely
the Number One Unpredictable Ninja in the Hidden Leaf. No reaction...
It looks like nobody's here. Let's go! Damn it! I can't see anything. Did they escape already? They must be buying time. Keep your guard up! All right, I think from here... I'm going to head into
the lake! I went in too deep... Snack for me. Hey, right after we got home,
you called us over here! You're such a toad driver! Come on, I'll give you something in return. But, this intense Chakra...
I wonder what's behind the fog? It's coming! This is the Three-Tails... It's more than we expected... What is this? This intimidation...! We did it... It was a success. Yuukimaru is controlling the Three-Tails! Yuukimaru! Damn! If he keeps using his power...! If he fails,
what will happen to the Three-Tails? Your job is to stop that from happening! Even Yuukimaru's power can't control
 the Three-Tails...! Yuukimaru! What's that sound?! Guren!
Stop this beast immediately! Stop being so bossy! This beast!
Although he's huge, he's quick! Right now! Gozu! Hurry! Crystal Style! Divine Pathway Jutsu! There! My crystal shattered?! Giant! Crystal Hexagonal Shuriken! This is so hard! Muddy turtle! Guren! What are you doing? Are you trying to kill the Three-Tails?!
Contain him! Or we'll all die! Large-scale Jutsu need preparation! It's too late! Gozu...! Hurry... Crystal Style!
Crystal Wall, 8th Formation! Eat this, turtle bastard! She did it...! Crystal Style... I never knew Guren
had this much ability... I used a bit too much...Chakra... Hey Shino,
don't get too close to me! I wouldn't get too close to you. Then why did your shoulder brush
against me?! Because our circle is getting small. Keep your mouth shut!
Focus on finding the enemy. But, Kakashi Sensei! Above us! Watch out! Our ambush failed! Kakashi Sensei! Thanks Sakura, Sai. Hinata, are you better already? Yeah! But still, how did she...? I see, her Byakugan... We'd better be careful with
 that little girl's Jutsu. Even if we were in a smoke screen,
she would find us... Damn it! What kind of place is this?! There's not one wave,
and no sign of fish. It's really weird... I see something. Oh! It's a turtle!
There's a turtle inside! Brother! What kind of turtle is this? Na-Naruto, th-this is a Tailed Beast! Tailed Beast? Yeah! It's the Three-Tails! Three-Tails...? Even that huge Jutsu couldn't stop it?! Guren! Take Yuukimaru and run! Gozu! You, too! Gozu, protect Yuukimaru! All right! Guren...! You fight with me! She's...! Why is she fighting with the Three-Tails?! Guren! What are you doing here...?! Don't tell me... Where there's someone thinking of me,
that's where I go home to. His place to return is...
with them?! Don't underestimate me...
Muddy turtle! Guren! This camellia will never wither. As long as I'm alive. Guren... Gozu...! What are you doing?! Take Yuukimaru and...
get out of here! Guren... I figured out where to return home to. You... What?! The Three-Tails
has stopped moving. It can't be...! He...can control the Three-Tails?! What?! Kakashi Senpai! That's...! What?! That's the dimension where
 the Three-Tails appeared! If we're swallowed by it...! Are you all right? So warm... Here! You... This is...! Yuukimaru...! All my Chakra is going to this Jutsu...! This time, I'll hold your hand... I heard that the Three-Tails disappeared
after the last Great War. Orochimaru has gotten involved
with something troubling. Perhaps the fact
that we discovered it first is a blessing in disguise. Yes... We cannot hand it over to anyone. We'll capture it then? I don't think it will be easy... I'm going to look it up
in our existing documents. I want you to summon these members. Next Time: "Inside the Mist"

 Huh? I didn't know...
Sai is one year older than us, huh? That makes him the same
as Bushy Brow, eh? Wow! You mean Captain Yamato
looks like that, and he's only 26?! Huh?! With those old looks? His hobby is
"reading books on architecture." Ugh! How gloomy... Huh? The Captain and Iruka Sensei
are the same age. You're right... Oh my, says here his hobby is
"medicinal hot spas." He's like a totally old dude. By the way, did you know, Sakura?
Shizune's 31. Huh? That's older than I thought... Right? Right? Which means that "Ahii!" reaction
has to be forced, right? Sh-Shizune! I want to hear that again... Ahii!
